# `#BlackInDataWeek`

> Amplifying Black folx in `#informatics`, `#datascience`, & `#coding` around the world  

Follow along via the [`#BlackInDataWeek` hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackInDataWeek).  

A week-long celebration `#BlackInDataWeek` to:  

- (1) highlight the valuable work and experiences of Black people in the field of Data  
- (2) provide community  
- (3) educational and professional resources.

To learn more about `#BlackInDataWeek`, please see [their website](https://blkindata.github.io/).

The `#TidyTuesday` community will be taking a break from our own data this week and asking you to engage with, promote, and support Black people in data.

You're welcome to revisit older datasets from `#TidyTuesday` this week, but especially on Thursday Nov 19th, please create space and engage with the [`#BlackInDataViz` hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23blackindataviz&src=typed_query) on Twitter rather than promoting your own work.

From the [`#BlackInDataViz` website](https://blkindata.github.io/project/blackindataviz/):  

> Creating space for Black people in data to share their work in the form of favourite data visualisation images. Also hosting a competition for data visualisation using a shared dataset, further reinforcing community. We will also host a ‘Data Viz in a Day’ skills workshop, focusing on instructing beginners on creating data visualizations.

We don't have our own dataset this week, but the data below returns the purpose, date, hashtag, and link to each day's events to follow along with.

### Get the data here

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-11-17')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, week = 47)

black_in_data <- tuesdata$black_in_data

# Or read in the data manually

black_in_data <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-11-17/black_in_data.csv')
