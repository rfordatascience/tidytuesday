"Thank you so much. Hi, baby. Thank you to the Grammy voters for the incredible honor. Thank you to everyone who worked so hard to beautifully capture the profundity of deep southern culture. I thank god for my family, my wonderful husband, my beautiful daughter my fans for bringing me so much happiness and support. We all experience pain and loss, and often we become inaudible. My intention for the film and album was to create a body of work that would give a voice to our pain, our struggles, our darkness and our history. To confront issues that make us uncomfortable. It's important to show images to my children to reflect their beauty, so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror, first at their own families, as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the white house and the Grammy's and see themselves and have no doubt that they're beautiful, intelligent and capable. This is something I want for every child of every race, and I feel its vital that we learn from the past and recognize our tendencies to repeat our mistakes. Thank you again for honoring Lemonade. Have a beautiful evening. Thank you for tonight, this is incredible",2985000,"2017 Grammy's Best Urban Contemporary Album Speech",498,"Beyoncé",1

"I wanted to give all of my fans something extra because this album was so special to me. And it came so effortlessly after I finished the film of my life, ""Dreamgirls"". Because I was so inspired by Deena, I wrote songs that were saying all the things I wish she would have said in the film. And I wanted to give you an extra special song that Deena sings. It's a pivotal moment when Deena finally does get the strength to stand up for herself and does know who she is and knows what she wants. I'm sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics.

"We need to stop buying into the myth about gender equality. It isn’t a reality yet. Today, women make up half of the U.S. workforce, but the average working woman earns only 77 percent of what the average working man makes. But unless women and men both say this is unacceptable, things will not change. Men have to demand that their wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters earn more— commensurate with their qualifications and not their gender. Equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect.",338488,"Gender Equality is a Myth!",498,"Beyoncé",1
"Humanity requires both men and women, and we are equally important and need one another. So why are we viewed as less than equal? These old attitudes are drilled into us from the very beginning. We have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect, so that as they grow up, gender equality becomes a natural way of life. And we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible",338488,"Gender Equality is a Myth!",498,"Beyoncé",2
"We have a lot of work to do, but we can get there if we work together. Women are more than 50 percent of the population and more than 50 percent of voters. We must demand that we all receive 100 percent of the opportunities",338488,"Gender Equality is a Myth!",498,"Beyoncé",3

"I see music. It's more than just...what I hear. When I'm connected to something, I immediately see a visual or a series of images that are tied to a feeling or emotion. A memory from my childhood, thoughts about life, my dreams or my fantasies and they're all connected to the music. And I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to do a visual album; I wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in my head, cause it's what makes it mine. That vision in my brain is what I want people to experience the first time",309194,"""Self-Titled"" Part 1 . The Visual Album",498,"Beyoncé",1
"I feel like, right now, people experience music differently. I remember seeing Thriller on TV with my family. It was an event; we all sat around the TV and now, looking back, I'm so lucky I was born around that time. I miss that...immersive experience. Now, people only listen to a few seconds of a song on their iPods - they don't really invest in a full album. It's all about the single and the hype, there's so much that gets between the music and the artist and the fans. I felt like 'I don't want anybody to give the message when my record is comnig out. I just want this to come out when it's ready and from me to my fans'. I told my team 'I wanna shoot a video for every song and put them all out at the same time', everyone thought I was crazy but we're actually doing it. It's happening",309194,"""Self-Titled"" Part 1 . The Visual Album",498,"Beyoncé",2
"I wanted to make this body of work and, I feel like it's something that's lost in Pop music. I wanted people to hear things differently and have a different first impression. Not just listen to a ten second clip but see the whole vision of the album. It was important that we made this a movie, we made this an experience. I wanted everyone to see the whole picture and to see how personal everything is to me. I would make my best art and just put it out and that's-that's why it's out today",309194,"""Self-Titled"" Part 1 . The Visual Album",498,"Beyoncé",3
"There's a moment where things click. When I was in the studio I was threading the songs together and I...thought of this performance which was a really defining moment in my life as a child. In my mind we would perform on Star Search, we would win; we would get a record deal and that was my dream at the time. There's no way in the world I would ever imagine losing as a possbility. You know, I was only 9 years old so, at that time, you don't realise that you could actually work super hard and give everything you have and lose! It was the best message for me. When I put Ed MacMahon introducing us as ""the Hip-Hop rapping Girls' TYME"" it clicked something in my mind. I feel like something about the aggression of Bow Down and the attitude of Flawless - the reality is, sometimes you lose. And you're never too good to lose, you're never too big to lose, you're never too smart to lose; it happens, and it happens when it needs to happen. And you have to embrace those things",309173,"""Self-Titled"" Part 2 . Imperfection",498,"Beyoncé",1

"My message behind this album is finding the beauty in imperfection. I had this image of this trophy and me accepting these awards and kind of training myself to be this champion. And at the end of the day when you go through all of these things, is it worth it? I mean, you get this trophy and you're like, 'I basically starved, I have neglected all of the people that I love, I've conformed to what everybody else thinks I should be and I have this trophy. What does that mean?'. The trophy represents all of the sacrafices I made as a kid. All of the time that I lost, being on the road/ in the studios as a child. And, I just wanna throw that shit up",309173,"""Self-Titled"" Part 2 . Imperfection",498,"Beyoncé",3
"I have a lot of awards and I have a lot of these things that I'm amazing and I'm - I worked my ass of, I worked harder then probably everybody I know to get those things but nothing feels like my child saying 'Mommy'. No, nothing feels like when I look at my husband in the eyes, nothing feels like when I'm respected, when I get on the stage and I see I'm changing people's lives. Those are the things that matter and, at this point in my life, that's what I'm striving for. Growth, love, happiness, fun; enjoying your life, it's short - that's the message",309173,"""Self-Titled"" Part 2 . Imperfection",498,"Beyoncé",4
