# Rap Artists

The data this week comes from [BBC Music](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-who-voted) by way of [Simon Jockers at Datawrapper](https://blog.datawrapper.de/best-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-visualized/).

The raw data can be found on his [Github](https://github.com/sjockers/bbc-best-rapmusic). Album covers were retrived from Spotify, and you can access them via the Spotify API.

> Earlier this year, BBC Music asked more than 100 critics, artists, and other music industry folks from 15 countries for their five favorite hip-hop tracks. Then they broke down the results of the poll into one definitive list. But BBC Music didnâ€™t just publish a best-of list, they also published the complete poll results and a description of the simple algorithm they ranked the songs with. - Simon Jockers

> We awarded 10 points for first ranked track, eight points for second ranked track, and so on down to two points for fifth place. The song with the most points won. We split ties by the total number of votes: songs with more votes ranked higher. Any ties remaining after this were split by first place votes, followed by second place votes and so on: songs with more critics placing them at higher up the lists up ranked higher. -- BBC Music
