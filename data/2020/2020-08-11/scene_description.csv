2033,[Points to Team Avatar who has hijacked the pirate ship.]

2070,"[Camera zooms in to close-up shot of Aang, Katara, and Sokka, the siblings sitting next to each other with bored faces, and Aang standing with his back to the camera. Momo screeches and the gang looks around.]"
2072,"[Aang uses his airbending to fly to the top of the tree, jumping from trunk-to-trunk to get higher. He finds the traps' mechanisms, undoes them, and carefully lowers Momo to the ground where Katara and Sokka are waiting. They open the trap together and the lemur runs out with one of the lychee nuts in his mouth. Katara and Sokka look on as Momo gets on his hind legs and eats it as though nothing has happened. Sokka grunts in frustration and facepalms. When Aang lands, he looks up to see the other two animals seemingly crying out to him for help.]"
2072,[Jumps up to them.]
2073,[Throws his boomerang to simply cut the animals free.]

2194,[Whispers.]
2204,[Pipsqueak holds the prisoner and Smellerbee steps up to search the poor man.]
2207,[She holds up the old man's bag. The old man is thrown back on the ground.]
2213,"[Aang is wearing a bag and pulls a small pellet from it. With a sly grin, he tosses it next to Momo, where it explodes with a pop. Momo puffs up like a startled cat. He hisses and lunges for the bag. Momo sits on Aang's shoulder and tosses several pellets at his feet. Aang dances about wildly.]"

2297,"[Sokka sprints off in the direction of the snares. Smellerbee makes a grab for him, but misses.]"
2298,"[They give chase. Sokka leaps over the leaf piles. Pipsqueak and Smellerbee don't, and end up snared and hanging many feet up in the air.]"

2376,[Grinning while gloating.]
2376,"[Turns his head to see Momo and Appa fighting over a watermelon. Momo continuously tries to fly away with it, while Appa pins it down. Aang takes the melon and uses airbending to slice it. Momo seems to be complaining about how he got the much smaller half and Appa got the bigger half.]"
2376,[Appa eats his half of the melon.]
2379,[In awe.]
2379,[Zoom backward to show Sokka in the foreground.]
2383,[Shoving past Sokka.]
2385,"[Oblivious to the fact that Sokka is behind him, mocking him.]"
2392,[Whistles to them.]
2396,"[The Zhang tribe members yell out in protest behind them. Katara and Aang look at each other worriedly, but turn around to see a large pile of rocks being levitated up and thrown away. The canyon guide stands behind where the rocks used to be.]"

2426,[To the people on Appa.]
2426,[To Appa.]
2426,[Appa roars and takes off. The camera fades to show both groups of people climbing down into the canyon. The tour guide earthbends to form a bridge in a gap in the path.]
2428,[Turns to the travelers.]

2511,[Stops him as he runs forward.]

5344,[Turning to Mai.]
5344,[Teasing.]
5346,[Cut closer to Azula who continues on a serious tone.]
5352,[Somewhat enthusiastically.]
5354,"[Angrily, with his arms folded.]"
5355,[A peasant woman strolls past; somewhat dramatically.]
5356,[Withdrawing a coin from her sleeve.]
5359,[Smiling.]
5359,[He pulls the piece from his pocket with a flourish.]
5360,[Annoyed.]
5361,[Standing up.]
5361,"[He puts the hat down and stands up, swaying lightly as he begins to sing.]"
5362,[Annoyed with the quality of the entertainment.]
5362,[Zuko glances up sharply as the man withdraws his swords.]
5364,[Singing.]
5365,[Stops slicing and laughs.]
5365,[Tosses the gold coin onto the ground and walks away.]
5366,[Dramatically; close to tears.]
5368,[To Aang.]
5368,[Aang continues to stare at the swamp.]
5368,[Aang snaps out of the trance.]
5369,[Confused.]
5372,[Moving to the front of the saddle.]
5373,[He still seems somewhat dazed by the swamp.]
5374,[Holding his stomach.]
5376,[Shrugging.]
5383,[Resignedly.]
5383,[Looks at swamp.]
5383,[Shakes Appa's rope.]
5385,[Panicked.]
5387,[Looking around the swamp and at his friends.]
5387,"[Aang jumps up to the top of the trees, looking for his animal friends as he uses the height to search for them.]"
5389,[Pointing blandly.]
5390,"[He spins around, panicking, trying to find it.]"
5392,[Crosses her arms; sarcastically.]
5393,[Ripping off the elbow leech and throwing it behind to Katara. He cries out angrily.]
5396,[Jumping down into the muddy water.]
5398,[Cutting the vines with his machete.]
5399,[To Sokka.]
5400,[Continuing to cut the vines.]
5404,[Yelling.]
5408,[Indicating.]
5410,"[Sweating, his voice cracking.]"
5413,[Grabs a nearby root.]
5413,[Shakes the root and fakes a reply.]
5421,[His calm demeanor vanishing.]
5426,[Points his stick at the footprint.]
5431,[Grinning.]
5433,[Calling out.]
5435,[She squints.]
5435,[More loudly and running toward the figure.]
5439,[While slashing at the vines.]
5439,"[He becomes caught, and grunts with exertion before slicing himself free.]"
5441,"[He takes a hold of his head, before removing his hands and shrugging, turning away from the apparition.]"
5441,"[Almost fearfully, he turns around and walks closer.]"
5442,[Accusingly.]
5448,[He holds his hand out as though to grab her.]
5454,[He moves to the front of the boat.]
5456,[Annoyed.]
5457,[Shrugging as he tries to appease his friend.]
5459,[He shrugs again.]
5464,[He stands up and puts his machete away.]
5465,"[She has not moved, although her hand is on her head as she sits on the root they have fallen onto.]"
5466,[He looks away before airbending himself to his feet. He appears embarrassed that he was not actively searching for his friends like they were him.]
5468,[He walks over to Katara and helps her up before rubbing his ear.]
5469,"[Sarcastically, with exaggerated hand movements.]"
5472,[Surprised.]
5473,"[He looks away for a moment, before turning back and taking a step closer to his sister.]"
5479,[He raises his arms above his head.]
5485,[Demanding offensively.]
5486,[The vines drop to reveal a slightly larger man wearing nothing but a leaf loincloth.]
5487,"[He shares a look of confusion with Sokka, who is also in an offensive stance.]"
5492,[Bending a vine out of the way.]
5493,[He finally puts his machete away.]
5494,"[He sits on the tree, looking at the group as he explains.]"
5495,[Humoring Huu.]
5496,"[The camera zooms out as he explains, slowly revealing more and more of the swamp. It shows how large the banyan-grove tree is compared to the others, but at the final magnification, it is impossible to distinguish it from the other trees.]"
5497,"[Cuts back to Aang, looking at Huu. He is still openly skeptical.]"
5498,[Another shot shows the swamp river. There are the sounds of several animals heard in the background.]
5499,"[She and her friends are now sitting, listening to Huu.]"
5500,"[The shot cuts to show the people that Sokka and Katara saw in the swamp, before cutting back to Huu.]"
5503,[He looks down as he tries to understand.]
5506,[Aang kneels down and places his hand on the tree.]
5506,"[Energy travels from Aang's hand to Appa's location. Appa is seen being captured by the Foggy Swamp members. Back at the banyan-grove tree, Aang stands up.]"
5508,[Singing and tapping the side of his canoe. Momo is seen struggling inside the sack he has been placed in.]
5515,"[Due ceases waterbending, followed by a slightly disgusted Katara. He watches as Sokka and Huu run up to the branch Katara and Aang are standing on.]"
5520,[He indicates the catgator lying behind Tho.]
5525,[Laughing.]
5527,[Smiling. Sokka is shown chewing nonchalantly next to her.]
5531,[To Katara.]
5531,[He raises his arms for emphasis.]
5535,[Feeding Momo.]
5536,[To Huu.]
5544,[Angrily.]
5544,"[Momo chitters happily while lying upside down on Sokka's belly, chewing on the fly he ""rescued"" from the spider's web.]"
5546,[Shouting from up above as he looks over the campsite.]
5548,[Crawling toward Appa.]
5551,[Shocked.]
5555,[Stretching out his arm over the saddle as if he wants to grab it.]
5557,[Grabbing Sokka's arm.]
5558,[Annoyed.]
5558,[Turning to Katara.]
5558,[Turning toward Aang.]
5558,[Looking back at Katara with his hand on his chest.]
5559,[Cheerfully.]
5560,[Bowing his head in defeat by this totally honest answer.]
5562,[To a sulking Sokka.]
5564,[Sadly.]
5564,[He jumps up and moves Aang's hat slightly so that he can point at Aang's arrow.]
5564,[Makes a hair loopies gesture with a somewhat bored look.]
5567,"[He picks up the basket full of supplies, looking dejected at the nickname.]"
5569,"[Surprised, after inspecting the money.]"
5571,[Clutching the coin.]
5571,"[The merchant closes his shop, while Katara walks over to Aang, who is trying to console a crying Sokka as the camera pans up to show just the merchant's head.]"
5572,[Interested.]
5573,[Turning around while waving.]
5577,[Pointing at the float.]
5579,[Roku effigy rolls by.]
5582,[He takes a huge bite out of the food-item he is holding.]
5583,[Pointing at a giant float of Aang coming down the street.]
5586,[Sniffs.]
5588,[Surprised.]
5590,[Chanting as Kyoshi's effigy is consumed by the flames.]
5592,[Wondering.]
5593,"[Angrily, while walking away.]"
5594,[Seriously.]
5594,[Takes a bite out of one of the cupcakes Zuko brought. The jam drips of his chin. In delight.]
5596,[Angrily pointing an accusing finger at Katara.]
5598,[Angered.]
5598,[He takes off his hat and throws it away to reveal his arrow.]
5599,[Pointing in shock at Aang.]
5600,[Scared.]
5603,[Crawling back on his feet.]
5603,[He waves them away with a gesture of his hand.]
5606,[Landing beside Katara.]
5608,[Calmly.]
5608,[Raising his voice.]
5609,[Utterly shocked.]
5610,[Lisping and slurring.]
5610,[Pointing at himself as the camera zooms in on him.]
5612,[Frightened by the appearances of the old man.]
5613,[Katara places her arms on Aang's shoulders and starts to defend him.]
5613,[Shaking her head in disapproval before pointing an accusing finger at the villagers.]
5614,[Raising his arm to emphasize his remark.]
5618,[Confidently.]
5622,[Apologetically.]
5626,[Upbeat.]
5626,"[Theatrically jumps back and pretends to airbend by blowing air. Katara looks ashamed for her brother. He moves to the back of the room to ""cut"" the air.]"
5626,[He makes a grotesque movement with his arm before thrusting his face in the camera.]
5626,"[He resumes his place beside Katara, who is still looking annoyed by her brother. He makes a circular motion with his hands and points toward the door.]"
5628,[Slightly mocking.]
5628,[Serious tone as she looks at Aang.]
5629,[Unhappy.]
5631,[Cunningly.]
5632,[Content.]
5633,[Aiding Aang by playing Sokka's ego.]
5634,[Bragging.]
5634,"[Katara holds her hand to her brow, annoyed by Sokka's monologue.]"
5634,"[Aang is making fun of Sokka, Katara holds her hand to her mouth to refrain herself from bursting out in laughs.]"
5636,"[Pretends to ponder about the question. Katara stares at him, trying to figure out what he is doing.]"
5636,"[The camera spins around. When it stops again, Sokka is wearing a hat with a monocle.]"
5636,[Katara looks surprised at his new outfit and giggles. Sokka extends his monocle to investigate her.]
5638,"[Cut to Sokka, who inquisitively looks around. He gazes directly into the camera lens through his magnifying glass, making his left eye appear huge. He moves on to investigate the walls of the shrine, while the mayor is standing at the edge of the cliff, pointing down at something.]"
5638,[Sokka quickly squats beside the footprint to take a closer look at it.]
5638,"[They all look up at a statue of Chin the Great, who has a raised left hand in triumph.]"
5640,[Runs back over to the statue.]
5641,[Excitedly drawing her conclusions.]
5643,[Shouting.]
5643,[Pointing at the temple.]
5644,[Disappointed.]
5645,"[Blows soap bubbles with his dragon shaped pipe, while thinking about their next course of action.]"
5647,[Surprised.]
5649,"[Aang looks up in wonder to see who is talking. Switch to Aang's angle of view. A man is standing in the shadows, only his outline is visible.]"
5649,"[The man emerges from the shadows. He has a strong build, earrings in both ears, and his body has a large snake tattoo that covers the top of his chest and down his right arm. He suddenly charges Aang, letting out a load growl. He is stopped in his tracks by the chains around his neck. Aang slides down the wall in fear, while the man addresses him calmly.]"
5651,[Angrily stamping her foot on the ground.]
5652,[Gently breaks the news to Koko.]
5654,[Nagging.]
5658,[Shocked.]
5660,[With feigned casualness.]
5663,[He disappointedly slants his eyes.]
5666,[Approvingly.]
5669,[He picks up one of the fans and waves it back and forth.]
5670,[Sternly.]
5671,[Squatting beside a really big pair of brown boots.]
5673,[Proudly.]
5674,[Realizing something.]
5674,[A flashback shows the much smaller footprint they saw at the edge of the cliff outside Chin Village.]
5674,[She happily exclaims her findings.]
5676,[Annoyed.]
5677,[Sarcastically.]
5677,[She bows slightly in a mocking gesture.]
5678,[Dramatically raises his hand in the air.]
5678,[Showing his own boots to Oyaji.]
5678,[Moves toward Katara to explain everything to her.]
5679,[Unimpressed.]
5679,[Rolls her eyes.]
5681,[In a very friendly voice that does not stroke with his scary appearances.]
5683,[Hopeful.]
5687,[Doubtful.]
5690,[Smiling sincerely.]
5691,[Tears stream down his face while he talk in a very soft voice.]
5691,[He dries his tears and sniffs.]
5693,[Sokka investigates the painting thoroughly.]
5694,"[Sokka spins around in shock, spitting out some of the bubbles he swallowed. Very surprised.]"
5694,[He grabs Oyaji by his collar.]
5695,[He pulls himself free from Sokka's grasp and throws him back a little.]
5696,[Staring at the painting again.]
5696,[Addresses Katara.]
5699,[Shoves Katara out of the way as she yelps.]
5699,[Points his pipe dramatically toward the camera upon making his conclusion.]
5703,[Dismissive.]
5705,"[He points to himself, before pointing to Aang.]"
5705,"[Everyone gasps at once, horrified by this news.]"
5707,[Emotionally.]
5709,"[Very deep, monotone voice.]"
5710,"[Raises his hand before his mouth to say some quiet, encouraging words.]"
5711,"[Still tied up, unsure.]"
5711,[He shifts his eyes to the left while he is trying to remember what to say. Enthusiastically.]
5711,[Raises his finger to count along but blanks out.]
5712,[Whispers.]
5713,[The camera tilts down to reveal his small feet. The villagers are unimpressed by his argument.]
5713,"[The villagers look from one to the other, not knowing where Aang is going with this.]"
5713,[He quickly ends his exposition with a big smile.]
5715,[Mumbles to Katara while they continue to smile.]
5717,"[He picks up a big, gold-colored teapot.]"
5718,[Lazily resting against a tree trunk.]
5719,[He puts the pot down.]
5719,[Iroh walks over to Zuko and squats down beside him.]
5719,[Places a hand on Zuko's shoulder who closes his eyes as if he was holding something back.]
5721,[Sighs.]

5741,[Kyoshi calmly walks toward him to face his challenge.]
5747,[Confused.]
5748,[Awkwardly.]
5749,[Standing up in the background.]
5749,[He brushes himself off and points at Aang.]
5751,[Switch to a close-up of Iroh with Zuko on the background.]
5752,[Iroh's sad expression clears up as he hears Zuko talk.]
5753,[Iroh's brightened expression quickly disappears again.]
5755,[Calling after Zuko.]
5757,"[Deep, monotonous voice.]"
5761,[Hoping.]
5764,[Begging.]
5766,[Monotone.]
5768,[Close-up.]
5768,"[Kahchi swings his Guan Dao back and forth, slicing through the statue of Chin the Great. While it crumbles down, Mongke continues with a grin.]"

5776,[Raising his hand while shouting his command.]
5778,[Raises his arms in the air and exclaims ecstatically.]
