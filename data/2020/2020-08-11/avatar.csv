1,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Katara,"Water. Earth. Fire. Air. My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days: a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar mastered all four elements; only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed, and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads and that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope. I still believe that, somehow, the Avatar will return to save the world.","Water. Earth. Fire. Air.

2,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Scene Description,"As the title card fades, the scene opens onto a shot of an icy sea before panning slowly to the left, revealing more towering icebergs drifting in the water as the shot rotates, moving over a large snow-covered area where the untouched blanket of snow is broken by two tracks of footsteps. The shot fades to another shot of the sea and of icebergs in blue water contrasted by the paleness of the sky beyond. As the shot once again pans to the left and rotates likewise, a small canoe comes into view, its motion through the water indicated by the wake left behind it. The shot zooms slightly on the canoe before cutting down to it, providing a side angle of the canoe and of the walls of ice rising on either side of the vessel. Two people, a boy and a girl, are sitting in the boat; the boy holds a spear at the ready, while the girl simply stares into the water on the other side of the boat. The shot cuts to an overhead view, revealing that a fish is swimming close to the surface right in front of the boy, who is focused on it, following its every movement. Cut to a frontal view of him.",NA,"‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1
3,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Sokka,"It's not getting away from me this time. [Close-up of the boy as he grins confidently over his shoulder in the direction of the girl.] Watch and learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish.","It's not getting away from me this time.  Watch and learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish.","‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1
4,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Scene Description,"The shot pans quickly from the boy to Katara, who seems indifferent to his claim and turns back to her side of the boat again. Her expression changes to surprise; as the shot jumps behind her, looking down into the water over her shoulder, another fish quickly swims by her, close to where she sits. She shoots a quick glance toward her brother, removing the glove from her left hand. She stretches her arm out in the direction of the fish, taking a deep breath. Her look is a mixture of concentration and apprehension as she starts making a wavy motion with her wrist, moving her hand up and down.
The shot widens out; Sokka, still focused wholly on the fish in front of him, is completely unaware of what is happening behind his back. As Katara continues to move her hand, the water in front of Katara, just in front of the shot, starts to ripple. Suddenly, a bubble of water rises up from the ocean containing the newly trapped fish.",NA,"‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1

6,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Sokka,"[Close-up of Sokka; whispering.] Sshh! Katara, you're going to scare it away. [A look of bliss adorns his face. He licks his lips and wiggles his fingers, not taking his eyes off the fish.] Mmmm ... I can already smell it cookin'.","Sshh! Katara, you're going to scare it away.  Mmmm ... I can already smell it cookin'.","‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1
7,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Scene Description,"Behind Sokka, Katara is still making circular movements with both her arms, suspending the bubble of water that holds the fish in the air and moving back and forth. The camera cuts to her face, contorted slightly by the focus it takes to control the water.",NA,"‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1

9,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Scene Description,"The bubble containing her fish slowly drifts around her to hang over Sokka, who is still oblivious. As the bubble hovers over his head, Sokka raises his spear to strike the fish he was following. He bursts the bubble of water with the blunt end of his weapon, causing Katara to lose control of the water; it rains down on Sokka, soaking him.",NA,"‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1

11,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Scene Description,"As Sokka lets out a gasp of discomfort, the fish tumbles through the air and Katara follows its arc with her eyes as it flies over her head and splashes back into the sea. Sokka rounds on his sister, placing his spear perpendicular to the rim of the boat as he yells irately. The shot cuts to a close-up of him.",NA,"‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1

Meanwhile, Katara has crossed her arms.] that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself.","Yeah, yeah, ""an ancient art unique to our culture"", blah, blah, blah.

16,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Katara,"[Cut to her face as she raises an eyebrow skeptically, arms still crossed.] You're calling me weird?

I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself every time I see my reflection in the water!,"‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1
17,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Scene Description,"Near the end of her response, Katara smiles smugly at her brother; as the shot cuts to him, he is flexing at his reflection in the water and grinning confidently. His happy look vanishes upon hearing his sister's remark and he turns around slowly, meaning to face her. Before he can say anything, however, the canoe suddenly shudders. As they both try to keep from falling over, Sokka whirls around toward his end of the canoe, a frantic look on his face.
The camera cuts to a far view of the canoe, which pans up as the boat moves away from it. The boat is caught in a rapid current, which is pulling it swiftly toward a jumble of large icebergs which block the end of the narrow passage formed by the towering walls of ice. Sokka paddles the boat in an attempt to stay clear of any floating chunks of ice. He manages to gain just enough speed to keep the boat from being crushed by two icebergs which slam together behind the boat. A series of shots follows: the canoe moving through the water as Sokka rows furiously; a close-up of Sokka's head; and a frontal shot of the canoe as it is nearly pinned by a number of smaller chunks of ice. Cut to Katara's face, both her face and voice full of panic as she yells commands to Sokka.",NA,"‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1

19,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Scene Description,"The shot shows an overview of the ice floes moving closer together in front of the boat, narrowing their path. The boat manages to stay clear of some of the icebergs, but it veers to the right with the current and becomes pinned by three large chunks of ice. As the canoe is completely crushed by the ice, Katara and Sokka throw themselves from the canoe and onto one of the floes; Katara nearly slides off the other side into the water, but comes to a halt at the floe's very edge. As she raises her head, looking around, the shot zooms out to reveal the siblings are floating on one floe among dozens.
Katara, shuffling on her hands and knees, moves away from the rim toward the middle of the floe, sitting next to her brother. His spear is embedded point-first in the ice just behind him.",NA,"‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1
20,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Katara,[A touch of bitterness in her voice.] You call that left?,You call that left?,"‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1

22,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Scene Description,"The shot cuts to a wide shot of the two on their floe; among the large icebergs and tiny floes surrounding them stands a massive, towering shard of ice, its craggy peak rising high above the siblings. Katara gets on her feet again, facing Sokka so that the pointed iceberg is behind her.",NA,"‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1

24,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Sokka,[Annoyed.] I knew I should've left you home!

25,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Scene Description,"Cut to a close-up of Katara's face as it contorts with fury. The shot cuts to a side view as Katara points accusingly at her brother, who makes no movement as she screams her disgust at him, the floe bobbing lightly up and down.",NA,"‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1
26,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Katara,"You are the most sexist, [She brings her hands up to her head and swings them back down and behind her in her rage; the movement creates a small wave of water behind her.] immature, [Hands raised back to her head.] nut brained ...

I'm embarrassed  to be related to you!","‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1
27,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Scene Description,"She swings both her hands back forcefully once again and her unconscious waterbending hurls a wave directly into the towering iceberg behind her; with a loud, splitting crack, a hooklike fissure arcs up its surface and out its side, leaving a spray of ice where it ends. Sokka, who wears a somewhat disinterested expression, glances briefly in his sister's direction and sees the iceberg; after a short moment, he does a double-take, his expression morphing into one of terror. The shot cuts to show Katara's outburst from behind Sokka; as she continues with her verbal outburst and arm movements, little chunks of ice from the iceberg splash into the water, unheard and unnoticed by Katara.",NA,"‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1

32,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Scene Description,"As she yells out that last word, she unconsciously waterbends once again, causing two new splits in the chunk of ice.",NA,"‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1

35,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Scene Description,"Her last movement is her most agitated and it creates a huge wave which, when it impacts the  iceberg, sends a number of fissures to snake their way up the iceberg; one of them reaches the top of the iceberg, splitting it completely in half. Petrified, Sokka gasps for air, and it is only now that Katara turns to look behind her. She gasps and the shot cuts to the iceberg; the two halves begin to fall away from each other and the siblings can be seen through the widening space between them. The shot jumps to the siblings' backs as the two halves collapse into the water; a wave larger than any Katara cast at it radiates outward toward them and they are thrown to the ice as it pushes their floe backward.
As the waves subside, the shot cuts to a head-on close-up of the siblings, their heads slightly over the edge of the ice. Sokka, holding a protective arm over Katara, turns his head toward her.",NA,"‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1

39,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Scene Description,"Several small bubbles appear on the surface of the water directly in front of them and a small spot of water begins to glow with a bright bluish hue. An overhead shot shows the spread of the brilliant glow and the bubbles within. Cut to the head-on close-up as the two siblings scramble back in renewed terror from the edge, just as a large, roughly spherical iceberg breaks the surface of the water.
The shot jumps behind Katara and Sokka as an iceberg rises above the surface, revealing its massive form to be the source of the glow. The crashing waves generated by the iceberg's rising push the floe backward as the berg itself rocks to one side, before coming to rest with its rounded dome exposed above the water. Mesmerized by the iceberg, Katara strays closer and stares at the iceberg; behind her, Sokka halfheartedly stretches out his hand, as if to hold her back. A few cuts ensue: the iceberg from behind Sokka and Katara; Katara's face as she stares at the object; and a shot of the iceberg itself, revealing a human shape within below a larger, indistinguishable mass. The human figure, perched in lotus, has glowing arrows on its head and hands. Close-up of Katara as she raises an eyebrow in confusion. The shot cuts to a closer view of the figure in the ice, its features accentuated by reflected light, revealing it to be a boy. Suddenly, the boy opens his eyes, the same brilliant light emanating from them, eliciting shocked gasps from both of the siblings.",NA,"‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1

41,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Scene Description,"Before Sokka can grab it, Katara grabs Sokka's club out of its sheath on his back and pulls her hood over her head, heading in the direction of the strange boy sealed in the iceberg. Sokka again reaches out his hand in an attempt to hold Katara back, though she is already running across the ice.",NA,"‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1

43,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Scene Description,"Katara hops across the short distance between her floe and the iceberg on five tiny chinks of ice; Sokka, close behind her, does the same. Reaching the iceberg first, Katara repeatedly strikes the iceberg with Sokka's club. On her fifth strike, the club breaks through the surface and a great gust of wind, which escapes from within the iceberg, throws her and her brother back from the side of the dome. Fissures quickly snake their way over the whole iceberg and, in a massive outward explosion, the entire orb of ice destroys itself. A beam of light bursts from the core of the iceberg and rockets into the sky. The camera shows the iceberg from the shallow sea bottom as it emits ripples of light. The scene switches to a group of tiger seals, who erect themselves to growl at the distant beam of light.
Cut to a Fire Nation ship, where a boy in a Fire Nation military uniform stands on the deck, gazing at the light. His ponytail flutters in the wind.",NA,"‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1

51,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Scene Description,"Zuko points in the direction of where the light once was. Iroh calmly continues with his game, placing another tile bearing the airbending symbol on the previous one. As he does, a gust of wind washes over him, shaking his tiles.
Cut to the iceberg, where the gale has begun to settle. Sokka had protectively clutched Katara, but he now releases her as he looks around. Light still encircles the remains of the former mountain of ice, now reduced to a hollowed-out crater. Sokka looks at his sister and they both get to their feet, Katara holding onto her brother.

53,Water,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,1,Scene Description,"Now standing atop the crater, the figure slowly erects himself and looks down at them, and the two siblings stare back in wonder and fear.
The circles of light finally dissipate as the boy stops glowing. The figure is revealed to be nothing more than a young boy, who gives a moan of exhaustion and suddenly faints. Katara gasps and runs forward to catch him before he hits the ground and Sokka begins to poke at the boy's head with the blunt end of his spear.",NA,"‎Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.1

350,Water,1,The Avatar Returns,2,Scene Description,"After a slight pause, Zuko assumes a fighting stance and fires a blast at Aang, who yells and narrowly avoids the attack. Zuko fires again, forcing Aang into the corner of the room. Cut to Aang, who pants heavily from alarm. Zuko fires once more; Aang spins around out of the corner and against the back wall. He ducks to avoid another fire blast. Cut to Zuko standing in the middle of the room, Aang managing to roll over directly behind his opponent. Aang deftly manages to stay behind Zuko, utilizing circle-walking. Zuko spins around, desperately attempting to land a blow.
The scene cuts to a shot of the deck and cabin of the ship, the window of the room where the battle is occurring illuminating two consecutive times from the fire blasts. Cut back to inside the room, where Aang uses airbending to try and deter another one of Zuko's attacks by catching his flames in a current of air. After extinguishing yet another one of his attacks, Aang uses Zuko as a stepping stone. He pushes himself off against his head and creates an air scooter in mid-air that he uses to ride around the room and over the walls and ceiling, as Zuko resumes attacking.
He avoids Zuko's repeated attacks; however, the prince manages to dissipate the air scooter by shattering it with a flame arc. Aang is smacked against the wall underneath a hanging tapestry. He quickly pushes himself up under the tapestry to avoid another fire blast. When he emerges at the top, he grabs the tapestry off its hooks and wraps it around Zuko's body, tangling him momentarily. This brief intermission gives Aang enough time to grab his glider and he turns around to face his opponent, pointing the end of the staff at Zuko, who destroys the tapestry with firebending. Zuko assumes a fighting stance, while Aang looks on with alarm. Cut to shot of the entire room, as Aang uses airbending to propel a mattress lying in a corner toward Zuko. The mattress slams into the Fire Nation prince, sending him colliding into the wall, before falling onto the mattress. Aang propels the mattress upward, sending Zuko slamming into the ceiling of the room. Aang makes a break for it before the mattress touches the ground again. Zuko and the mattress fall to the floor, and Zuko remains lying face down upon it. Cut to shot of Zuko, who raises his head and glances around the empty room, fuming.
Cut to the main control room of the ship. The wheel of the hatch located toward the back of the room begins spinning rapidly. The hatch opens with a small tornado of air and Aang emerges. Cut to a shot of the rest of the control room, a man at the helm. Cut to Aang, who leaps from the hatch and runs across the room, leaping over a table and past the man who looks up in surprise. He exits the room and runs onto the upper deck of the ship. Cut to an overhead shot of the upper deck as Aang happily spreads his arms and welcomes the fresh air. He throws his staff over the balcony which opens into a glider and begins soaring away. He appears successful until Zuko appears on screen, leaping forward, his arms extended outward. While yelling, Zuko manages to grab hold of Aang's ankle. Cut to shot of Aang, whose expression of triumph turns into one of despair as he begins losing altitude, struggling to maintain the weight of the extra, unexpected person.
The two plummet down to the lower deck of the ship and land with a crash. They bounce a few times before coming to a halt. Aang's glider closes again to a staff. Both lie on the deck for a moment. Close-up of Zuko's eyes, as they narrow in anger. Zuko begins rising, a look of persistence on his face. Aang rises and assumes a fighting stance, looking very unsure of himself. Before the fight could begin, Appa's growl distracts both fighters. Aang averts his gaze and catches sight of Appa heading toward the ship.",NA,"Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, Aaron Ehasz, Peter Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg",Dave Filoni,8.3

354,Water,1,The Avatar Returns,2,Scene Description,"He turns around to face Zuko and manages to deflect a firebending attack by spinning his glider around like a baton. However, he propels himself by accident into the air and lands on the ledge of the deck. He leans precariously over the side, unsteadily balancing himself, but manages to regain his balance only for Zuko to fire another blast at him. He twirls his glider again to deflect the attack. Two more blasts are fired his way before he loses his grip on his glider and the object spins away. The staff falls several feet away. Aang ducks, spins and leaps out of the way of blasts and lands on the very ledge, struggling to keep his balance. Zuko hurls more fire blasts his way. Aang holds up his hands in defense, but the last blast seemingly knocks him out cold and he falls backward off the ship into the water, where he slowly sinks.

However, Pakku generates it into a larger stream of water and sends it full force at her. Katara is sent back several feet. A close-up shot of her shows her bent over, breathing hard.

Katara falls roughly to the ground as Pakku lands onto the rim of a pool, bends a tower of water and manipulates the stream overhead his opponent. He deftly freezes the water into several ice shards, which he sends down at Katara. She becomes trapped in the flurry of frozen daggers and appears still for a moment.

He hops from tree root to tree root, following the fly, although unknowingly lands on the back of a catgator. He catches the fly on the last root, but lets go of it as he jumps to fly away from the creature. It pursues Momo as he flies back to Appa. The camera pans left, following the chase. When Momo and the crocodile reach Appa, the sky bison's mouth is open and the catgator swims right into it. Appa holds the creature there for a moment, before spitting it back out. Momo and the catfish crocodile hiss at each other for a moment, and the crocodile swims off. The scene cuts back to Appa, who shakes his head and loudly groans.

6431,Earth,2,The Chase,8,Scene Description,"Cuts to riverbank where the siblings embrace. Katara opens her eyes and gasps. Sokka turns around and becomes horrified. Cuts to side-view of the mongoose lizards paddling the water rapidly, allowing for them to walk over the surface of the river. Katara steps forward and spins around, sending a wave of water crashing into Ty Lee's mongoose lizard. Ty Lee leaps off the beast just in time and emerges from the water. She lands near the treetops where she gracefully dodges from tree trunk to tree trunk in pursuit of Katara, who opens her water skin.
Ty Lee somersaults onto the ground. Katara attempts to lash a water whip in her direction, however, is forced to quickly dodge several of the acrobat's blows. She narrowly avoids having her chi blocked and fires several sharp discs of water at her enemy, who cartwheels repeatedly to escape. Cuts to shot of Mai still mounted on her lizard. She turns around and fires several stilettos from uploaded holsters in her sleeves. Cuts to quick shot of the stilettos before one of Katara still fending off Ty Lee, her back to the camera.

Sokka knocks them away again with his machete. Cuts to shot of Mai, who runs forward. Cuts to view of Katara, Sokka seen in the background. Katara turns around and is forced on the run when Mai comes charging toward her. Cuts to shot of Ty Lee, who runs toward the camera.

She lands several quick blows on Sokka, using chi blocking to incapacitate Sokka's right arm. Sokka drops his boomerang as a result of this. He swings his left arm toward Ty Lee who merely incapacitates that arm, resulting in him dropping his machete. Sokka looks about him nervously and resorts to kicking his leg in order to fend off the acrobat who proceeds to render his leg useless. Sokka proceeds to use his forehead as a shield. Ty Lee strikes his skull and injures her hand in the process. She backs away and shakes her fist in pain before turning to glare at Sokka.",NA,Joshua Hamilton,Giancarlo Volpe,9

7579,Earth,2,The Drill,13,Scene Description,"Azula appears before the Avatar and a battle ensues between the two. Azula shoots fire blasts at Aang, who manages to block them using airbending. She continues the fire attacks only to have each one of her strikes deterred by water whips. She eventually manages to vaporize the water, sending Aang back. The two narrowly dodge the several boulders that are hurtled toward them at that moment. Aang uses earthbending and airbending to send rocks at Azula, who manages to avoid them all. Azula sends another powerful firebending assault that slams Aang into the Outer Wall of Ba Sing Se, leaving him unconscious.
The camera view briefly changes to where the front of the drill is seen having completely dug its way through the Outer Wall. Camera changes to Azula as she walks over to him with fire in her right hand, preparing to deal a deadly final strike, but Aang awakens and sends her skidding back using an earthbending gauntlet. A flood of slurry is released as the drill bores deeper into the wall, coating the two. Azula slides toward a helpless Aang, attempting to halt herself by windmilling only to collide with him. The force of the collision sends both sliding off opposite sides of the drill. Azula is able to stop her descent by grinding her feet into the drill's side while Momo drags Aang up to the top with the help of Aang's airbending.",NA,"Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko",Giancarlo Volpe,9

He begins sprinting toward the wall, scales up its side by riding an air scooter and, once he arrives at his highest point, rockets at lightning speed toward the bottom. As he propels himself downward, Azula catches sight of him and fires at him. She misses by mere seconds and is sent back forcefully as Aang leaps and slams down on the wedge, creating a large ripple effect.

10312,Fire,3,The Runaway,7,Scene Description,"The camera switches to the city, where Aang goes from bowing to doing tricks with the money in his hands and runs off. A few citizens are seen playing a dice like game. The two winners see Toph holding a bag of money and call her over. She tosses the two die. One lands on three, which is the highest number, and the other is about to go from three to zero. Cut to Toph, who twitches her head to the left slightly without any of the others seeing, causing the die to move back to the three, meaning she wins much to the winners' dismay and Sokka's and Aang's joy.
Cut to an area where a carnival is being hosted, where a big man tries a test-your-strength game, in which you need to use a hammer to launch a ball up to ring the bell, but can only make it about halfway. Toph jiggles a bag of money and walks over. Aang and Sokka watch from behind as she hands the man in charge of the game the money and places her hands on the hammer. She struggles to move it over her head and behind her, which makes all in the crowd snicker and laugh. Toph smiles again as she uses earthbending to launch the hammer's head from behind her to the lever with great force. The ball is launched so hard that it launches out of the game, destroying the top of it, which leaves everyone shocked. She casually grabs her winnings and leaves as the ball crashes into a tent behind, causing everyone to cringe at the sound, and looks back to see the damage.
The camera next cuts to a street where a carriage is being pulled by a dragon moose. Cut to a side-shot of the inside of the carriage where a noble opens his cup of tea to his delight and waves the aroma to his face. Toph emerges from a dark alley and creates a small rock right in front of one of the wheels to stop the cart. She falls back, pretending to have been hit. The noble peeks outside the carriage window and sees Toph. He jumps out of the carriage and starts to run, but is stopped by what looks like a Fire Nation guard, who is really Sokka in his Wang Fire costume. He notices Toph being ""run over"" and crosses his arms angrily at the noble, who gets on his knees and begs Sokka. He places twelve small bags of money as bribery, one after another in Sokka's arms, and Sokka smiles and winks at him to assure him that Sokka will keep this secret.

Zuko brings his hands up and jumps forward, bringing his arms down in front of him. He bends a flame in each hand and they emerge. He sends the fire toward Azula. The scene cuts to the side of the fight to show a wall of fire, blue colliding with red, take form. As the wall begins to die, Azula leaps up on a jet of fire and kicks her legs forward, sending a wave of fire from her feet during each of her three spinning kicks.
Cut to an overhead shot of the stone pillars. Aang lands on top of one, but suddenly leaps away to be blocking and pushed by a blast of fire emerging from Ozai. The Fire Lord attacks again, sending a wave of fire from a downward kick. Aang jumps to another rock to avoid the attack, and picks up a small part of the rock and sends it toward Ozai with a kick. Ozai dodges the attack by sending a blast of fire out of his foot. Aang leaps to the top of another rock to avoid the attack before leaping to land near a waterfall. Ozai follows him there, sending yet another fire blast toward Aang. Aang uses waterbending to send some of the waterfall toward the flames, extinguishing them and causing Ozai to jump back. He flies back toward Aang, using fire rockets from his feet. He shoots a large burst of fire at Aang, but Aang jumps to the top of the waterfall to avoid the attack. Ozai rockets up after him, and flips forward, shooting fire from both feet. Aang jumps to the other side of the slope to escape the hot flames.
Ozai flies over to him, using his fire jets shooting from his feet, but Aang lands on a boulder, lifting it into the air. He jumps away, only to stop Ozai for a second, distracted by the boulder. He continues to chase Aang, shooting at him with his fiery fist. Aang spins around, creating a tornado shield that blocks him from the flames. He lands on the side of a rock pillar, and quickly scoots to the other side, only to see Ozai shooting another stream of fire at him. Aang leaps to another pillar before airbending himself back to the first pillar. He kicks the top of the pillar off, sending it toward Ozai. To Aang's surprise, Ozai is right behind him, and he sends a ball of fire toward Aang.
Aang raises his hand to block himself from the surprise attack as he is pushed and hits the side of a rock, falling to the ground in pain. Ozai flies toward him again, and lands on the same ledge as Aang. Seeing that Ozai is there, Aang picks himself up, and suddenly earthbends to create rock armor around his body. Ozai shoots fists of fire at Aang, pushing him around the edge of the ledge. He swings his arm at Aang, sending a wave of fire toward him, but he jumps away leaving the rock armor behind.
Aang suddenly performs a flip backward to shoot a gust of wind at Ozai from the air. Ozai jumps aside to avoid Aang's blast, and begins to shoot lightning. Aang is grasping on to the side of a rock, seemingly terrified. Just when the lightning is about to strike him, he quickly swings his arm around to create another tornado shield. He jumps up, and flies to the top of a rock where Ozai attempts to shoot a lightning bolt at him, but misses. After the failed attempt, he continues shooting blasts at Aang, to which he lifts the top of a rock and dodges in order to evade. He suddenly rolls forward, just as Ozai sends another blast of lightning toward him.
Aang begins to redirect the lightning, pointing it toward the terrified Ozai. Aang hesitates to strike him, and so he sends the bolt into the orange sky instead. He falls to the ground, exhausted from straining to hold the energy from the lightning. Ozai smiles, sensing he has the upper-hand, and performs a spin-kick of fire toward Aang, who raises the ground to protect himself from the fire blast. He is thrown off the rock from the impact and is falling toward the water below him. The camera zooms in on his eye as he opens it and realizes he is falling.
He tilts himself up, frantically waving his arms and trying to airbend to break his fall. Seeing that does not work due to the speed he is falling, as he nears the water, he creates a funnel shape from it to land softly and gets washed up onto shore. He quickly stands up to see Ozai rocketing toward him. Cut to a shot of Ozai.",NA,"Aaron Ehasz, Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko",Joaquim Dos Santos,9.8

He turns his foot around in order to steady himself. Cut to a frontal shot of Zuko, a powerful fire blast streaming from his fist.
Suddenly, Zuko and Azula stop their attacks. The scared and confused Azula turns to find that Zuko's strong attack has caused the plaza behind her to be smothered in flames.

Zuko quickly defends himself by creating a shield of fire for protection. He tries to attack Azula, who is still circling him, but she is too fast. The scene cuts to a close shot of Zuko. He stops firing at Azula, crouches, and begins spinning and kicking immense and powerful flames from his feet. Azula is flying forward; when she sees the attack, she tries to stop, but it is too late. Azula falls and rolls forward onto the ground. In pain, she picks herself up.
