# Broadway Weekly Grosses

Huge thanks to [Alex Cookson](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues/200) who provided ALL of this week's data, cleaning script, and readme!

Check out his recent [blog post](https://www.alexcookson.com/post/most-successful-broadway-show-of-all-time/) on the same data.

This data comes from [Playbill](https://www.playbill.com/grosses). Weekly box office grosses comprise data on revenue and attendance figures for theatres that are part of [The Broadway League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Broadway_League), an industry association for, you guessed it, Broadway theatre.

CPI data is from the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/). There are many, *many* measures of CPI, so the one used here is "All items less food and energy in U.S. city average, all urban consumers, seasonally adjusted" (table [CUSR0000SA0L1E](https://beta.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/CUSR0000SA0L1E)).

Check out all of the raw data and other details on [Alex's GitHub](https://github.com/tacookson/data/tree/master/broadway-grosses)
