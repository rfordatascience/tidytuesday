Pour Kahlua into shot glass to about 1/2 full. 2. Using a spoon(inverted), slowly pour in the Peppermint Schnapps until glass is about 3/4 full. Done correctly, the Schnapps will flow under the Kahlua for a clear layer. 3. Again using a spoon, but this time right side up, slowly top off the glass with a layer of Bailey's. Be careful to place the spoon right at the top of the Kahlua layer and to raise it as the glass fills up. Done correctly, this will provide a layer of Bailey's floating over the Kahlua. 4. Toss it down all at once for something like a Peppermint Pattie, WITH A BANG!!! NOTE: Best if all ingredients are chilled","

The second step is to fill half the glass with ice and add one or two shooter glasses full of high quality Tequila. The next stage is to add the flavouring elements. This is done by squeezing a fresh lime into the glass, adding a few grains of salt, adding citrus-flavoured soda pop, until the glass is 4/5 full, and then adding spicy Viuda de Sanchez (or orange juice, lime juice and pico de gallo).
