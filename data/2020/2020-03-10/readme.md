# College tuition, diversity, and pay

College tuition data is somewhat difficult to find - with many sites limiting it to online tools.

The data this week comes from many different sources but originally came from the US Department of Education. The most comprehensive and easily accessible data cames from [Tuitiontracker.org](https://www.tuitiontracker.org/) who allows for a .csv download! Unfortunately it's in a very wide format that is not ready for analysis, but `tidyr` can make quick work of that with `pivot_longer()`. It has a massive amount of data, I have filtered it down to a few tables as seen in the attached .csv files. Tuition and diversity data can be quickly joined by `dplyr::left_join(tuition_cost, diversity_school, by = c("name", "state"))`. Some of the other tables can also be joined but there may be some fuzzy matching needed.

Historical averages from the [NCES](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76) - cover 1985-2016.

*Tuition and fees* by college/university for 2018-2019, along with school type, degree length, state, in-state vs out-of-state from the [Chronicle of Higher Education](https://www.chronicle.com/interactives/tuition-and-fees).

*Diversity* by college/university for 2014, along with school type, degree length, state, in-state vs out-of-state from the [Chronicle of Higher Education](https://www.chronicle.com/interactives/student-diversity-2016).

Example diversity graphics from [Priceonomics](https://priceonomics.com/ranking-the-most-and-least-diverse-colleges-in/).

Average net cost by income bracket from [TuitionTracker.org](https://www.tuitiontracker.org/).

Example price trend and graduation rates from [TuitionTracker.org](https://www.tuitiontracker.org/school.html?unitid=228778)

Salary potential data comes from [payscale.com](https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/best-schools-by-state/bachelors/new-hampshire).
