The Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante) revealed that TIM was fined due to numerous unlawful data processing activities related to marketing and advertising, which included unsolicited promotional calls and prize competitions in which data subjects were entered without consent.One of the reasons for the large fine was the fact that the unlawful data processing activities involved several million individuals. One individual, for example, was called a total of 155 times in a month while TIM refused to add the affected individual on a no-call list even after several requests. The DPA determined that the company lacked control over the call centers and did not have adequate measures to add people to no-call lists.TIM also did not provide accurate and detailed enough privacy policies and data processing policies, and as such consumers were not efficiently informed about the data collected and processed. The company&#8217;s management of data breaches was also not efficient according to Garante.Besides the fine, Garante also imposed 20 corrective measures according to Art. 58(2) GDPR which prohibits TIM from processing marketing-related data of those individuals who have refused to receive promotional calls, individuals who asked to be blacklisted and individuals who are not clients of TIM.The company was also forbidden from using customer data collected from the &#8220;My Tim&#8221;, &#8220;Tim Personal&#8221; and &#8220;Tim Smart Kid&#8221; apps.

Facebook argued that it did in fact appoint a data protection officer in Ireland who acted as a data protection officer for all the local European Facebook branches. The Data Protection Authority of Hamburg, however, argued that Facebook did not notify the German authority about this appointment, and as such, the fine is valid. The reason the fine was relatively small was that Facebook did, after all, appoint a DPO but failed to notify German authorities. The fine was given to Facebook Germany GmbH, which is the local German branch of the company.The fine was issued sometimes in 2019 but was only made public by the Data Protection Authority of Hamburg in February 2020. The exact date of the fine was not revealed.

The Authority also questioned Google&#8217;s practice of informing website owners about which search results Google had removed, specifically which link (search result) has been removed and who was behind the removal request.
