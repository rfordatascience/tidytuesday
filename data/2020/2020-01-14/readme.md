# Passwords

This week's data is all about passwords. Data is sourced from [Information is Beautiful](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cz7TDhm0ebVpySqbTvrHrD3WpxeyE4hLZtifWSnoNTQ/edit#gid=21), with the graphic coming from the same group [here](https://twitter.com/infobeautiful/status/1216765612439019521?s=20).

There's lots of additional information about password quality & strength in the source [Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cz7TDhm0ebVpySqbTvrHrD3WpxeyE4hLZtifWSnoNTQ/edit#gid=21). Please note that the "strength" column in this dataset is relative to these common aka "bad" passwords and YOU SHOULDN'T USE ANY OF THEM!

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength) has a nice article on password strength as well.
