# The Office - Words and Numbers 

The data this week comes from the [`schrute` R package](https://bradlindblad.github.io/schrute/index.html) for The Office transcripts and [data.world](https://data.world/anujjain7/the-office-imdb-ratings-dataset) for IMDB ratings of each episode.

If you'd like to use the `schrute` R package for ALL the lines/dialogue from the show - please install it from CRAN via `install.packages("schrute")`. A quick example from the vignette can be found [here](https://bradlindblad.github.io/schrute/articles/theoffice.html).

If you want to do text analysis - make sure to check out the `tidytext` package - a vignette can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/vignettes/tidytext.html) and the *Tidy Text Mining with R* book can be found freely online [here](https://www.tidytextmining.com/). 

Lastly - the pudding analyzed *The Office* dialogue across a few charts - their article is [here](https://pudding.cool/2017/08/the-office/).
