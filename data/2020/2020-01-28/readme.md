# San Francisco Trees

The data this week comes from San Francisco's [open data portal](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Street-Tree-List/tkzw-k3nq).

There are dozens of tree species, and many other intresting features to explore in this dataset! I did drop a few columns that were either > 75% missing or redundant, feel free to check out the source for the fully original dataset.

Also - make sure to follow [@tidypod](https://twitter.com/tidypod) - they'll have some interesting `#TidyTuesday` updates to come this week!

Some interesting articles:
- [Trees of Life in SF](https://www.sfweekly.com/news/feature/trees-of-life/)

```{r}
# Get the Data

sf_trees <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-01-28/sf_trees.csv')

# Or read in with tidytuesdayR package (https://github.com/thebioengineer/tidytuesdayR)
# PLEASE NOTE TO USE 2020 DATA YOU NEED TO UPDATE tidytuesdayR from GitHub

# Either ISO-8601 date or year/week works!

# Install via devtools::install_github("thebioengineer/tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-01-28') 
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, week = 5)

### Data Dictionary

# `sf_trees.csv`

A full data dictionary is available at: [the source](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Street-Tree-List/tkzw-k3nq) but it's fairly sparse.

|variable     |class     |description |
|:------------|:---------|:-----------|
|tree_id      |double    | Unique ID |
|legal_status |character | LegalLegal staus: Permitted or DPW maintained |
|species      |character | Tree species includes common name after the :: separator |
|address      |character | Street Address |
|site_order   |double    | Order of tree at address where multiple trees are at same address. Trees are ordered in ascending
address order |
|site_info    |character | Site Info - Where the tree resides |
|caretaker    |character | Agency or person that is primary caregiver to tree -- Owner of Tree |
|date         |double    | Date Planted (NA if before 1955)|
|dbh          |double    | [Diameter at breast height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter_at_breast_height) |
|plot_size    |character | Dimension of plot - typically in feet |
