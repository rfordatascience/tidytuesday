You miss out on so much that only the 1st player gets in terms of activities, resources, etc. It's absolutely terrible. You have to buy a 2nd console if more than one person in your household wants to get the full game experience. That's unacceptable.	2020-03-20

You can fish and catch bugs, but only as long as they're on the same screen as the primary player (they are often much more spread out so there is only one at a time on the screen)The only saving grace is the fact that you can switch who the primary is by simply shaking the controllers. Otherwise this installment of animal crossing is vastly improved from the previous games, with better visuals, customisation and more quality of life improvements than i can count. In older animal crossing games i only found a couple hours of things to do per day, in New horizons there seems to be a plethora of activities to take part in with new activities opening up the more i play. The new ability to Terraform the landscape and really shape the island to my liking is a more than welcome addition and makes me feel like I'm really starting a little town of my very own! If you are playing on your own, you won't be able to find a better animal crossing experience! If you are buying this to play with a friend, however, just keep the limitations of couch co-op in mind before you buy.

This creates a slower paced game and allows you as a player to take your time and let your little island grow organically with every decision you make. There are some complaining about island sharing with others on the same console but the fact is it makes the game better. Islands are sizable so there is plenty of space for everyone but most importantly this is a social game and multiple residents makes it easier to harvest and share resources which is ESSENTIAL to progression. All in all a wonderful game and highly recommended.… Expand	2020-03-20

Because they were willing to add variety of words when they talk, it seems enjoyable and natural to go talk with different characters in the game. However, there are downsides. You might have only one island per console, which means you cannot have multiple islands in the game. Besides, the incapable of not supporting cloud-saves. It needs to be supported, so people won’t get their internal data lost. Although, the game fully meets expectations with a good gameplay in which it is intended for hardcore audiences.

My wife has about 8 hours in the game, I have about 6.Sharing an Island thoughts:So far we both find it excellent and have had no issues with sharing an Island.  I should qualify the review by stating that I played the GameCube version extensively and put some 80 hours into the 3DS version so I haven't played all iterations of the game.  Still, I have no issues with two people sharing an island as long as the primary player initiates it so player 2, 3 and 4 aren't held back.I always enjoyed the shared experiences of animal crossing.  How one player would teach the computer characters specific words.  You and your siblings arguing over who ran over all the flowers.  Competing to get rare fossils first.  To me that was the fun of the game.  Personally, I think so long as you aren't a control freak this is more fun forcing multiple players into a shared space.Actual Game Review:I love it.  To anyone who has played the game before this is a natural progression.  If you feel you are ready for a new instalment it appears to have everything you would want.  If you haven't played before you need to be prepared for what the actual game is.  Professional reviews would describe it more articulately but it is a basic communication game.  This may sound like one of those mobile games where you have to play every few hours to harvest stuff and trade things but the design predates that genre by several years.  Animal Crossing is a game where you basically hang out on an island with NPC's who you chat with and just hang out.  They are like virtual friends.  They learn your speech and are happy to see you.  You gradually develop the island by changing the landscape and adding little customizations all around.  These are all small almost mindless tasks but it gives you a felling of touching up your home.  You can also visit friends islands which is much easier in the modern age of the internet than it use to be.  It is all fun in a passive sort of way.  The game is ideally played for around 15 to 30 min a day every day for years.  You do a few tasks and watch how the world changes with the seasons and holidays.  Slowly collecting things and changing the world.  I imagine some of the negative reviews are people trying to marathon the game because they are stuck inside due to the virus outbreak.  You can play for hours a day but that probably isn't the best way to enjoy things as the game clock is part of what drives progress.  If these things sound pleasant and fun you might like it.  Animal Crossing really is an acquired taste but I am happy to say that the format still has life left in it after all these years.… Expand	2020-03-21

10	Munchie03	By far one of the most charming games of 2020. The game offers a variety of tasks and adventure to explore with its new deserted island theme. The DIY crafting mechanic allows you to build new items instead of buying them like in past game and offers new uses for existing material on your island. The characters are charming and have unique personalities that keep the game refreshing.	2020-03-21

Furthermore the game is designed to give the person who initially creates the island far more agency than players who join afterwards (naming the town, doing initial town building quests). Additionally the game does not account for multiple people being on the island and always generates the same amount of resources per day, meaning anyone that plays after someone else is liable to not find any wood, stone or fruit until the next literal day of the week. All of this combines to make the local multiplayer experience terrible. All other games on the switch allow for different user profiles to create new save files, why is this not the case for Animal Crossing?

She doesn't play much, so I was thrilled when Animal Crossing was announced because it looks like her type of game. Fast forward to me learning about the island, and I expressed my concerns to her. She said to me that it would be okay and we would just share. To my dismay, sharing is not an option. Only the primary player can progress the game. Any big progression moments must be done only by the one player. Any additional players just have to exist and not partake in progression. That is evil. This is the worst thing I've seen from Nintendo. I played for two hours and decided to stop and let my girlfriend play. Again, I couldn't believe how terribly the second player is treated. No new resources spawn for each player. I only played for two hours and it was enough for it to be impossible for her to progress in any capacity. She has now decided she will never play again because she tried to play but wasn't able to since she hit a complete brick wall after ten minutes. We tried to figure it out on the second day, and ultimately this game is not compatible with multiple players. If you are the only person on the switch, this game is great. If you have anyone else at all who playsthe console, the game does not work. I'm giving this a 0/10 because of how disappointed and sad my girlfriend is.

If you wanted multiple villagers, the second wasn’t mayor and didn’t have as much freedom. So I would say that this isn’t a step back, but rather a lack of step forward from the developers on that front. However I don’t believe that this condemns all the amazing other features and steps forward. All furniture has been remodelled with great details, textures and lighting effects for a game with such a simplistic artistic direction. The museum is sublime, and the hourly music is memorable (for some). Animals now do lots of activities too and feel more alive than ever with witty and varied dialogue. Crafting is simple but well implemented, and it is a pleasure to slowly build the island into the little village the previous games had gotten us used to. I am ready to take off two points for the limitations created for families/friends with one console, though it does not concern me personally, but that does not entirely condemn it for all the wonderful things it has to offer and the great effort that was put into designing the game.

But I just can't understand all the 0/10, especially the ones saying it's like a HD New Leaf.Are we playing the same game? I've spend my last three days around my island in a 4K monitor and I think it's one of the prettiest games I've ever played. Every franchise has its style, you can't make this game with the details of Red Dead Redemption 2 because you could destroy what AC means: simple but cool relaxing folky ambients to spend your life on. New Horizons maintains the style of the saga with new and more detailed than ever graphics, amazing lightning and weather effects and the perfect acoustic soundtrack for a walk in the woods (plus a lot of new and reinvented features that combine very well with that deserted island in modern days feel of everything).It came out a few days ago and I don't get why some people are asking for big things at the very beginning of a game that's supposed to be played day by day for a very long time. In the third day around the island I had sooooo many things to do I really didn't know where to start. The way you can decorate everything step by step, and the way you feel when you finally unlock every little feature... I think it's the best AC ever made, or at least one of the great ones. And for all the missing characters and features for the fans like Brewster or the gyroids it's all coming soon with free updates.Maybe you're new and you were looking for a different experience, maybe you really didn't know it was limited to one island (which is a very bad point but it's not something Nintendo has tried to hide with this and any other past Animal Crossing game), or idk, maybe you want a Grand Theft Animal...

Population: Growing had only one town per memory card. Wild World only had one town per cartridge. City Folk had only one town per system. And New Leaf had only one town per cartridge. Out of all the negative reviews on this site (142 at the time of this review), only about 20-30 of them have actual valid criticisms about the game.Now enough of that.This game is honestly a wonder to play, its truly amazing how unique and fun it is and is definitely a step up from its predecessors. The graphics and sound are phenomenal. The game play is amazing. The way the game just manages to just completely soothe you and take you away from your surroundings is completely mind boggling. It's almost like the game hypnotizes you, keeping you completely focused on whats going on in the game.The only reason I don't rate this a 10 is because some of the loading times do get rather excessive (40 seconds to load up the mailbox, however this was on only one occasion and I believe it was an isolated incident). Some of the progression is really weird and it took me a second to actually figure out what to do and unlock all the tools and whatnot. I am mildly disappointed that they don't let you explore the entirety of the island right away but I actually believe its necessary to help teach new players how to play the game before completely letting go of their hands and leaving them free to their devices. Also I do agree that the couch co-op does kinda suck in that its incredibly limiting for player 2. Don't listen to the 1 Island per Switch people, imo it isn't really a valid reason for rating the game a 0 out of 10 since its always been this way. Hope this helps!… Expand	2020-03-22

Having only one island per console is something Nintendo has done for all previous Animal Crossing games in some form.AC for GC: *only 1 town per memory card*AC for DS: *only 1 town per game*AC for Wii: *only 1 town per system*AC for 3DS: *only 1 town per game/system*AC for Switch: *only 1 island per system*The only difference was the way that each device handled save files. So yes, it sometimes had some benefits to how it handled them but that isn't the point. The point is that Nintendo always wanted people to play together in one town. It has nothing to do with something like Nintendo forcing you to buy more consoles. People, please. Use your brain... You also couldn't move the save file from the Wii to an SD card. People never complained about those issues so obviously Nintendo didn't see the need to change it. So why is it now all of a sudden that surprising to everyone?And about the thing that only the founder of the island can make progression: That only applies to the story progression like building the museum etc. After the first week (if you do everything in that pace) everyone can do everything (more or less, I'm not that far yet so I cannot guarantee it, I just read it in a review. But nobody else, especially the people complaining, seem to have done some research before complaining about it, since I don't believe that you are that far in the game yet that you can even know that much about the game.Coop is completely knew to this game and in previous games if other players wanted to have a turn, they had to wait until the other person finished theirs. Now you can play together at the same time. Yes, I also would have liked to play in split screen so that's a negative point I would give. But 0 points for those things is just dumb.Don't get me wrong, I also would like for people to be able to have their own island if they choose to but the way people are acting here is just stupid. It's not greed, it's not Nintendo trying to force us buying more consoles. It's just Nintendo asking us to play together on one island, sharing and caring for each other. You can like it or dislike it. I understand going down with your personal score, yes. But going down to 0 is just pure hate from you being angry that devs don't make YOUR perfect game.

In theory, sharing an island works, and many games have succeeded in this. The resources most definitely should be independent per player so that everyone has stuff they can do, the fact that it doesn't literally makes the game unplayable in large households and families that share a switch because one player will perform all of the activities, filling their NookMiles, leaving nothing left for anyone else to do. Sharing an island at all should be a choice, and the game itself should be designed around sharing, with safeguards allowing every player to fully enjoy the game. At present this is far from the case and it leaves an extremely poor play experience for player 2's and even Players 1's to a certain extent. Unless this is changed, the game is worthless to me and many others, therefore I can't give any score other than 0.And to anyone saying that people giving negative reviews over a single, minor feature/complaint, and are trying to counterbalance the score to drown out the whiners, remember that the people reviewing these low scores literally cannot experience the game that you are giving 10's for because of this problem.… Expand	2020-03-22

Multiple game saves do exist.  The Nintendo Switch do have on board memory and a SD card slot for extra storage. No worries it can handle it!Nintendo have designed Animal crossing this way.  They did this on purpose to force people to buy hardware and a second copy of the game. shameful. Other than that is is a great game, too bad its not equal for everyone.Here's how the game should work with a single switch : Johnny signs in with his Nintendo profile,  Plays Animal Crossing,  does his tasks and game progression.  once done Jane signs in with her profile, Plays Animal Crossing, does her tasks and game progression.Want to play on the same island together? no problem,  Choose which Island you want to play on and  when the 2nd player visits they can take some resources with them to share. Both can continue to play together and farm resources that they can keep or trade.

Veterans of the animal crossing franchise fans will most likely appreciate all these new addition to the games.The games does everything right in term of the gameplay but it does have some cons to it as well. Nintendo have set restriction where you only can have one island on a switch which means that you can't have multiple islands on the same console.

As a long time fan I can say this is a very faithful and innovative title in the series. The big pros introduced in this game that I see clearly are the introduction of crafting, innovations to both indoor decorating and new outdoor decoration, and freedom to build your town how you like it with the moment of buildings introduced. There are many other pros too, such as character customization, the beauty of the game (especially seen in the museum), etc. However, the game does have flaws. The tool degradation feels like complete annoyance rather than sense of progression and challenge it should, which is only worsened by the crafting system lacking depth due to the only 8 or so crafting  materials ever used. This makes it feel very monotonous to craft things, as it would require more resources than your small island can provide, which leads you to go to other islands (Using Nook Ticket) to get resources, which can become very tedious and somewhat too easy after your first few times. The game’s pacing feels extremely slow compared to other Animal Crossing games, which does hurt when you are so limited in the beginning. Other criticisms such as it lacking gyroids (present since AC:Population Growing) being missing, a somewhat lacking roster of new villagers, fish and bugs feeling too easy to catch now, and the dreaded 1 island per console issue do bring the game down however. One criticism I don’t believe is valid is the introduction of holidays through updates, as they would be added by the time normal players would get there thus the only people who would complain is the time travelers, which is debatable if that’s cheating or not. Overall, I believe this is a great evolution of the animal crossing formula, with many small flaws that are common across franchises when such a large gap is between entries which is to be expected. I would recommend this game to any previous Animal Crossing fan and anyone wanting to come into the franchise for the first time.… Expand	2020-03-23

Only the first player to start the game gets to experience the whole game, complete with building shops, completing tasks for Nook, moving buildings, unlocking recipes, and generally continuing the storyline. Everyone else does not even get to help donate resources to building projects so their ability to progress in the game is limited by how much the primary player has unlocked. Nintendo is basically trying to force households to buy multiple consoles and multiple copies of the game as that is the only way for everyone to get the full experience!The island also does not have enough resources to go around when you have to share those resources with everyone else in your household who plays the game. It can easily create tension and arguments as players fight over the valuable resources like iron that are in limited supply but are needed for crafting.

Also, you shouldn't disregard the rest of the entire game and give it a 0 for one reason, you should still base your review on the other parts of the game, too.As for my review, I obviously can't say how good the entire game is based on my 3 days (unless I time travel), but it's been amazing from what I play. There's just so much to do, and I never find myself feeling like I did all I could for the day. There are also so many things that make the quality of life so much better. Some of these are simple things, like items automatically stacking or bells automatically going into your wallet, but there are also larger changes like the tool wheel. The game is also a lot easier to play for longer periods of time compared to New Leaf because it's not on a tiny 480p screen (not to discredit New Leaf, that is also a great game). Overall, I can't say how good the full game is, but I can definitely give it a 10 based on the 3 days I've played through.… Expand	2020-03-23

That helps with not missing out on the story beats, but expect all but the leader player to be little more than a glorified spectator. Follower players cannot talk to villagers, access their inventory, pick things up without a long animation for each item, choose where to go, enter/exit buildings, use the tool belt, and worst of all: only the leader will receive any of the quest rewards or world drops.The game still gets a two star from as I'm sure playing as the primary or sole player is still very fun.

So sad I wasted 400euro on a console that performs worse than an iPhone and with barely any games on it.Edit update: I sold the switch for 430eur so no loss. The game is SEVERELY limited and bottle necked by the Switch's terrible hardware. Load screens inside load screens lmfao. Got a new room in your house? Nice load screen, so sad. Hit boxes are so huge you feel like playing Minecraft. Place a lamp and you can't walk around for 1 meter lol...

There is also the fact that parts of your island are completely locked because you don't have any bridges built at the start unlike other games, and it's a while before you build bridges or unlock the vaulting pole. Nintendo also shows their greed in wanting you to buy more Switch consoles, as it is not 1 island per Nintendo Switch user, it's 1 island per Nintendo Switch console. And the only way to get a new or second island is to delete your first. This game also excludes the character of the fan favorite and my personal favorite, Rover. He does not appear on the plane to the island to help you (instead that role is filled by Nook's little scouts), and he doesn't appear in the game at all. My only things to say in defense of this game is that for once the game lets you decide what your villager's appearance is instead of generating it with cryptic questions like the other games (and usually no matter what you answered for the questions, you didn't like how your villager looked). The other thing is that Tom Nook appears to be less greedy and more friendly. He has general interactions the way a peppy villager, or Isabelle, or one of the Ables would instead of constant badgering and pressuring you about money like he does in other games.… Expand	2020-03-24

The new crafting system also keeps me coming back to collect more materials. Even with all of this, there's one huge issue that cannot be ignored that many others have complained about.Animal Crossing fails the most at co-op. The fact that you can only have one island per Switch seems greedy, so that customers go out to buy more switches. Even if you buy another copy of the game, it won't give you another island. That means me and my siblings are forced to live on one island. The leader and follower system can very annoying to deal with, especially if you really want to get things done on your island. The leader retains all of the abilities a regular player would have, but the followers are basically glorified NPCs. The followers can't access their inventory or interact with other residents. Followers can only use their tools and pick things up. When they do pick something up, it goes straight to the recycling bin, for the leader to potentially steal, or for a drawn out sequence where the players have to switch between leaders. It doesn't help that sometimes my siblings sometimes try to cuck me and steal my resources to sell, or for one of them to steal leader from me. It's also annoying that you can shake your controller to change leader. My siblings just shake my hands and steal leader. I'd really like an option to turn that off. I don't get why they locked these features to just one player. It really waters down the experience for me who was excited, since I'll be playing mostly co-op with my siblings.The biggest flaw with co-op play, the thing that really kills the experience for me, has to be the Island Representative system. There can only be one Island Representative, the person who first opens the game. They are also the only person who is able to progress the story, along with other exclusive benefits like exclusive DIY recipes. That would be fine if there was multiple save files, but the problem is there isn't. The other players that live on the island just have have a way worse experience. I'm not saying it's not fun to play as a villager, I'm just saying you're not getting the full experience. It can still be fun to decorate your house and to complete daily tasks.I think this game is at its best when playing single-player. Co-op at the moment is terrible and not having extra saves can ruin the experience for many. Also, please keep in mind I don't have access to a single-player save. I'd recommend this game to people to people who have Switches that only they use. This game just isn't made for multiple people to with.

This game is everything I was hoping the first console release since the Wii to be. It takes everything great from the series and expands on it. I admit that as a fan I was bit bogged down by the 3DS New Leaf. It made the game feel more like work and a job to me instead of the laid back relaxing life I was used to in the past titles. However New Horizons makes it just feel like part of the everyday activities. I was afraid of the additions from the mobile game ruining the usual experience as well, but they implemented it in such a way as it just feels like an option and not a requirement to craft at all. Though it does make it nice to have both options when you're low on money OR low on supplies you always have a way to get the tools you need! The airport is an awesome addition as well as it's used for your travel between friends' towns as well as getting to use Nook tickets to visit islands that have more recources than your own! Especially if you play solo. You get the benefits of visiting a friend's island without needing a friend for it! All of the people bashing this game over the shared island when having more than one account on the same system....that's part of the series's charm. You always share an island in every version on the consoles. If you want it to be like on the DS or 3DS you can always get separate Nintendo Switches and have your own islands JUST like on those versions. The fact that you can play locally on the same system at the same time together is a HUGE add to multiplayer and I think they've done so many great things in this version. I also think that the addition of building up to getting the musuem and other buildings in this version is done in a very satisfying way where you don't have everything right away like the old ones (so you feel like there is something to work toward) but it doesn't feel like a chore or a job like in New Leaf. As someone who was a bit disappointed with New Leaf, I love this new one and am excited as I grow my new animal home! See you on that island life, neighbors!… Expand	2020-03-24

New Horizons gives a stronger, better sense of progression and accomplishment than any previous Animal Crossing game. While the player character essentially starts from scratch on a deserted island, there is no shortage of things to do even within the first week. Villagers are as charismatic as ever, and the catalogue of fish and bugs to catch, fossils to discover, items to craft, and Nookmiles rewards to earn is astounding. Only a few days in, my wife and I have had multiple chance-encounters with special NPCs that add a sense of intrigue and wonder to the game. As a cherry on top, the game is also beautiful; the aesthetics, soundtrack, and sound-design make for a soothing and satisfying experience.I personally think the co-op play is great. My wife and I inhabiting the same island is not an issue, and in fact we enjoy working together and surprising one another with our creative ideas and discoveries. While it would be nice if we both had all the freedoms that the leader position offers at once, it is so quick and easy to switch leaders that we have no problem tag-teaming whatever we're working on. If I could ask for one thing, I would a split-screen co-op feature. However, the current system serves well in its own rite.I'm very excited to continue playing New Horizons, developing our island, and making new discoveries. I appreciate the hard work that's gone into this game, and I'm thankful in advance for the content updates that will continue to make this game an exciting and enjoyable experience. Thanks, Nintendo!… Expand	2020-03-24

This function needs to be fixed as the game at this point is BROKEN, and is very disappointing for the following types of demographics: Couples who share a switch, siblings who share a switch, a parent and a child who want to play together, Roommates who all pitched in to buy a switch together.... you get my point.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a FANTASTIC single player experience and is the best game in the installment by far. The game is charming as always and the new crafting mechanic adds so much to the game as a whole. Now, instead of catching bugs, fishing, and gathering fruit to sell to buy items, you can make your own tools and furniture. Another great addition this game has is the deserted islands you can visit. You are allowed to visit small, deserted islands and gather as many resources there as you can hold to bring back to your island. This helps lower the time it takes to gather enough resources to build a new building or upgrade an old one. Nook Miles is a new addition as well - a currency that you get just by doing things like catching bugs, chopping down trees, and selling items for bells! This makes doing simple little things rewarded. Nook Miles Plus allows you to do simple tasks like catch 5 bugs and then adds a new one right away for you to complete. Here's the main issue with the game - for each copy of Animal Crossing you own, you can only have ONE ISLAND. This would be fine if it were just yourself playing, but other players can't have their own experience AND can't do a lot of things in the game if they don't own the island. Even if you have 2 Nintendo Switches, you can only have one island per copy of Animal Crossing you own. This makes the game so much less enjoyable for other players for no reason - Nintendo could have EASILY allowed for multiple saves. In addition to that, islands can't bew recovered via Nintendo Switch Online which was a major selling point of NSO - backups. Nintendo will recover your island up to one time if you get a new system or break your old one, but after that, you are on your own. I wish Nintendo would fix these issues, because if they did, this game would be nearly perfect. Still, if you don't plan on breaking your Switch and aren't playing with anyone else, I can't reccomend this game enough.… Expand	2020-03-24

New Horizons delivers almost everything that was promised but pulls its hand back on one feature- multiplayer. While the limitation of one island per Switch was announced prior to launch the limitations forced on players not the island representative. All progress on the island, such as crafting recipes, buildings, and public works are locked behind the first person to play the game on a system. Secondary players likewise do not receive anything from progressing the game's 'story' such as awarded crafting recipes, items, money, or any unique character dialogue or cutscenes tied to them, such as when completing the museum or town hall. Local multiplayer is likewise gutted, with the camera, inventory, and NPC interaction being tied exclusively to the session's leader. Online multiplayer is not much better, being essentially the same as New Leaf's without its mini-game island or any equivalent, which was a good portion of the online content for that game. These make for an extremely underwhelming and downright frustrating multiplayer experience that is difficult for even the most easily entertained to enjoy, which is particularly upsetting as the game, at its core, is extremely fun and almost everything you could hope for from an Animal Crossing game.I have my doubts Nintendo will address this issue. They have ignored other key product issues, such as Joy-Cons drifting and poor online services, to burying their head in the sand and hoping it'll blow over. I sincerely hope that they are not successful in skirting responsibility on this one- this is a decision made out of pure greed to sell more Switch systems, that thankfully, could not have been made at a worse time.

I expected the peace and tranquility of my own island, and the fun of sharing that island with *visitors*, hoping my housemates would start their own islands on our shared switch. The second day with this game I learned that is not an option. Not only are my housemates forced to share the same island with me, the resources on my island are shared between all of us.  Anybody can move anything outside of their houses anywhere on the island. Playing local coop is completely brain dead for the second player, like bad enough that an intelligent child would get bored of it instantly. My experience with this game went from a peaceful private getaway to a mirror of the frustrating situation of being trapped in a too-small space with too many people indefinitely.  If there was ever a game that can reproduce the annoyance and fatigue of sharing an apartment with 4 other people in viral quarantine, it’s this game.  If you have one switch and multiple people who want to play this game, don’t bother.  I really want to play it, I really want to like it, there are so many things about it that seem great for a single person to enjoy, but the multiplayer mechanics have made it impossible for me to appreciate these things. I would have paid $60 to avoid the disappointment and frustration this game has made me feel.  Anyways... bad move Nintendo, I really don’t understand the thought here unless it was a financial one.

Oh and they made it a lot harder to time travel in the game. On the 3ds animal crossing, I would set my game time 2 hours different because I like to play every morning at around 6:00 AM and my school starts at 8:00 AM. Everything important in the game happens at 8, so I just set the time so that when it's actually 6, the game thinks it's 8:00. Now it's harder to change the in-game time, so I literally cannot play the game because everything important happens while I am in school. Wow, Nintendo's first party games are getting so bad. The older ones like Smash, Mario Kart, BOTW, etc. were really good but Animal Crossing, Luigi's Mansion 3, and Mario Maker 2 are all really bad.

There is no shared progression toward islandThis review is written from someone who shares a console with other users, so the review will reflect that experience. Sharing a single island amongst several other players is seriously disappointing, and leaves much to be desired. Progression and game features are severely limited to anyone who doesn't play as the primary island inhabitant. There is no shared progression toward island milestones, and key items or crafting abilities are not distributed in the same manner, leaving an imbalanced playing experience. Players who are not the first to set foot on the island are demoted to mere scavengers of resources, with limited contribution to island development. The choice to not have separate islands for separate players, and to limit the developmental experience for players that share the island, is highly disappointing, and appears to be the greatest complaint with the game.  It became very apparent that this was a poor system wheat the point in the game where the first set of new inhabitants are joining the island and the primary player is given some dozen new crafting recipes and the objective of placing and furnishing several new homes across the island. Secondary players during this timeframe get none of the same recipes, are merely told to talk to the primary resident for instructions, and cannot contribute in any way to the progression aside from collecting raw materials like mindless robots. Not quite the shared gaming experience people are looking for. Certain choices like these made the experience feel extremely imbalanced and truly disappointing from the standpoint of someone who might not be the primary inhabitant. The only reason I could see Nintendo choosing to design the game in this way is to persuade people to have multiple consoles and copies of the game. One island per console is just not a good approach and could have been much better had single console multi-player been designed more intelligently.… Expand	2020-03-24

If player 1 isn't very active.... well too bad for everyone else. You must buy another switch for each person if they don't want to be treated as 2nd class. My family is so disappointed. We knew one island per switch was coming and we accepted that but the hamstringing of everyone but player 1 really kills the vibe. It also puts undue pressure on player 1 to make progress or feel guilty for holding everyone else back. Families don't need a game causing stress like that. We could just play monopoly or mario party if we want to have hard feelings with each other.… Expand	2020-03-24

In order to access all the features advertised as being included in the game you are required to buy an extra Switch for every person in the household and a new copy of the game for each of them.

While being limited to one island may seem terrible to many seeking their own islands on the same Switch Animal Crossing is meant to be a social expierence with friends and family members.

My gf and I our currently playing on our own switch and have had no issues with connecting to one another and going doing our own thing or helping each other gather resources.

If you want to buy, craft, build or sell things or just interact with objects and NPC, you have to click through the same procedures over and over and over and over again. You can´t just simply shortcut actions when done once. You can´t just hand over animals to the museum in a pack. You can´t just skip menus. No, you need to do this one after another and always go through the same question and answer procedures every time again and again. That is nonsense and game design from 1990.2nd critics: Nintendo linked one island to the hardware and that´s it, no matter how much accounts are on the Switch. At all, Nintendo should have given the option if you want to live together on one island or everybody have its own. But being forced to live on one island is just stupid. Nintendo agued that it´s for protect against cheating. But why the **** do you do this? There´s no competition in the game. When people want to cheat, let them cheat if it´s part of their game experience. Are you the mother of all gamers?3nd critics: it´s the worst of all and a reason to sell the game. Nintendo decided to give the full game experience just to the player who initiated the game first. HOW STUPID IS THAT. Everybody else on the Switch is not just being forced to live on the same island. NO. They can´t even do all the things that the starter account can do. Every other account on the Switch is downgraded to a worthless peasant of the leading player. Being restricted to do basic things, but not being allowed to change major stuff on the island like create buildings, modulate the terrain or doing any important action to develop the island further. Just the leading player can do that.Nintendo, that´s the most stupid game design I´ve ever experienced in my whole gaming career of 25 years. You are forcing families with just one console to devide into one major player and everybody else being peasant players. For a NON-COMPETETIVE game that was designed to player FREE and LIKE THE PLAYER WANTS IT TO EXPERIENCE on a FAMILY CONSOLE, you ****ing idiots.No Nintendo, you designed the game to experience it the way you want and sell more consoles.

You're limited to one island per console, so player two doesn't get a full experience. Player 1 controls the island, every other player is just a permanent visitor with very little control.

Only they may talk to Tom Nook every day for quests, get various crafting recipes that, as far as I can tell, are exclusive to them, only they can place the housing for new residents, start building the museum, and on and on.It's such an unfathomable misstep in an otherwise brilliant game. It's an easy 10/10 if they fix this, and fix it right. First and foremost, allow every player to make island progress and decisions, designating each player as the Island Representative role. Secondly, please, allow for multiple Islands per console; 1 for each player account.

You have the OPTION to fill the museum, buy every single item, buy every single piece of clothing, and even refuse to pay off your loan from Tom Nook because we all know he's greedy.

What's particularly disappointing is that anyone could have foreseen this: it's a family game and, given that there's only one island per Switch console, more than one person is likely to want to play it (unless you've got a very small family).It would not have been difficult to allow players 2+ to contribute to things like building new houses, but instead they're just left out in the cold. In this particular case they can read the construction sign, but cannot see the requirements or provide materials without sending them to the primary player.It makes a certain sort of sense to only allow one person to make significant modifications to the island, but even then it would not be a particularly big ask to allow the primary player to grant the rights to players 2+.Similarly, resources like rocks are relatively limited and are handled on a per-island basis: that is, if one player harvests the rock (by hitting it with a shovel - you can get up to eight items per rock without destroying it) no other player can harvest that rock the same day. Because of this, sharing resources between two people is challenging – three or more must be a nightmare.Nook points to get tickets to semi-random islands to harvest are a partial solution, but the rate at which one can gather Nook points slows rapidly as you progress through the game to the point where this looks like it's going to cease to be viable very soon (5-6 days into the game).Overall I'm really, really disappointed and I generally expect a lot more from Nintendo when it comes to games that can be played by the whole family. I'm not sure what Nintendo's goal here is; perhaps that we should have a Switch AND copy of the game per member of the household? If so, that's a losing bet, for sure.… Expand	2020-03-24

We ended up restarting so my fiancée could have lead since she plays more. We lost all of our progress which was frustrating, but obviously we kept playing so they must have done something right. This game is bad for player 2.Animal crossing on the GC allowed for all for players to have the same power. In this one only the first islander can progress the island?? Are you kidding me?? How hard would it have been to at least allow the other players to donate items to Nook for the store?? Or let them put items in the construction boxes?? This game isn’t family friendly at all. This game turned out to be a rip off marketing scheme to get entire families to buy the game and switches just so they could progress their islands.

The point is to have multiple people COOPERATE on one island rather than compete. In any case, that is ONE facet of this game. That is one little thing. A majority of the gameplay is solo. If you went into this expecting something different, that's not at the fault of the game at all.The fact that many cite the multiplayer as what makes this game a 0 out of 10 speaks LEVELS to how amazing it is. Imagine for example if someone hated how boring a game like Mario Maker is if you didn't have internet. That's what these complaints amount to.Almost every system has been streamlined and made easier or expanded upon with the exception of one: Tools. Furniture can be obtained in many ways, now randomly dropping from balloons (rather than just specific items), being able to be crafted, being able to be bought with both bells and nook miles, given away by villagers, found in trees, gifted by special characters, and of course from friends. On top of this, an improved customization system allows for you to change the appearance of many items on the fly, and for those that allow custom designs, that system has been expanded in all senses of the word: pixel art is now smoothed out, making it less immersion breaking. You can store a myriad of designs rather than 16. You have absolute control over the palette you color with instead of presets.Placing furniture is also a lot easier. Taking ideas from Pocket Camp and Happy Home Designer, furniture can be manipulated on a much smaller set of tiles than in previous games. A 1 tile wide object can be placed on half tiles, for example. An overhead view can be utilized in homemaking to manipulate many objects at a time. Wall items can be placed anywhere on the wall, even vertically above each other. Light objects are now dynamic, allowing you to really set the mood of your home beyond just their color.Furniture can of course, now be placed outside, meaning you have control over your entire town instead of simply your house and a small handful of monuments. This opens up the floodgates for a truly custom experience, and in a few weeks time, I am excited to visit the towns of strangers to see the creations they built.Villagers have a lot more personality now. Each one will interact with the world around them and have their own tastes in furniture and clothing. While before, their personality amounted simply to what bit of dialog they spat out when greeting you at best (Sporty villager always talks about sports), this has been expanded into them actually having a preference for what furniture they want on the island, what things they want you to craft, what they give you. I had a villager give me a hat once and I wore it. In previous games, that would be the end of that exchange, but in New Horizons, later talking to the villager, he had thanked me for actually wearing his gift from days prior. They acknowledge what objects are made for now, you'll have them say I exercise with this kettle bell! or This wooden double bed is so comfortable to sleep in! rather than This is my favorite [insert furniture name here] over and over. You will find NPCs sleeping under trees, or reading a book with their glasses on, or dusting their home. It feels more alive.Now, for the flaws. Kind of. New Horizons puts you in the role of a resident who just moved onto a deserted island, and you have to build up from there. Now, this is a very interesting experience starting out, and I actually love the idea of it. You gather materials to build your tools to build better things and unlock more decor or better tools, a la many survival games. The issue with it however is the late game. When you get to the end of Minecraft, Terraria, Ark, what have you, you have the best tools that almost never break. There are no equivalents thus far, the best tools are twice as good as the base tools, which isn't fantastic.The next issue is 1 island, which while minor, is still an issue as with all the creative opportunity, you have but one canvas to work on. If you want two distinctly themed islands, you have to remove the first to do that, and it's a little heartbreaking.Other than those two things however, the game improves on everything Animal Crossing, and I would recommend it to all Switch owners, and say it's a NECESSITY for any Animal Crossing player.… Expand	2020-03-24

I’ve always been a huge animal crossing fan as well as my mum, playing since Wild World. I have been so excited for this game for so long, which couldn’t have come at a better time btw. The game is visually amazing and there is so much more flexibility, more challenges and more to do. Placing items inside and outside, the crafting and customisation mechanic, choosing where villagers live, terraforming and waterscaping which are available later on are all unimaginably amazing features and really let you customise your island. Being able to play with 7 other friends is amazing, I have made huge use of this feature, having a large amount of friends who also play the game and this has enabled me to feel less isolated as well. I don’t understand why people complain about only being able to have one island, me and my mum have always had 2 characters on the same town and absolutely love it. We can customise ourselves and homes individually as well as sharing many experiences, such as working together to complete the museum donations etc and doing things for each other when the other is absent. The amazing thing now is that 2 people can play on one system at the same time, which is something we could never do before and I have absolutely loved doing this! People who say for 2 people in the same house to play together you need 2 switches, that’s simply not true at all. In the past this was true as you could only play one at a time and would need 2 3ds and local play, but now this is not needed as you can much more easily enjoy playing together as well as apart. People who leave 0/10 reviews obviously have no clue what they are talking about and can’t appreciate how great this game is and how many amazing editions have been made -crafting, customisation in seconds, placing everything where you want, changing your whole island layout, being able to pick up entire trees and move them, being able to expand your inventory, new hairstyles and facial features that you can change when you want much more flexible pro designs- can now make hoodies and different types of dresses etc and more!! The villagers are so much more lifelike as well.

And yet unless I decide to fork over an extra $360 to purchase a new switch and copy of the game, I will be locked out of this game's full experience.While this may seem like a bold claim to some, when you have a game centered around a small island, and then make players share that one island per console, you are essentially making them share a save file. Maybe I wouldn't be so upset about this fact if it wasn't common for every other game on the switch to allow multiple save files per console account.I have heard the argument that this has always been a feature in the animal crossing series, to which I say, look at Pokemon. When Pokemon transitioned to the switch, they dropped having only one save per device, and people are now able to experience the newest Pokemon games with multiple saves. I don't see any logical reason why Animal Crossing is unable to make the same transition.I'd also like to bring up the argument of target demographics. While it is true that the Animal Crossing series has always been able to connect with a wide audience and demographic, which is what makes the series so great I'm told, I still imagine that the target audience of this game series is children, seeing as the game contains a cute cartoony art style and is rated E for Everyone by the ESRB, allowing children to also experience the game. I can't imagine the arguments going on in households that contain multiple children right now over who gets to play on the island and who gets to do what on the island.The bottom line here is that Nintendo is shooting themselves in the foot by not including multiple islands as this both angers old fans and limits the amount of new players able to experience the game. The hardware is clearly there, seeing as every other game on the Switch allows multiple saves across Switch accounts, including old games that didn't before moving to the Switch like Pokemon.At the beginning of this review I said I'm not the best reviewer of this game seeing as I've been unable to play it. But for that reason alone, I'm rating this game 1 out of 10. I can see no logic in this choice of only allowing one island per console. I was really excited to try this series out for the first time, only to have that excitement squashed due to Nintendo limiting it's player base for this new game. I don't doubt the game is good, I just wish I could play it along with everyone else.… Expand	2020-03-24

The big reason to me is the absolutely clunky and slow menu controls, and constant poor decisions that smack you in the face every time you're trying to enjoy the game.I get that it's supposed to be slow and charming, but I think AC fans are too quick to defend the game's charm that they think any criticism on the game is unfounded. If AC fans actually told the devs things that were not great, the series might have progressed since it was created.This series was created on the GC when a lot of devs were still figuring out the do's and dont's of game development. Things like If you're going to make a game about crafting and customization, DON'T make the menu interface INSANELY SLOW, DON'T preface that menu with SLOW, crawling text that asks if you want to craft, DON'T only let us craft one item at a time, then DON'T make a five second craft and tadaa! animation that can be sped up by like, 5%, by jamming on the buttons, and then DON'T make us have to answer a slow, crawling question about going back into the menu, and doing it all over again. If I want to make a couple darkwood chairs, I have to slowly make each of them one at a (slow) time, then exit that menu and slowly enter the customization menu, and proceed to slowly customize them all, also one at a time.If I want to figure out how much items sell for, I have to SLOWLY sell each different item alone, because there is no other way to know (also, you have to deal with slow crawling intro text, and you get booted out of the whole thing to start over each time). You know what they could have done? 1) Made it quicker. 2) Made the shops show the sell price as you hover over them, 3) add the pricing somewhere in all that empty space on the critterpedia entries. So many options to have not done it it annoyingly, but they figured out how to avoid all of them.Don't tell me this is the charm of the game. The speed was charming back when there was barely anything to do in the game. For some asinine reason, they thought that clunky charm is equal no matter how it's utilized. But in a game that is now all about crafting and customizing at a scale it's never done before, SOMEONE on their team should have said uhh, this actually really sucks when all you're trying to do is build and customize a couple chairs and a table. Maybe we should change the crafting menu, at least. I'm hoping that at some point, the shop evolves and they're like haha, look at all these new features! Aren't you happy that it isn't so annoying anymore?, but even if they did that, I'd still be upset that they chose to screw with us instead of just MAKING IT GOOD.It sucks, because the large majority of the game is good - but it's like someone gave you a delicious ice cream, but then slapped you in the back of your head every time you try to enjoy it.… Expand	2020-03-24

It seems a lot of people don't get the community aspect of this series, and want to complain about the single island per console deal. I can understand why you would want the option to make a brand new save without loosing your original, but to complain that you and your wife cant have seperate islands, really misses the point of this long standing series. Why wouldnt you want to share an island with your wife or kids ...thats the point. Everyone gets to participate together, to create an awesome island that can be built over, literally, years. My wife and I work together to create a happy and healthy community. You can terraform the terrain, craft new items, work together to populate the museum, and more! This is a community building game. The only improvment I would have liked is for everyone in a multiplayer session to have imidiate access to their items without having to switch leaders. The fact you can only have one Island per system isnt a deal breaker, at all. People want to think that Nintendo did this solely for the purposes of selling more Switches, but the way I see it, this is more of a system built to prevent exploiting the game. As I recall, the only game that didnt limit the number of islands per console was the original, and that worked cuz the online capabilitiesof the game cube were very limited. Even the Ds games worked like this. And sure, it would have been cool if they could have solved this in a different way...but the switch doesnt save to the game cartridge, they are read only memory cards. So your island MUST be tied to your internal storage of the Switch. If everyone could make multiple islands, then the game would be very exploitable. I wish that Nintendo could have solved this problem while still allowing multiple islands, or at least one Island per account, but then anyone could make multiple accounts and create. But in New Leaf, i didnt see nearly as much hate for the fact that you had to buy the game twice to make a new file. And like I said, Switch carts are read only, so the game save has to be tied to the console. They could have done cloud storage, but that would mean any user without a subscription is locked out of the game. If Ni te di really wanted to milk their customers, they would ha e provided all the tools and recipies and exclusive tools and recipes, for purchase online. But no.

The game is great as a single player experience, even sitting around watching my girlfriend play is a fun time and helping her out by grabbing the controller to help her progress.Everything changes though when you want to try having your own animal crossing experience on your account. The game locks you into one island per switch, so whatever creative descisions the first player made is stripped from the second player.You cannot place buildings or structures, donate to the museum, or unlock more DIY tools or construction kits. You are locked by the progress of the first player, even though you are on a completely different profile. The only way out of this is to give Nintendo more money by purchasing a new Switch console. Yes thats right, want the full experience of this game for yourself but can't because someone started playing the game on the Switch first, for the mere price of a whole new console you can have that $60 on release game experience for only about 5x the cost of the game originally, thanks Nintendo, you have basically locked the gane into being a hard 1 game per console and advertising it as a fun multiplayer experience where everyone gets to help make an island together. Instead you have that experience for only one player and all the other accounts on your console are just along for the ride.

Just like player 1, they had to slowly and painstakingly put time into the game to get to the points you're complaining about.I understand the one island per switch, but there's two reasons for this.First, an island takes up a significant amount of space on your switch. With the addition of progression and adding items to your inventory, and your museum and encyclopedia, that all adds up. Then imagine every user on a switch, 8 users with their own individual islands, on top of that per user, 7 additional houses per shared island. That's a grand total of 8 unique islands, and 64 unique players. That amount of data adds up, quickly.Secondly, adding onto the data situation. The game allows 8 users total on an island. If you're playing online, the max is 8 on your island total. Given the switch has a total of 8 users, its the best choice to make. One island per switch, one player per user.To review bomb a game means you aren't taking time to understand and come to terms why the game is built like this.Overall, in my opinion, the game is a 10.

I will not be focusing on the multiplayer aspect, as I am playing alone on my Switch, and am not encountering problems, though I can totally understand the frustration of those who have to share a console/island. The game is built unfairly for those people.The game does not have hourly music, which is something previous Animal Crossing games are known for. I miss having quirky, hourly tracks, but the backtrack gets repetitive very quickly. The objective based system is a nice touch, but unfortunately doesn't feel rewarding, and does not lead to any larger objective. Gyroids also are not present in the game, and I REALLY hope they come out with an update.The game has a slow paced system, which is OK and echoes the Animal Crossing feel, but the delay of introducing characters/villagers/buildings/etc leads to a heavy lack in content. Who knows, maybe they weren't expecting people to have so much time due to the Corona lockdown! I am a bit disappointed that I'm already starting to feel bored after 4 days, especially when the game has been in the making for such a long amount of time.I'm hoping a lot of these problems will be fixed by either playing the game for a longer period of time, or updates.

But of course there are always some kind of problems. Its Nintendo, we all know that they make a lot of decisions because they want that $$$. We still give in and buy the games anyway. That being said here's some things I found wrong.1st, the one island per switch situation. We all know about it by now. We all dislike that decision. I'm not gonna go in on how dumb that is. Especially since I'm one of the lucky house holds with 2 switches. 2nd, you can't go on the mystery island tours with local or online players. One of my friends and I's favorite part of new leaf was going on the island tours together. Felt like this is taking a step backwards.3rd, we STILL can't kick out villagers once they moved in, just like new leaf you have to wait for the villager to make the suggestion to move, then say ok. Which sucks, cuz when nook gives you the task of placing the 3 houses for the new comers, you don't know who it will be until after you've finished making the furniture for said villagers. (Snooty jerks should start out in tents like the rest of us btw. But that's another topic all together). That is unless you had the nook miles to fly to 3 islands, happen to come across and convince 3 villagers you actually want to move into your island, b4 the task was given. Then and only then will you know who's moving in. Which feels like a slap in the face, since Nintendo advertised this game to let us pick and choose villagers 24/7.4th, not being able to relocate the plaza, airport, river openings and the mineable rocks. dont have to explain why this is flawed.5th, the museum dosent give you explanations on the bugs, fish or fossils once you found all the peices. In new leaf, once you donated something you can go in and read up a little info on what you found. Now you just look it up on your collections app or blathers can tell you about the bug/fish/fossils you find, if you have it in your inventory. Again felt like a step backwards.6th, took away the choice of what room to build. In new leaf you can choose what rooms to build in your home. My old house had only the back room, attic and basement done. I wanted to recreate that house. Only for nook to tell me that the back room was going to be made frist, then the side room...again step backwards.7th, not being able to put qr designs on all furniture items. Also some items not being customizable at all. Example, fence that I wish I could paint white, instead of buying the specific white version. Or wanting to put a custom color on the bed frame, not just the sheets.8th, no way to load your self made qr designs, from new leaf/happy home, to the switch. If you remembered to take a picture of every qr code for every design you made, congratulations! You can use the Nintendo app and download a non-editable version onto the switch...if you have Nintendo online. Locking, what was free in the last series, behind a paywall now is just shameful. People would have gotten Nintendo online for the ability to visit friends islands as it is. Which leads me to the final complaint.You know what really would have made people want to get Nintendo online for this game? CLOUD SAVES! They took away cloud saves to stop cheaters, yet people found a money glitch litterly on the release date!...But if you look past all these frustrations, the game is very relaxing and a fun time waster. A lot of these problems could be fixed with an update, so who knows what the future holds.… Expand	2020-03-25

Because of the franchise's famous real-time progression system, it maintains a fresh feel to it everyday.  It's the sort of game I envision myself playing 20 minutes a day for the next four years, not just grinding it all out in a month.  The vast new DIY workshop system and the customization customization system adds a whole new level to the ability for the game to be made your own.  The ability to terraform he island is also a very useful feature.  Overall, the game maintains a perfect balance of combining New Leaf, Pocket Camp, and Happy Home Designer into one game with the new and improved capabilities of the Switch.  The often talked about multiplayer aspect, though it does not affect me as of yet, seems to be a major drawback and is the only thing keeping this game from achieving a score of ten.  The Switch could easily have multiple islands per unit and the fact that one can't transfer their save data to another console is also a massive inconvenience.  Nintendo needs to realize its massive standing within the gaming industry.  If it is to continue to dominate and compete with the likes of Sony and Microsoft, it must adapt and allow these seemingly basic things to occur, rather than do obviously gouging their customers into buying entirely new Switch units if they wish to have multiple islands.… Expand	2020-03-25

(you can see fur...omg)• crafting and customizing mechanic • STORAGE • Flowers grow back• The museum. It's in every game but check it out room per room. Wow. I also have some things I don't necessarily like. Like how you can not access information on the critters you have already caught. You have to catch it again and ask Blathers about it. It gets a little annoying with bugs. I'm hoping I'm just not far enough in game and there's going to be an encyclopedia app on the nook phone.Also  sometimes I get caught on a barrier around houses and trees and it looks like I'm stuck moonwalking for some reason. A lot of people don't like that you can only have one islands per switch but I don't personally mind. I created new accounts so I could do a themed island based on the Odyssey. When Odysseus was on the goddess witch Circle's island. I understand that if your playing with siblings and you don't want then to mess up your island or vice versa it can get annoying. I hope that maybe for those of you who have issues they will release an update that allows you to choose on your profile if you wish to join the residents of an existing island or forge your way on your own island.None of the issues I faced were gamebraking and I still really enjoy the game as a whole.

Considering that Animal Crossing is a game that many people play for years, it would be terrible to lose all of the progress when your Switch gets damaged/lost or you simply would love to get a different Switch console.Other than that, it is a incredibly cute game that keeps me wanting to go back and play every day, which I was not expecting, since this is my first Animal Crossing game I've ever played.… Expand	2020-03-25

Having multiple villagers on one island, only one can experience the full game, but also stops others from getting further. This gives other players the feeling that they are missing 20% of the experience. From an other players’ perspective, this isn’t great, and the only thing that would make me happy is to just give each player an option to either join an existing island, or create a new one.(Also with couch co-op, please allow followers to use the favourites wheel)… Expand	2020-03-25

With the core functions of the old games and the new functions added in, the game is a brilliant blend of nostalgia and a breath of fresh air. Animal Crossing continues to be a relaxing experience for the player and maintains its charm in New Horizons. It's nice to have a new spin on the things we're used to seeing from an Animal Crossing game.In regards to those reviews being left that are upset about there only being one island per console, I share this. From Nintendo themselves on the official Animal Crossing New Horizons website: Up to eight Nintendo Account holders can live on the same island within each game. With one Nintendo Switch system and one game, up to four of those Nintendo Account holders can play on the same island at the same time (additional accessories required). With additional systems and games, up to eight players can play on the same island at the same time via local wireless or online play. Nintendo Switch Online membership and Nintendo Account required for online features.This was clearly stated before the player even purchased the game. This is the way that animal crossing has always been. 1 island per console. The fact that you are even able to have multiple villagers from the same console playing together on the island at the same time is unique to this game only in the series. And they've actually upped this from the typical 4 villagers living in one town to now 8 villagers living on one island, allowing larger families to have unique villagers for each family member. Why would you have multiple islands to choose from on a game that has historically only ever had one town per console, regardless of the type of system the player is using? Playing on a family Wii console with City Folk? One town. Playing on a personal handheld console with Wild World or New Leaf? One town. Just read the information on the game functionality before you buy a game. The game is great all around and is one for the books, just remember to read what the game-play is before you purchase a game.… Expand	2020-03-25

From a single player standpoint, this game is amazing. It has lovely graphics, as well as being jam packed full of content. The only reason this isn't getting a perfect score is because of the 1 island per console rule. I play with my sister, and I was the one who started the island. After watching her play for a bit, It was clear how the game satisfaction to both players were very different. She didn't get to decide where structures such as houses or shops would be placed, and it was a bit confusing at first to figure out how she could get the recipes that I had already learned by completing missions such as donating to Tom Nook. This leads me to my next point, which is how player two wont get as much satisfaction from the game as player one would, whereas player one had to complete an objective to gain an important tool crafting recipe, which has a sense of reward, while player two would have the recipe appear in the shop, not having to work for it. If Nintendo had added the feature of being able to have multiple islands per console, there would be no question that Animal Crossing New Horizons would get that perfect 10/10 from almost everyone.… Expand	2020-03-25

I've been playing since Gamecube, and it meets the AC formula and expands on it.These reviews I see about it needing to be more open world, in my opinion, would be against the Animal Crossing feel and design. It's not an RPG, it's a sim where you interact with the villagers and relax.The other reviews about people complaining how Nintendo is like EA are completely unjustified. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I remember on Gamecube if you wanted your own town, you had to get another memory card.  City Folk for the Wii was one town per Wii. I believe Wild World and New Leaf you may have had to just buy the game again, not sure about that one. However, it's always been pretty based around sharing a town if you share a console. I also don't have to pay to win. Nor is it a trash game with a amazing title slapped on it to make a grab for money(Battlefront).Objectives are just kind of there if you want to do them, they're handed to you as you play. Reviews are saying objectives aren't clear, but what's not clear about just living life on a island? There isn't really suppose to be a point to the game, you just get creative.I would wish that they would bring the art exhibit back to the museum, as well as the swimming mechanic from New Leaf. Other than that, amazing game. Brings back a lot of the same ideas from the Gamecube. Long Live Wisp!… Expand	2020-03-25

The game itself is very cute, very Animal Crossing, and very easy to pick up for new players. customization is more extensive than in any previous AC game, allowing for more unique experiences in the game. Online multiplayer is also super easy compared to New Leaf and I find my island has become a hangout hub for all the friends who’ve visited. For fellow Time Lords, There is also notably no and I repeat NO consequence for Time Traveling, assuming you stop at every day on your journey, talk to every villager once per in-game day, Sell your turnips within the week you bought them in, and collect your bonus Nook Miles at the start of every day. I feel like a lot of NPCs who seemed a little bland in New Leaf have been revitalized in this entry (Blathers especially.) Many NPCs from past games are not present however; those who enjoyed City Folk’s Cafe and were hoping for a return will be disappointed.Overall I can’t get enough of this game.

I've faithfully bought every nintendo console, and every Animal Crossing game, and New Horizons was no exception. Leading up to the launch I was hesitant and skeptical, but still full of hype and excitement. As the game started nearing towards launch I started getting worried about the lack of content shown, and the rumors of removing gender-related content.Indeed it seems both worries ended up being genuine and it turns out that New Horizons has received *massive* cuts compared to older games. I'll start with my chief complaint which is that the ability to play as a girl has been removed entirely, at least to my knowledge. There is a gender option at the beginning of the game which does nothing, and characters misgender you regardless of what you pick. Feminine walk/run animations were removed entirely. Likewise all gendered comments (including compliments) were removed. The game makes no reference to gender at all to the point of misgendering people. The option is basically there to lull you into a false sense of security.Most of the game's content is locked behind weeks worth of waiting, which is particularly bad for an AC game but not unprecedented. The game shipped without *any* holidays, and requires online connectivity to access such content. More or less every major Animal Crossing character has been cut from the game (including Redd, Katrina, Brewster, Harriet, Rover, Kapp'n, etc.). Despite AC usually being about freedom of choice, the game pretty much railroads you for the first several days (as opposed to the usual quick tutorial sequence). It's already been almost a week and despite going at full pace, able sisters are nowhere to be seen (they come after about 2 weeks, instead of the usual which is being there immediately)..Patterns are back, but not the way you'd like. To get full use out of it you also need a 3DS and copy of New Leaf, so that you can make certain patterns inside of that game, make a QR, then get your phone, scan the QR, making sure you pay the monthly fee for Nintendo's online service. Only *then* can you get every type of clothing in the pattern maker. NH lacks certain pattern options so you have to scan them in. There *is* a few more options which is nice, but it's not as much as I'd hoped.Art is removed entirely as redd is gone. Gyroids are gone entirely.The positives of the game are the nook miles system, which I wasn't very excited for despite it being a solid addition, and the crafting. Crafting is fun, but is just the usual furniture system albeit with an extra step (collecting resources) which means the process to collect furniture is now even *slower* than before. The game is lacking in content and to make up for it they drip-feed the existing content at a snails pace (much slower than previous entries).I really like that you can send letters to IRL friends without having to visit their town, which makes the letter sending feature actually useful. Terraforming seems cool but is end game so I don't have that yet. My complaint about AC: New Horizons is the exact same complaint I had about Zelda: Breath of the Wild: it's a great engine, but there's no game there.All in all what i usually come to Animal Crossing for is an affirming creative space where I can be myself and talk with the virtual npcs who can act as affirming and supportive friends. You won't find that here. The villagers in game have repetitive stale dialogue, misgender you and your IRL friends, and are very lacking for the first week (you only start with 2 and get a third after almost a week in). On the plus side the animations and actions they can perform are much more detailed and involved which is great.All in all this feels more like an animal crossing engine with injected transphobia, sexism, and hate. If you're looking at animal crossing because it seems like a cute welcoming game where you can get creative and relax.... you're better off with New Leaf, as New Horizons is just kinda a let down. I know looking back I'll probably revisit NL rather than NH. Perhaps I missed something? This may be the last AC game I buy if things continue like this.… Expand	2020-03-25

Beware, even during a quarantine, only the first  account has access to do anything remotely fun on this game.

What drops this all the way to a 2 is the fact that I cannot do anything at ALL to advance the game when she isn't playing.  Okay, so I can add to the museum...but I couldn't get the museum to exist, and I cannot get anything else to happen.  I am beyond peeved, and Nintendo's silence in response to criticism is deafening.  I am furious about this, and would return this game IMMEDIATELY were it not a gift.  What on Earth happened to Nintendo?  I will NEVER buy another game or game system from Nintendo until they fix what they screwed up.… Expand	2020-03-25

I bought it for her on my switch as we live together and have been watching her play. She was having a blast so I I decided to join the fun! Upon starting a new player, I was shocked that I couldn't have my own island, but I thought that it wouldn't be an issue. So I joined her island and placed my tent, and started to gather supplies and fish. It was awesome! I played for 5 hours collecting all the fish I could and saving up money for the house. I figured I would help my girlfriend out and add to her projects to progress the island but quickly realized that my options for progression or helping progress were utterly null and void. I was disappointed but continued to play anyway until I could not go any further without my girlfriend (the main player) progressing forward. The next day my girlfriend and I were looking forward to playing local co-op, and I joined her game only to realize that my options for local co-op were also wholly lacking. Not only could I not access my inventory, but I also couldn't interact with anything. Not to mention that anything I picked up not only didn't get saved to my player, but it also didn't get saved to my girlfriends player; it just got shot to some community box in the Community Center. I was reduced to pretty much just following her around running in circles.Safe to say that was the last straw. I went from being utterly enamored with the game, shouting praise to my friends, to being completely turned off. The only way for me to enjoy it would be to buy another switch for $300 and another copy of the game for $60, and I'm not going to spend $360 for one game.The game is great otherwise, and minus the lack of multiplayer and almost disrespect from Nintendo to the 2nd player, I would have quickly given this game a 10.… Expand	2020-03-25

4	GoldenAbysses	Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a beautifully crafted game that stays true to it's origins... if you're the first player.

I bought this game in hopes that I could share it with my sister, but those hopes have been crushed. I started the game up first, as it's sort of tradition for the older sibling to play the game first in my family, and I had no idea that I was taking away so much freedom from my sister by doing that. When I heard one island per console, I assumed that the island would be the same on different save files. Both me and my sister could transform that island into whatever we wanted. But, sadly, the grim reality is that she can't do anything on my island. She can do the basic things: catching bugs and fish, shaking trees, paying off her debt etc, but she's left out of doing anything important. Any important progress, like choosing where the buildings and bridges go, is only reserved for me. She's not allowed to have the fun of collecting resources and building our island up from the bottom, and it has ruined both of our experiences. I feel guilty personally knowing my sister, who was greatly looking forward to the game, is extremely disappointed and heartbroken at this development. She can't have fun, and I can't play the game without feeling a sense of guilt. Nintendo absolutely needs to fix this. The game itself is wonderful, I've been having a great time playing it myself, but I can't rightfully advocate for this game when it's been such a huge letdown and disappointment for my sister. I don't even mind if they keep the one island per console rhetoric, as long as my sister has the same freedoms I do. If Nintendo wants us to play together, then why are they restricting everyone except for the first player? It makes absolutely no sense to keep true to the friendship and bonding aspect to the game if you're literally making that impossible by both restricting any second player onward and making couch co-op practically unplayable.… Expand	2020-03-25

I would of liked to see more streamlined menus, sometimes when selling and navigating menus it can be a bit slow, an option to speed things up would of been nice, and with the multiplayer, I think the way we invite other players to our town could of been more streamlined and have less loading screens.One big complaint people have is with the way Nintendo decided to handle multiple users playing. You can only have 1 island, and the first person to launch the game is basically the one in charge, the 2nd player has a slightly limited experience, for instance, you have  to wait for the 1st player to trigger certain events such as building Tom nooks store, or deciding on where to place a bridge, and until they do that, your island will be kind of locked in a state where you don't have access to those things until player 1 unlocks them. On one hand it is a bad decision, given how there are better ways this could of been managed, but on the other hand this is Nintendo, and their vision, and this is how all animal crossing games have been more or less. However I think they should of went the extra step with multiple residents living together and I hope that they can improve things even more in the coming patches or next release.While this game is amazing and has things that can be improved, I think a lot of the review bombing is from people that have a serious case of You didn't make the game I wanted you to make and now i'm upset.

9	SenpaiJake	Animal Crossing has been a series beloved by many, and for good reason. It is a feel-good, calm and open-ended game that allows the user to live a second day-to-day life among the animals of the world. Animal Crossing: New Horizons stays true to that formula - in some cases - while also breathing a much needed plume of fresh air into the series.New Horizons drops the player into aAnimal Crossing has been a series beloved by many, and for good reason. It is a feel-good, calm and open-ended game that allows the user to live a second day-to-day life among the animals of the world. Animal Crossing: New Horizons stays true to that formula - in some cases - while also breathing a much needed plume of fresh air into the series.New Horizons drops the player into a deserted island setting with two other random villagers. You are here by order of Tom Nook and his apprentices Timmy & Tommy, who have set a vacation package for you. You start off the game in a cycle of material grinding and crafting, almost as if you just started a new Minecraft world. The newest functionality in the series to date here is the crafting and use of raw materials. You will build tools (a lot), harvest raw materials from rocks and trees, and continue crafting each day to make new furniture, fulfill any requests Tom Nook lays out for you, and to even build some homes.While there are no true end-goals or end game, Animal Crossing has never been about that. The game does give a player a general direction, in which you and Nook will build the island into a bustling little community, where you have complete control on housing location, bridges, inclines, and even the terrain! The creativity mixed with the endless amount of items there seems to be leaves for many to dump hours daily into a series you would typically only play for an hour or so every so often. This in addition to the Nook Miles, a set of finite and smaller infinite goals, allows for an addictive and repetitive game play experience. House decorating has received a major overhaul with the new drag and drop editor (a godsend!). The developer definitely focused a lot on small details too, with the gorgeous graphics depicting realistic rain, wind rustling the trees and weeds, detailed bugs and fish, and even the ability to eat fruit for a reason!While New Horizons expands in many ways, there are some choices that have left the game feeling a little bit lonely, and others confused. Things such as Gyroids and the Cafe, or other staples of the series are completely missing. The Happy Home Academy no longer has a cool online showcase of player homes, and has gone back to simply sending you random gifts each week. A lot of the Nintendo-themed game items seemed to have disappeared, and the ones available have become extremely harder to obtain and there are few of them. One of the saddest changes to me so far seems to be with your villagers. There are so many to possibly have move in, but unlike older games where villager interaction was a major part of what you do, it feels very stripped down in New Horizons. Villagers, more often than not, repeat the same dialogues each day, and usually don't have much to say in general. It's rare to get one caught on a tangent, or ask you random questions, or request your help finding an item. In New Leaf you could even play games like Hide and Seek with them, but in New Horizons it seems they'd rather stay home or stretch in the town plaza and say a couple blips to you and that's it.Lastly, multiplayer and the handling of saves naturally come into the discussion. A lot of people have shared concern over the fact one system has one island, and while it might be shocking to new players, this isn't the only Animal Crossing to function this way. One system usually holds one world for multiple players to play on. While they have locked progression to the first user; a bad call in many ways, the overall state of it is typical here but I can see why it would obstruct the fun for many families or couples who only have one switch. General multiplayer, especially online and local wireless, is basic and for that its fun. You can set best friends, and you can all visit each other's islands to talk to locals, hang out, and acquire materials. No qualms there.Lastly, we have to look at the save backups. There currently exist no way to do so, but they have stated they're working on a system to cater to those that need it.New Horizons is an amazingly fun and addictive title with beautiful graphics, cheery and calming music, and endless creative possibilities. While it's a great AC game, many series fans will be bummed about the loss of many series mainstays and might find it lacking for that matter, but it has become widely accessible for that reason, and I can safely say it is a wonderful game and I can't recommend it enough for its gameplay and aesthetic alone.… Expand	2020-03-25

None the less, it’s up to her to progress the game, building items for new homes, opening the museum, etc. On top of that, she’s given recipes that I don’t get to make these things for the home. The secondary account is just at pure disadvantage. I knew coming into the game that we had to share an island, which I had no issue with. What I didn’t realize was that I had to deal with a caste system and have my villager live like a second hand citizen.

1	realPhali	I'm sure this is a great game if you live on your own or have a Switch all to yourself. If you don't; well, bad news - this is basically a one player per console kinda deal. If you have kids or share a console with a loved one - don't waste your money on this.	2020-03-25

0	KillerUnleashed	Ended up returning the game purely based off the fact that it locks all other users on the Switch out of progressing the game. We will repurchase it when this is changed but it is complete brainless game design.

The current system lets player 1 get the full game, with all other players only objective is to complete nook miles.Worst part is there was not even a warning at the beginning of the game letting the players know that the first person to play gets full control.

I got Pocket Camp on IOS and played it for a maximum of 20 minutes. It was simple and bland and turned me off the series while i still respected it. I thought it just wasn’t for me. Boy was I wrong (And i should’ve assumed that the mainline games were much better than the free mobile game). When Animal Crossing New Horizons was revealed, i thought it looked charming and was interested in giving it a go and i’m so glad i did. So far this game has been a magical experience. Watching the deserted island grow into a thriving society is very satisfying. Gameplay is so calming but also engaging. The game starts slow and  progresses while you complete tasks, fish, catch bugs, pick weeds, and build houses for upcoming residents. If i could say one thing to new players: It’s ok if you feel like you’ve done everything you need to for the day and feel like you should put the game down. This game is all about patience which can sometimes be frustrating but also very rewarding. Some days, once you’ve done your daily tasks like gather materials and talking to the villagers, there’s not much else to do and you have to wait until the next day where more stuff will be available. This game is designed to be played over several months and years so don’t rush it and take your time, building your town and getting everything the way you want it. This game is absolutely visually stunning Running at a gorgeous 1080p 30fps. That 30fps might seem like a bit of a bummer, but rest assured it stays at 30fps and never dips and still looks very smooth. The best thing about this game is it’s charm. Talking to each character is such an enjoyable experience. Multi playing with friends is smooth with no lag and a good way to trade items. This game is very addicting and you’ll most likely find yourself spending hours into the night. Keep in mind that the game will keep posing new quests and challenges weeks down the line. But a lot of this game is customisation and making your town look the way you want. I love this game so much, and if you are in the slightest bit interested, give it a try. I didn’t think this sort of game was for me either, but that is because it’s not enjoyable to watch someone else play the game but having your own journey is where the charm lies.… Expand	2020-03-25

I couldn't help get bugs/fish to Nook, I couldn't help get materials to help build the shop, I can't help set up the new houses, I can't help build bridges, I can't help contribute anything to the game's story. I'm basically locked in progression behind her; I had to wait for her to get the axe before I could. I have to wait until she's able to build the shop until I can use it. Some of the little activities you can do for points are locked by story progression, so I'm stuck doing the same things over and over with no variety until she progresses the game. And that's so unbelievably frustrating to me since we can't have our own islands. I'm not even talking about simultaneous co-op.

Older installations would share the players in the sameMy family and I (mom and two daughters) were really hyped about this game because we have all had very strong attachments to past installations to the franchise. We were very excited especially because this game came as a gift from my dear brother, but lo and behold the game locked my daughters from continuation in the game AT ALL. Older installations would share the players in the same town, much like this game, but they DO NOT stop normal progress to secondary players. The most secondary players would have to endure is dealing with whatever name the first player gave the town and sharing a house that could be altered by all of the players on the game. Now, players can’t do so much as chop down a tree or purchase a haircut without going onto the primary account.    Usually these problems would be circumvented by buying another game cartridge to create a separate town, but Nintendo has decided to make the game CONSOLE EXCLUSIVE. Not cartridge exclusive which already has a hefty price of $60, but there is a required additional fee of $200 dollars minimum for a switch lite, which has very limited capabilities, or $300 dollars if you want a competent console. Us players will expect to have to pay an additional $240 to $340 dollars should ONE person get their own chance at actually playing the game within a reasonable capacity that the advertisements and previous expectations Nintendo has lead its audience to believe.   Maybe this could have been avoided because by simply not purchasing the game, but how should avid fans of the Animal Crossing expect this kind of product to come out as non multiplayer friendly? Others could argue that with the last main game, New Leaf, was single player and that New Horizon is technically multiplayer because there are multiple players existing on the same island. Keyword: existing, not playing. The game should be justifiably playable like, y’know, a game. No less a $60 game. New Leaf was advertised as your own experience and your own town because you are the mayor. This experience is uniquely yours and was advertised as so.   Maybe we are expecting too much. Maybe it’s too much to ask for autonomous gameplay for all of the players, despite that capability being apparent in other games on the switch such as Pokémon and on older AC games on inferior consoles, despite the switch being capable of running beautifully rendered and complex games such as Zelda BOTW, it must be too much for the game. Sadly, we were advertised, very strongly might I add, that the game would be capable of multiplayer in its many advertisements. We were told many players can participate in Nintendo’s “Island Paradise” when the reality is that only one player with a sizable sum of money can experience this “Island Paradise” while the secondary players are basically forced to watch as this “Paradise” taunts them for not paying the $300 gateway fee.   I hope that future purchasers of the game take all of these points into account and choose to buy this game if they are buying for a single person because this game is by no means suitable for a family or even a pair of friends as turbulence can arise from there being only one person allowed to play the game. My family certainly experienced turbulence and I wish this game has never graced our home. Furthermore, families with multiple switch consoles should wait until the price of the game drops dramatically because other games at a similar price offer so much more.  Tldr don’t buy Animal Crossing New Horizons if more than one person will play it.… Expand	2020-03-25

Effort was definitely made on this game. I can tell that there are different types of things to do in game. However I almost guarantee that I will never get there. For now, I really like the game. For now. Multiplayer is awful, I bought it so my wife and I could enjoy something fun and it turns out that second player is just one person as the leader and the other follows them around pretty much unable to do anything but pick stuff up. Pointless and not worth setting up in the first place. As far as online goes I won't even bother trying it. Having 8 people able to draw off of my already dismal material sources at anytime just isn't feasible. Iron nuggets are hyper rare at best. I get one on average for every two days I play. I think the idea behind this is to encourage online play.At first I was super excited, this is a new and unique concept to me. I don't predict I am going to care enough about it to play more than a week or so. I have a situation in which I need a tiny number of iron nuggets and at the pace I'm going I'll have flat gotten tired of trying. You can spend certain currency to go to vacant islands and take supplies, but you will only get so much of that currency so if you don't think before you spend you will find yourself in short supply and only able to get a bit every day.The whole game appears to be geared towards tiny amounts of play time. At an hour every day I have ran all but the most common resources out. Even weeds no longer spawn on the parts of the island I can reach. If I have two inventories of high value items to sell, the second inventory (And so on) always seems to sell for substantially less which means it becomes annoying trying to grind for money.Tools that last require resources that I can't afford to spare if I want to progress the game, so I am currently unable to craft them. This was a terrible oversight at best. I've resorted to making cheap tools over and over again and have ultimately found they are more cost efficient in the long run.I can't recommend this game. I will continue to hang in there and update my review for as long as I can hold my attention on the game but again I doubt I'll even still keep it downloaded on my switch past a week or two.Don't buy it.… Expand	2020-03-25

So please, take it from me, a genuine end user. It's not just pointless negativity. Something tells me the critics never played multiplayer. These dev's are trying to **** you. Now with that out of the way, let us proceed.Animal Crossing: New Horizons promises to let you travel to and inhabit a deserted Island. It reels you in by telling you, It won't be like before, we swear! like an abusive ex.Don't worry you'll be able to move houses and services at your leisure! (Eventually and for 30k/50k per building) You'll be able to terraform* the island to your vision. (Again, eventually, and not anything on the shores.) You can even live there with your whole family!* (If you don't mind anyone besides the first resident being treated like glorified visitors with a house.)Oh but only one island per switch guys because... we want everyone to buy their own switch. (in a global recession because the average family has tons of excess money right now, and definitely aren't all living way below the poverty line. Greetings from America!)Here is what they don't tell you:1. Only the first resident can advance the main plot points, and unlock those features they lured you in with. If you aren't first resident, you won't even be able to see the recipe's for the objects/furniture you'll be forced to craft, in order to advance the plot.2. You have to build everything on this island for everyone one. Don't invite people to live there cause it's gonna be you grinding all day e'ery day for the resources. Not really the Island vacation package it was sold as.3. there is Inconvenience baked into the game. Half of the upgrades just get rid of some annoying inconvenience that you were just putting up with. Advance the plot (if you are first resident) to have a slightly less miserable time. I think that's a really lazy and corrupt form of game progression, used only by those that lack the imagination necessary to offer genuinely fulfilling progression rewards. I'ts like hide and seek but you get to remove your blindfold after thirty games (or something.)Also ignore any excuse that these annoyances are in the game to ensure fairness, because there are already many money exploits in the game. So in the end it's kinda like the Games for Windows Live disaster of yore. You know, that time when Microsoft thought it was cool to sabotage the stability and enjoyment of their games in the hopes of preventing piracy, which happened anyways.  Hamstringing your product to preserve fairness is a fools errand. you might as well ask the sun not to rise.So the main issue is, if you buy this game you are telling Nintendo that this is an okay business model. Naw it's cool, us consumers are total suckers. Hey if another Zelda game comes out make sure that only the first person on the console to play the game can advance the plot. so you can force us to buy more switches.Other than all that total BS, it had some pretty enjoyable aspects. For one, you don't need to take a freaking personality test to change your hair color. (These developers are asinine.) And everything was pretty much 24/7 until we made progress. (then it went back to their traditional stance of, **** night owls.) But as soon as I found out the game was just gonna treat me like a chump indefinitely, like unpaid labor, it kinda drained any aspect of working for fun from the game.… Expand	2020-03-25

Secondary players can only run around him, do some stuff, but their inventory is non-existent until they get the leadership (meanwhile everything they got as secondary players gets stuck in a limited-size box owned by the player who was a group leader)...Have I told you the story of how I ruined the first impression for my older brother, who technically was the first player, but I was the first to actually play the game once the island was created, and I was the one to collect all the available resources...//Yeah, I was wondering, why couldn't I progress any further for the last couple of days.

But like some sort of Sisyphean hell, true creative freedom is agonizinglyAfter a week, I honestly regret playing this game at all. I put up with the slow early pacing, the clumsy core gameplay elements (effectively untouched since the Gamecube days), and the tedious and dull crafting system, because the level of creative potential that New Horizons promised was incredibly tantalizing. But like some sort of Sisyphean hell, true creative freedom is agonizingly restricted by the poorly thought-out mechanics, leaving me feeling miserable for having wasted my time in the first place.New Horizons' most prominent additions are hamstrung by half-baked, outdated, inconvenient, and unintuitive design decisions, making them far too frustrating or shallow to be worthwhile.The new terraforming tools, for example, give an unparalleled ability to treat the island as your personal canvas. However, by the time you unlock them, your town will be populated by around 15 buildings such as stores and homes, many of which you'll likely want to move once you gain the ability to freely create rivers and paths. In Stardew Valley (a $15 indie game developed primarily by a single person), the interface for moving farm buildings is incredibly simple and convenient: pick up a building, and pop it down where you want it; boom, done. In New Horizons, moving a building to an altogether new location involves paying a substantial sum of money ($50,000 bells) and waiting overnight. It's even worse If you wish to only move a building slightly, as you have no choice but to first move it somewhere else, then move it back where you want it (requiring $100,000 bells and two days; and you can only move one building a day). I play with time traveling, yet having to wait day after day after day to move multiple buildings around is still incredibly obnoxious even for me; I'm sorry for anyone who's actually trying to play this game in real-time.Another botched new feature is the crafting system. Tools break incredibly quickly, and crafting more is an obnoxiously slow process. Resource gathering is shallow and awkward, amounting to little more than brainlessly smacking rocks and trees. For some ungodly reason, a crafting bench placed in your house cannot use resources you've stored in your home's sole Storage menu, meaning you have to pointlessly retrieve and later re-store multiple types of materials every single time you go to craft. In summary, the crafting system is incredibly half-baked, pointlessly time-wasting, and the minor benefit of being able to craft some simple furniture is capsized by the disastrously tedious tool replacement loop.New Horizons allows you to switch between a front-view camera angle (as seen in New Leaf) and a more top-down angle (similar to the Gamecube version). This is a huge improvement over previous entries in this series.... and yet still comically half-baked by the standards of the broader industry. Why can't Animal Crossing just have the same camera controls that have been standard in third-person 3D games for 20 years?… Expand	2020-03-26

8	MorningStarn	I've been a huge fan of the Animal Crossing franchise ever since the original on the Gamecube and after playing this game for the past week almost non-stop, I think I can say that it's definitely the best in the franchise thus far without a doubt.  The game gives the player so much freedom and choice on the fly from changing the look of your character to choosing the layout of your islandI've been a huge fan of the Animal Crossing franchise ever since the original on the Gamecube and after playing this game for the past week almost non-stop, I think I can say that it's definitely the best in the franchise thus far without a doubt.  The game gives the player so much freedom and choice on the fly from changing the look of your character to choosing the layout of your island down to the ground and water beneath your feet.  Never before have I felt so free in an Animal Crossing game.For how much I love the game, there are of course some downsides that many other users also are reporting.  The biggest of which that everyone and their dog is talking about is the 1-island-per-switch thing.  Now to be fair, this isn't unusual for the franchise, it has almost always been a 1 town per console game ever since the original on the Gamecube,  other than my sister who plays this game on occasion, I'm the only one playing so I'm not really affected too much.  Normally I would forgive this though since it's nothing new, I would forgive it if it weren't for the other issue that everyone is talking about being the limited Co-op.  This is a relatively new issue that started in New Leaf, where being the second player sucked because all the cool things that allowed you to customize and play to your heart's content was exclusive to the first player, so it made being anything other than the first player essentially boring and pointless.  I would've expected Nintendo to be smarter this time around and remove that pesky quirk, there's no reason you can't have more than one mayor or an assistant mayor/Island representative that is capable of doing everything that the first player can do except maybe delete the island, but I guess that didn't cross their minds for whatever reason?  Again like I said, I basically am the only one who plays this game so I'm not really blowing a fuse over this but for anyone with siblings or loved ones who also play this game a lot, I can see how it's so frustrating.  In this situation, the problem is not so much that Nintendo is Behind the times (they are but still) the problem is more like Nintendo taking 3 steps back when it comes to Co-Op this time around.Other than that, I think the positives still out-weight the negatives by a longshot.  The freedom to customize and change almost everything about your island is a huge positive.  All of the new additions are certainly welcome and the amount of quality of life changes regarding the menuing, the inventory system, the ABD and shopping, etc. make me wonder why I put up with the problems in New Leaf for so long.  The graphics are pure eye-candy, places like the museum are simply beautiful on the Switch to look at.  Playing with friends online is also a pleasant experience, although I do wish it was possible to play on other people's islands outside of your friends list for anyone who allowed that option.  Overall, it's a pretty great game for anyone who's new to the series despite its flaws, it is a must-have for anyone with a Switch IMO… Expand	2020-03-26

As someone who's been playing since 2002, and by proxy grew up with this franchise, I love the amount of customization that you get with this iteration and it blows new leaf out of the water for this reason.

As someone who's been playing since 2002, and by proxy grew up with this franchise, I love the amount of customization that you get with this iteration and it blows new leaf out of the water for this reason. There are problems, but most are not nearly as pronounced as some make them out to be. DIY being the main gimmick puts the control directly into your hands, so you get to build the island in the most literal way possible. Certain construction projects still require you to wait a day before getting to use it, but that's nothing a little time travel can't fix. Time travel, though I personally don't like it, circumvents most problems that come with how this franchise's progression works, and while some people just want to max out their town as soon as possible, animal crossing has only ever worked when there's something important to do. When you complete everything, what else is there? So, if not for this flaw that all animal crossing games suffer from, it'd be a 9/10. Only having one island per switch is annoying, yeah, but at the same time, is it really a reason to give a rating that should be reserved for games like Sonic the hedgehog (2006), or crappy movie based games like shark tales? At worst this game is a 5/10, at best it's an 8/10. Clearly, Nintendo should've made islands pertain to the profiles and not the system, but this game is such a perfect sequel to the previous games. New horizons was made for a certain kind of experience, a one player experience, in which you could do almost anything yourself. I haven't shared a system in years as these games and systems became more personalized and tailored to this kind of experience, which puts my score into perspective, but that doesn't mean I excuse it's flaws. I certainly feel for those who can't afford a second console and I want better for those who are stuck in that shared purgatory, but video games in general have come to a point where everyone has to have their own system, something that was very prevalent with handheld systems like the DS that only ever allowed one profile. Wireless connectivity has taken over and it's no longer the days where you would simply have your own memory card and put it into slot B, then plug in your second controller. So few games do this anymore where you can just grab a second controller and play split screen or do anything of the sort. I can't say whether it's good or bad that games are like this now, but for my personal experience with this game, I give an 8/10.… Expand	2020-03-26

If you didn't start the island, if you want to contribute to the island, you are going to need to get used to cooperation with the island leader. That kind of sucks.

If you didn't start the island, if you want to contribute to the island, you are going to need to get used to cooperation with the island leader. That kind of sucks. I don't have a problem with it as I play with my family, but I'd imagine siblings having issues with this. Do keep this in mind before buying if this is important.The other issue I have with this game is the first week or so. It's sloooow. Even for an animal crossing game. It was kind of tempting to time travel at a few points. If you pick up the game, stick it out until the upgraded resident services building is built. It does pick up from there.As far as negatives go, that's all I got. Now here are a few things I love about the game.First of all, the game has a ton to do. From decorating your island to designing shirts, hats, and dresses, you'll never run out of things to do. That, along with unlockable features and buildings all along the way, you'll find yourself popping in every day, and getting sucked into it and next thing you know it's dinner time.Also, the online exists. Its like new leaf's online. Not great, but eh, it works.All in all, I'd 100% reccomend picking up the game. Ignore the butthurt review bombers who read an article on Kokatu and suddenly hate the game over something that hardly applies to them. If Nintendo fixed the way the island sharing works to allow non-leader residents to contribute more, this game would break the review scale.… Expand	2020-03-26

Co-op and multiplayer is not the issue, as some people might want to play the way it is implemented. The issue is that any other account on the system that plays AFTER the first person to open the game is FORCED to play a lesser experience that happens to be shackled to the multiplayer experience. It is then not an equapl, stand alone playthrough with all the features of one.A lot of reviews are fair in their scores because they played the full game with no problems on one account. That is fine. But a lot of people have more than one account on their Switch. To say that the opinions on the game by people affected by this are unfounded is frankly ignorant and it doesn't address the core problem.It's 2020 and we can't have multiple accounts play their own instance of a game? Yes we can, Nintendo has just chosen not to here. For a game that is trying to be a calming community experience, It has only made me feel conned and frustrated and left out because of this.As someone who is sharing the game with someone in my household, however being the second account to play, I am forced to be an observer to someone elses enjoyment of the game. If you are not the first person to play this game on your Switch you might as well not play it at all as you do not get the full experience. That is unless you buy another switch to have the privilege.This is a frankly disgusting and pointless choice that only serves to ruin the experience for many people who buy the game and line the pockets of Nintendo. Even the person who played it first feels guilty for playing it, even though they had no control other it.Be wary before buying this game; unless you play on your own switch, first, on your account from the outset, you will not have the full experience you expected when you bought it. I will be extremely hesitant to buy any future Nintendo games because of this.On a positive note, the person who first started playing on their account on my Switch says it's a lovely game.

I wanted my wife to play this game too--but she can't because she'll be a glorified second class citizen of my personally created island and will be unable to make her own full progress and island creations unless we purchase another switch exclusively for her to play, plus another copy of the game.I continue to question how people are not as bothered by this as they should be. The level of greed in this company has officially reached EA levels. Imagine, being a parent and having 3 kids who share one switch--guess what? They're screwed because kids aren't known for being agreeable; messing with another kid's landscape, or building in places where another kid may not want structures, the list goes on and on.Nintendo fanboys will defend this decision (that was made in the interests of their corporate overlords; not for them, or you, or me) as normal in the animal crossing universe or as an overreaction by those affected by it. Guys, these are legitimate concerns and perfectly good reasons to be angry! I cannot think of another game that requires me to purchase another console if I want to share it with my household; because that's the reason console profiles are a thing since last gen consoles.It is highly unlikely Nintendo will remedy this ridiculous situation. However, it is 100% fair for people to express their disdain by using this platform to voice their reasons for giving the game a 0. Our complaints are just as legitimate as the critic reviews who gave this game a 10 (despite the obvious limitation at hand which seems suspect, maybe those reviews are paid, who knows?), as well as voting with their wallets--for some however, it is impossible to vote with their wallets if they've already purchased the game and have no recourse for a refund (which is pretty much everyone).That's okay, Nintendo is crying/laughing about this on their way to the bank and they know they can get away with this because you will gladly take Nintendo's virtual spit in the face and thank them for it.… Expand	2020-03-26

Player 2 just gets to sit back and watch things happen. I don’t mind sharing an island — I think it’s a great idea, but human villagers should have equal rights. I’m done playing this.

However with New Horizons I am frustrated with how rushed the game’s multiplayer functions. It truly feels as if the game was designed for only one player in mind, with the split screen added last second. The first player to play the game being the ONLY person able to make any progress to the island makes zero sense. Until you realize that it’s one island per Switch console, making it obvious that Nintendo is doing it for the money. Being the second player to play the game absolutely sucks. You can’t even pick up items off the ground and have them go to your own inventory. You have to pass leader back and forth and if you accidentally pick up something while not being the leader, you have to go retrieve it from a recycle bin. The second player cannot even open their own inventory to equip items, they have to cycle through their favorites with X, and if you pass what you want you have to cycle through them all again. It just feels completely clunky when you aren’t playing as leader. I don’t understand why they didn’t simply allow the second player to also have inventory access, even if it’s one player at a time. It also makes no sense at all why each account can’t make their own island. Even if you buy 2 copies of the game, the second copy is essentially scrap because its all tied to the console itself. Bottom line is in order to let more than one person have the full game experience, they also must purchase an additional Switch console for their self, which is extremely greedy of Nintendo to do.… Expand	2020-03-26

A different system is required to create a different island.The island save data is saved on the Nintendo Switch system, so there will only be one island (save file), even if different games are used on the same system.If I purchase a second system, can I transfer the save file (island data) to a different console?Animal Crossing: New Horizons does not support the ability to transfer your save file from one Nintendo Switch system to another.Is this game compatible with Save Data Cloud?This game does not support the Save Data Cloud functionality of Nintendo Switch Online.When multiple players live on one island, does everyone have access to the same places and items?There are some tasks on the island that the Resident Representative (first resident on the island) must complete before the related features will be open to other players. For example, only the Resident Representative can receive and set up Blathers’ museum tent.It is not possible to reassign the Resident Representative role to another player. If certain places or items in the game aren’t available for island residents, have the Resident Representative progress to the point where the item or feature is available for them, then try again.So for people who are trying to defend this by saying this was always the case with the franchise, firstly its not true, secondly its frikkin 2020, there is literally no logical reason for not letting people have multiple save files, the only reason is to make people buy new consoles.If you intend to play alone, lucky you, but most of us don't. Think of a couple or a family with kids, don't tell me they should buy a new console for each family member just because the franchise was always like this. Im sorry, but this is just BS.Original review: Was looking forward to play this with my wife, then I came across the information that the game is limited to one save per SYSTEM, so not even buying two copies of the game is enough, I would need to buy another switch just for this game... wtf director Aya Kyogoku and Producer Hisashi Nogami ?? why dont you want me to buy your game??… Expand	2020-03-26

If you are the sole owner of a Nintendo switch, do not share the console with others and are a fan of the genre then purchasing this game is almost a no brainer.However there is a MAJOR ISSUE with this game and that lies within sharing the game with other profiles on one console. It's a massive shame that greed has taken hold of Nintendo here and has resulted in some extremely anti-consumer practices. Honestly, I expected more from Nintendo. Basically the first profile on the switch to play this game has the full experience (which again, is great), then the following profiles that play have a watered down version of the game, it's almost as if Nintendo are punishing those who don't own their own console. This practice is very old school and Nintendo are obviously way behind in this area. This is almost EA standard of ant-consumerism and they have bucked up their ideas in recent times. I seriously hope Nintendo sort this issue out, mostly because their greed and anti-consumerism is tarnishing and destroying the reputation of a very good game. For the reasons above I have to give this game a 0/10, such practices shouldn't be happening these days and especially from a company that is so family focused. Thanks for reading.… Expand	2020-03-26

It is as expected.The good:-better graphics with dynamic lighting based on weather-customization of your Island allows for making the exact town you want-putting furniture outside for the first time-nook miles gives daily and long term motivation to do many varied things in the game and allow for faster progress and reduce boredom-You now progress more than just your house and the store, which gives a better sense of growth-museum is way more pretty-custom items are an amazing addition, custom hats, shirts, pants, skirts, face art(think adding facial hair) , and even ground tiles can be added.The Bad:-Made multiplayer very poorly-multiple people in the same town cannot help add to growing the town, and can get soft locked by recipes that aren't given to them-Island tied to your console, not the game save on the cart or even your nintendo account/profile-you cannot transfer you Island(save data) to another console-Nintendo refuses to provide cloud saves for no good reason(claiming to prevent cheating and manipulation, even though time travel is still possible and used heavily).-Not enough new content. The game needed a new villager type or two. Needed way more new bugs, fish and fossils to keep me trawling the waters and carefully treading between trees. At that, different tree types would have been nice too.-crafting only 1 item at a time. It gets tedious and annoying to craft tons of items in a sitting. No idea why I can't craft 20 fish bait at once instead of one at a time, watching the animations over and over. That isn't gameplay, that isn't fun, that isn't relaxing.-Would have liked to see other static town NPCs make a return, especially bather's kin with the observatory and the cafe. The police dogs are also sorely missed.This had the chance to be the quintessential animal crossing, but it failed on all fronts and just became another iteration, a fun one, but nothing special. It isn't a Smash Ultimate, but if you want a relaxing game or just a return to the series, it is adequate. Just don't expect to enjoy any multiplayer, this is a very single player game, and be sure you have the switch console you want to have forever, don't settle for a console you don't want, because upgrading either means a new console, or losing ALL your game progress.… Expand	2020-03-26

A bit crappy, because there is a lot of people that preffer to put dedication or enjoy to play alone or just preffer to not have their kids messing with the island and the things youve done but it can be tolerable. Except its not. Because the game implements a system where the first player or user that plays the game, is a leader that consists of granting progression lock to all other users. What do i mean? It means that if the leader player hasnt played trough some part of the game, no one else can ...  it hears like a joke, like, havent you thought the leader player could just abandon the game and force everyone to get stuck? Or just not play as often and delay the hell out of the other users? This game seems promising, but so many stuff limit you for no reason whatsover really, who thought it would be neccesary to force everyone to share one single save game, and at the same time lock the progress to all users except the one who first booted up the game? Yeah, because its not the user who bought the game but the one who plays it first. And yes, you guessed it, there is no way to change this leader player unless you delete all save game data and let the game as new and unplayed.

As player 1, I spend most of my gameplay feeling guilty and feeling bad about making decisions that she’s not allowed to participate in or trying to balance between wanting to do everything but not wanting to take all the resources from her. As player 2, she spends the gameplay basically just being a visitor to the island, never able to make any actual changes or shape the island how she really wants. She’s also locked out of many little tasks (such as helping Gulliver). This simple mechanic that would be easy to fix in an update has truly ruined the experience for both of us. The fact that Nintendo is trying to use this as an opportunity to sell more switches is absolutely absurd and it’s honestly really disappointing.

The reality was not cute. My boyfriend didn’t think I wanted to play for some reason and set up the island and strippedWhen my partner first told me about Animal Crossing, I was kind of excited. I’m from a tropical region and, while I hadn’t played it as a kid, I had played Harvest Moon, and the prospect of making my own cute farm island was a reassuring way to pass COVID-19 quarantine. The reality was not cute. My boyfriend didn’t think I wanted to play for some reason and set up the island and stripped  it of all resources. I had no idea how ACNH worked so I started a save file thinking I would either get my own island or have different resources generated for my file, or like anything a reasonable designer would think of, right?Instead of starting with a tutorial explaining what choices would be permanent and unchangable, I got a message that just told me to put my tent down. Noticing all the trees were bare, I confusedly put my tent close to my bf’s and tried to figure out what to do.  After running around breaking my flimsy tools for two hours trying to get wood and stone that wouldn’t spawn, I looked up what was happening. Not only was there no way to respawn resources other players had hoarded, accidentally or not, as the non “representative resident” I couldn’t donate to the museum until it was complete and I could not build the store nor decide where it was placed. I also learned that expanding our houses was impossible if they were too close, which seems like vital clarifying information in a game aimed at children.We tried playing for a few days but even though we were communicating it was not working out. We play video games very differently. I am impatient. My partner doesn’t like to put much thought into games or rush. I found out that I could time surf but my partner doesn’t want to do that since he is, apparently, “an animal crossing purist” or rather he doesn’t want the villagers to be “mad at him for cheating.”For those who are reading and saying “so what you’re just not trying to cooperate” we really are and ACNH doesn’t really provide anything to help with that! There’s no shared inventory pool so multiple players can easily contribute to helping build up the town.In order to send resources to other accounts on the same system you have to either mail them per item for 200 bells each (time consuming and not cheap x 12 items per day). Not exactly helpful. So after two days I had switched to hitting Nook miles achievements and using all my miles for nook tickets so I could actually like, get anywhere in the game without stripping the island of resources he needs to build the town. My partner was surprised I payed off my home loan before him. I told him I was using the Nook tickets like a revolving door to rack up achievements and resources. He said he had not used a ticket yet and had just bought hair styles. He was embarrassed to tell me this.  I realized I was making him feel bad about his playing style just by him having to watch how I play. I normal speed through games faster than he does but he never has to play the same file I do until ACNH. We had thought this would be a fun bonding activity while we were locked in but it wound up being stressful and anxiety inducing.The feeling we had fostered around the game was not one of shared joy and reassurance, but unease and mutual resentment, I resented that I could not run the island and build the town and my boyfriend resented seeing the rushed way I was playing since it took the relaxing element of playing away from him. So yesterday, I emptied my inventory out on the ground and deleted my Animal Crossing file. We have pretty good communication and lots of other games I enjoy so while upset, I’m know my ACNH experience isn’t as bad as it could be. I know if I was a kid ,who are the ~main group~ this game was made for, who had to share this with a sibling while in quarantine I would be crying. Even if we bought a second cartridge we can only have one island per switch system.Half the world is unemployed for at least a month, does Nintendo really expect people to buy second and third switch systems to play one game fairly?TLDR: I rate this game 0/10 for worsening an already traumatic experience of being trapped in my house with no control over the world, and making my partner and I feel bad for just wanting to play a game differently. Bad user experience design for no easy item sharing while demanding people share an island. This was frustrating as adults with good impulse control, I cannot imagine how infuriating it is for the target audience of children and teens.… Expand	2020-03-26

The big issue is that Nintendo gives one user per switch a completely different experience than anyone else who wants to play the game. I would say the new features and aesthetics are great , but they don't even matter when you have a game that is fundamentally broken at its very core. For example, I am the second player to start the game and decided to help player 1 with getting furniture for new houses. I  didnt get any DIY recipes for the items needed, and when I went to check the boxes for what was needed to create houses, there was zero info. Tom Nook just told me to talk to player 1. What is wrong with the developers to make a decision to encourage collaboration, but  only allow 1 player to have the resources to contribute?I love Animal Crosssing games and have played from Gamecube to DS to Wii. This game was clearly designed to push families to purchase multiple Switch Lites, and gives the middle finger for anyone that wants to fully experience a flagship game on their flagship console.

I made an account just to review this game. Because of my disappointmentI am a solo player who was entering this franchise for the first time. So the single island per console thing doesn't effect me, but in an era where other games can have as many procedural generated worlds as people can fit on their console hard drive...that makes absolutely no sense. And these islands are tiny.My first impression of this game is that it forces you to play it how IT wants you to. I have repeatedly changed my in game clock on my switch just so I can progress the game, and when you consider that you can hit the first time gate in 40 minutes, it puts you in an awkward position where your first day of the game is just shaking tree's and catching bugs and fish while trapped in the starting area. I felt like I was playing an early access title.What's worse is you are punished for your progression initially. You get locked out of content because the game decides you've done enough of it and then doesn't let you back into that system for 48 real world hours. At one stage you are not allowed to buy key items used in repeatable achievements because you are playing the game at the wrong REAL WORLD time. And this makes no sense when you consider the first version of the shop is available 24-7.The control mapping is bizarre, the tool system, which is arguably the most important system in the game is bound to the D-pad instead of the back buttons, which is annoying when you consider that fast moving insects exist in this game and you have to stop moving to swap to your net. Also the phone being bound to ZL instead of + symbol makes no sense..The + symbol is only used to access a specific menu in the phone...The central buttons on a controllers are universally used for key menus in most modern games so why was this an exception?To further add to the clunky issues with the game, the shop system puts filler dialog in everything, and only allows you to buy items in 1's or 5's, while some repeatable achievements require 3 of the item, so you either buy 5 to save time, or buy 3 increments of 1 just to save money. I don't know if future upgrades to the island make this simpler, but if that's the case, why on earth would game designs make players have to unlock intuitive design?If not for the returns policy of the retailer I bought this at, I would already have returned it. I will continue to play my $69AUD investment to the endgame and may change my review depending on how the mid-late game is.… Expand	2020-03-26

Currently, whichever Switch user account launches Animal Crossing first, is the ONLY account that gets the full retail game experience. All subsequent accounts have to play a miserable shadow of the game the customer paid for.This design oversight is so heinous, it's causing many people, including myself, to wonder if this is actually a ploy by Nintendo to get people to buy more Switch/Switch Lite consoles. As a life long fan of the company it would be pretty devastating to watch them go the way of EA, Zenimax, and so many other fallen titans in the industry.Extended Review:The whole world is on lockdown right now, and a fun, relaxing, life sim type game such as this sounded like a great way for my wife and I to enjoy some decompression time together. Not the case. I spent $60 dollars on the Nintendo store only to find that we had to share one island (not a problem) but that only ONE of the profiles on the switch was able to progress the story, and advance our island's progress.My wife was the first to launch the game. I made my character and started building my only little house on the island a few hours after she had some time with the game. Fast forward 3 days, and now I find that I cannot help settle new villagers, I cannot be given tasks by varying NPCs, I cannot contribute/have a say to the layout of new buildings and terraforming on the island, and a result, I've paid $60 for the pleasure of farming materials to trade to my wife's account for use as she deems fit.This is a wholly unacceptable state of the game and legitimately needs to be patched. I will be following up with my credit card provider tethered to my Nintendo Online account (bought the game on Switch store) and asking for refunds on the same basis that hundreds of thousands of Fallout 76 players got their refunds for: consumer ethics breach.Nowhere in any advertising or marketing material was I given the impression that only one person in my household would be able to fully play the game. I'm not talking about a subjective enjoyment of the game...I am referencing the clear and simple fact that only one account per Switch has access to the entirety of the game that was sold for $60 USD. Secondary, tertiary, and all subsequent accounts will have a miserable, gated experience and have 0 agency over the ONLY island the entirety of the household is allotted.Without a clear disclaimer being present prior to purchase, this is unethical and either needs to be patched or customers need to be refunded. Until either happens, this is a 0/10, awful, regrettable purchase for anyone not living/playing alone on their Switch.… Expand	2020-03-26

So no, this is not an option for multiple people to enjoy this game.3 - Online multiplayer.  Don't get me started.  I've never seen such a poorly implemented online from Nintendo.  This is WORSE THAN SMASH.  And that's saying a lot.  Firstly, you have to go to the airport, wade through seas of text, including the bird actually connecting to the internet.  Is this dial up?  Then when you finally get to of a friend's island, and someone else wants to join, you will have to sit through a green message popping up forcing you to quit your menu, a FIVE STAGE flight screen for the plane to arrive (God knows why this is necessary, what is it loading??), a save screen, and a cutscene of the person walking in the airport.  This happens EVERY TIME someone joints the island, and breaks up anything you're doing multiple times.  Absolute lunacy.  Again, not sure if this is incompetence or purposeful - Nintendo is known to hate online.  This is their way of saying - Online is unplayable, don't do it, just buy more switches and play locally.  Also, why are there no mini-games to play with friends like New Leaf?  There is nothing to do with multiplayer online and things get boring fast.  Would minigames have been so difficult to implement?4- No cloud saves at launch.  Apparently something is being worked on.  Why not at launch?  Is it so hard?  Are they so concerned about cheating?  People are time travelling like crazy as we speak.  They could have easily imposed some limitation like one cloud save per day.  This is just mean, honestly.  Pure meanness.  Creates unnecessary added stress about losing your save.  Apparently a download will be allowed once, but who knows if this is true.  Why??!These are just some of many issues.  What is Nintendo thinking?  They've been working on this since 2012!!!Don't expect a patch.  Like Mario Part, Smash, etc. there has never been a patch that improves the fundamental problems of the game.Single player is good but I have to give 0/10 for this because it can't be comprehended other than through a lens of cynical exploitation.… Expand	2020-03-26

Her progress was limited by mine, and since I don't play as much as her, she basically got a watered down version of the game.This is obviously a conscious design decision on Nintendo's part to encourage players to purchase more Switch consoles, since you cannot have more than one island on the same one. This creates a TERRIBLE experience for anyone who is not the first player - I can only imagine how much this would suck for a whole house of people who want to play together.This is similar in vein to how the online features are locked only to players with an online subscription. If they are not present - other local players can't play online, so the only way to work around this is to create the online subscriber's character in local multiplayer using another controller, and then just have them stand around, allowing other players to use online features.

New Horizons definitely checks all those boxes, even if it does very little to actually improve on the game's age old formula.One thing I see as a big step back (or at least a completely stagnant characteristic on par with harvest moon's stubborn refusal to include same-gender relationships while indie games like Stardew Valley do it so well) is the island sharing mechanic. I see a lot of people complaining that anyone who complains about this just wants to be ¨boosted¨, to stop whining and enjoy the game. The only logical reasoning is that those people are so entitled that they cannot imagine the game was not made for their sole enjoyment or so socially challenged that they cannot fathom how a family might want to share a console while still having a full gameplay experience for all players.While I will not rant on and on about how this is completely unacceptable, it does show that the developers either can't design a game that allows for separate and independent save files (a worrying prospect) or did not imagine that some people might like having their own, separate sandbox experience without either having to limit their own or other people's experience in order to do so, after multiple installments of a very family-friendly game (families usually have more than one people in them, and many will have more than one member interested in the game), which is brings me to believe that while Animal Crossing will always be able to deliver in charm, it will never grow to be better than what it is and will always be.This might be the last Animal Crossing game I will purchase, unless I see some effort on their part on actually creating an evolving experience with each game.TL,DR: Good and fun, buy if you have your own console, skip it if you have to share with someone else.… Expand	2020-03-26

Though I am honestly really glad that I can share the island with my siblings, but that being said, it should be completely optional whether you want to share the island or not. Finally, I don't really get why everyone are assuming Nintendo's intentions behind this decision; this was a thing for as long as I remember in the Wii days (Probably even GameCube?) to share the island/neighborhood with local users, and obviously Nintendo's intentions weren't for you to go buy another Wii; it was purely a game design decision that has nothing to do with forcing people to buy another console, and no one really complained about this in the past as much as now and that's why they never considered adding the feature of having multiple islands per console since they assumed that what's not broken doesn't need fixing. The game is fantastic and we really love it, and I really don't think that a red color is needed for Nintendo to notice everyone's feedback.… Expand	2020-03-26

You could allow all players to make choices, but then you run the risk of players unable to enjoy the full experience of the game as players would start arguing when someone places something in an area they didn’t want it to go. I get that this would open up the possibility for people to cheat and create multiple accounts and have multiple islands, which seems to be the likeliest of reasons when I searched why this wasn’t a feature already. The only issue with that is, people always find ways to cheat and if they do than that hinders their experience and it’s their choice so why alter our experience to keep them from doing something they are probably already doing anyway?

The secondary players cannot, for example, create new constructions, such as bridges or the store, they cannot donate materials for the construction of these projects ... In addition they also do not have access to a significant amount of item recipes ... They cannot participate in the missions of the game ... That is NOT FUN. This game should be appropriate to share with your family or your partner, with your loved ones, but clearly Nintendo does not want that.

Instant zero.” The game doesn’t even let you name your character something obscene.  You can report COMPUTER NPCs for being semi-inappropriate.  How is it not family-friendly? Have y’all never played the game before? It’s a SINGLE-PLAYER LIFE SIM.  It always has been and it always will be.  The fact you can go visit others’ islands in itself is a huge victory. I’m really enjoying this game.  The crafting is great, the tiered crafting is pretty cool too.  The museum looks amazing compared to past games and I want to catch EVERYTHING! Nook miles are an interesting add, weird, but nothing too essential has been sold there thus far, and what has I’ve been easily able to get the miles for. Heck, I had over 10,000 miles within a few hours and I was playing leisurely (as it’s meant to be played).I forgot the thing runs in real time, so it forces you to take breaks unless gathering and crafting and selling are your cup o’ tea.  Other games call in the meantime.  Great experience thus far about 15-20 hours (play time) in. Again, if you bought this and expected it to be a full multiplayer experience, you clearly didn’t know enough about the game and shouldn’t have bought it.  Your fault. End of story.

There are only two big issues for me:1) They still haven't integrated an in-game time travel system yet, despite the fact that you can only play about ~30 minutes to an hour every day if you don't time travel using the Switch's system settings. This is frustrating because the developers know very well that half (if not more) of the players playing the game will time travel anyway, so refusing to make it an in-game mechanic seems like stubbornness. A lot of time is wasted when you have to save, close the game, go to system settings, change the time and re-open the game every 30 minutes just to advance to the next day.2) As I had feared when the game was announced, the game sadly is not worth the $60 price tag, no matter how you split it. What it does do, it does perfectly, just like all the Animal Crossing games before it, but it just doesn't do enough to warrant the nearly-doubled price compared to New Leaf. There are apps on iOS that legitimately have more content than this game, and this game cost me a whole day's wages. In short, if you're a die hard Animal Crossing fan, you'll probably love this game, but then again, if you really are, then you were going to love it regardless of what I said. If you have not played Animal Crossing before and are looking into it, I would advise against getting New Horizons unless you are flush with cash.

It is addictive overall just like previous titles. Everything is so enjoyable from the activities you can engage with your friends who may also have the game. There is too much effort to be made in this Animal Crossing, from tools breaking as well as the Nook Miles System which I believe is not neccessary. I would also like to mention that another limitation I really despise the most is only have one island per console even though I am the one who mostly plays this game on my Switch.This game does encourage you to work your way up just like previous titles but more challenging.

Everything feels a bit more polished and improved from the last entry, even though there are can be slightly frustrating inconsistencies (such as the tool belt not storing your tools while the dressing wand does store the clothes) - but those are few and far between.The atmosphere is simply soothing, causing you to linger and stay for longer than anticipated even if you just quickly want to get some chores done.Unfortunately, the way online / multiplayer features are handled feels lacking and old-fashioned, but that's what we've come to expect from Nintendo by now - always 10 years behind the latest tech. Nevertheless, I personally feel that the island quickly becomes a very personal space that is best enjoyed alone, with only some irregular visits from others - so I don't put much weight on the online features.Also addressing the critisisms being voiced in the review-bombs at the moment:The one island per console limit has been known for a long time ahead of this release and people acting surprized and entitled just didn't do their research. Also goes to show how playing together on one island is really not the main aspect of the game, making the bad multiplayer features I mentioned even less significant.Having to share one island per console is nothing new for the series, the 3DS had it too. It used to be more easily possible to bypass it as it technically possible to have one island per memory card / game cartridge.… Expand	2020-03-27

The wait was brutal, but was it worth it in the end? I'd say it is! The graphics look pretty nice, the music is cheery and relaxing, and the villagers are even more enjoyable than in previous games! This game isn't perfect though. It doesn't actually become like Animal Crossing for 10-20 hours. The good news is it's still fun during the beginning. The whole crafting mechanic is really only for those early hours. Once I livened up my island (cleverly named Island), I rarely ever crafted after that. I don't appreciate how desperate it is to be different from the rest of the series, because I really miss some of the old characters. I do love the new ones, and at least Dr. Shrunk isn't in this game... I do love this game, but there are a few problems that keep it from getting a 10. For one thing, why is there still a 10 villager limit? The first game had 15! Island is big enough to fit a few extra people (or animals)! I'd even settle for 12! Also when you use a Nook Miles ticket to visit a deserted island? It's a really cool idea, but the island is way too tiny, so there's nothing to do, and a villager will only appear there when your town isn't full. I really want to get some of the new villagers, but I can't when it's restricting your opportunities. Granted, I was lucky enough to find Judy, a new cub, on an island, but that was after farming like 10 tickets! Also, there have only been 8 new villagers shown at this point! Are those the only new ones? I mean, I really like them, but that's just pitiful. The amiibo functionality is good too, but the crossover villagers from Welcome Amiibo aren't in this game! I miss Inkwell... Also you just have to get extremely lucky to get a new villager. I really want Cyd the elephant and Raymond the cat in my town, but there's no amiibo for them... I'm suprised that I was able to talk about the negatives for so long... Now on to the positives! Let me just say I haven't been this happy playing a video game since...maybe never. This might be the happiest game ever made. I bet it could cure depression (I'm serious)! The characters in this game are way cuter and funnier here than in any other Animal Crossing game. Everyone has their favorite one/ones, but this gave me several new favorites, and I love my old favorites even more! This game also has a lot of funny dialogue (maybe more than Paper Mario: Color Splash). This game has so much personality, and I love it! Its just so much fun! Even pulling weeds is fun now! This game is my 3rd favorite Animal Crossing game, my 4th favorite Switch game, and is probably in my top 20 games of all time! It really satisfied my expectations. It was pretty much exactly as good as I thought it would be. Most games nowadays are either slightly better or slightly worse than you expect it to be. The delays and stuff were really painful, but it was worth the wait, and every Switch owner needs this game!

Nothing except upgrade your house. An obvious attempt from nintendo to get people to buy more switches. In the past you could switch out you save card, you cannot mess with your saves in this game. You cant even send your data to the cloud to switch off saves because nintendo doesn't allow cloud saves. Which also means if u lose/break your switch the hundreds of hours you put into the game will be lost and you have to start all over. If nintendo wants to make everyone live on the same island then there HAS to be equal accommodation for EVERYONE on the island, but there isn't.… Expand	2020-03-27

However, as someone who shares a switch with their family, this game is extremely disappointing and limiting considering the fact that only one person can play the game to its full potential. I am appalled at the idea of forcing all owners of the switch onto one island where only one player has full control over progression while others fight over the limited daily resources. How unbelievably stupid was that decision? I know many will argue that this is how Animal Crossing games have always been. So? That doesn't make the decision good. For instance, Breath of the Wild was an instant hit in my household. This could not be the case if everyone was locked into the same save. Instead, everyone had their own save and could make their own decisions. Scratch that with Animal Crossing. My younger sister was eager the play after me, but couldn't find anything to do after 5 minutes. For a second player, this game deserves a 0/10. This stands true until every individual profile has the option to tend to their own individual island. It just ruins the experience. I hope these negative user reviews open Nintendo's eyes to this frustrating issue. Especially since the Nintendo Switch is advertised as a console to be shared...… Expand	2020-03-27

My sister wanted the game and she was the first one to play it, and after i started playing too, as soon as i discovered that i couldn't create a new island for myself i knew this was going the same way as new leaf.Except this time it's worse and buying another copy of the game isn't gonna solve the problem, you have instead to buy a new switch, and I'm not really willing to spend €200 for a Nintendo Switch Lite just for animal crossing. At this point, i'd be happy even if they added multiple islands as a €30 dlc, even if i know that would upset many people, because that's something i can actually afford.I don't even really get why this is supposed to be a good marketing strategy, since most people are just gonna be like me and can't afford another console, the only people i could see buying multiple consoles are people like famous streamers or youtubers.Having only one island per switch would have been fine if all the players could do the same thing, but only the first player can progress, and since my sister plays a lot less than me i just feel like i can't do anything and my experience is extremely limited, and due to this i just can't really fully enjoy the game, knowing all the time that your experience is this limited for me is just annoying,This review is based on my experience as a second player and i get that you may have a different opinion if you were the first player. If i was the first player too i would probably have the same opinion as you.So long story short, it's not a bad game, but if you're the second player your experience is severely limited and you can't fully enjoy the game.I don't want to sound like just another review bomber who goes like game bad, Nintendo < EA, I hope i do not sound like one.

The quality of life improvements they added would be the equivalent of a free patch for any other major release, but in Animal Crossing you pay full price for a new game. Listen, I love the Switch and I love Nintendo, but it's a miss for me. If you never played an Animal Crossing game, and you want a very chill relaxed game to play, and you are the only gamer in your house, maybe you could give it a shot.

For a single player, the game is fine. It's exactly what you would expect from an animal crossing game. If, however, you share a console or what to play multiplayer with a friend, you might as well give this game a hard pass. Nintendo has once again proven to be 20 years behind on modern online features, and has implemented what I can only describe as hardware based DRM. The first player to boot up the game will automatically become the primary player, meaning that the game cannot and will not allow any other player from progressing the game. Each individual user profile CANNOT make their own game to play and they will all share the island.  Yes, each switch can only have ONE island. It's not so bad if you are playing together but as two separate people playing at different times, anybody other than the first player is little more than a glorified visitor. When the first player progresses and unlocks furniture that can only be unlocked through progressing the game (save for complete rng gifts) the other players get the shaft and don't get the recipes. They have no way of acquiring many pieces of furniture. Other players can't have conversations with villagers, take progression requests from Tom Nook, or even deliver materials for a request that the primary player has already gotten. They cannot teraform, build bridges, pick out plots for houses, they can't even use emotes because a villager has to tell you about them before you can use them, but villagers won't talk to the other players.With the amount of things the other players CAN'T do there might as well not even be multiplayer.And this is all before mentioning the excruciatingly slow and tedious menus. You have to go through 3 prompts just to open your island up to friends. The menus function as if they were designed for a 3 year old to be sure they know what they are doing. Every. Single. Time. You catch a fish it has to zoom in, play an animation, and tell you that you caught a fish and say some dumb fish pun.Oh and any time somebody comes to your island, for some reason the game has to take you to a 30 second loading screen. Incredibly tedious if you have more than one friend. Why can't I continue playing while they load in?All in all the game Is held back tremendously by all the completely ridiculous and unnecessary restrictions, but that's good ol Nintendo for you. Any other company would be thrashed for the amount of ridiculous limitations Nintendo has put in animal crossing.… Expand	2020-03-27

The first game is Animal Crossing: Representative's New Horizons, the other is Animal Crossing: Build a house.The thing is, is that if you're the representative then this game is great. You get to contribute to the island and do a lot of events, progress through the game, and just relax and have fun in general. It's a crying shame that Nintendo didn't see this extreme design flaw, because otherwise I would've given this game a 10.Normally on the Nintendo switch, you can play one game on multiple profiles, letting families and such other groups have an equal amount of fun in a singleplayer game on a single switch. Now, Nintendo had the 'great' idea to make it so you can only have one island per console. Animal Crossing treats the switch as a huge save file. Now this would be fine, if all profiles/users of the switch could contribute to the island. Well no, only the representative has any control of the island, which means any other player can literally do nothing in the game at all. This is so extreme that I had to look at tutorials to see how I could get the recipe for the axe, which turned out to be that I had to pay for it. To get the vaulting pole? I had to go onto my sisters account and give bugs to Tom Nook just so I could progress. This issue is so extreme in fact, that most of the time you'll have to pay bells to get tools, either that or wait for the representative to do something specific. Now you can probably see why this would suck for a family or a friend or couple, but this gets worse. There is near nothing a second player can do in this game other than develop their house, that's it. This game turns from a relaxing game where you can have fun and develop your island, to a house maker simulator. This oversight really nukes the enjoyment of the game.Overall, I hope Nintendo can fix this big issue and restore my enjoyment in the game, for now though this has killed any will in me to continue playing. For now, I have to give this game a 1 due to my personal experience.… Expand	2020-03-27

As someone who isn't the Resident Representative I have to say it makes it hard to stay interested. My brother who is the Representative, always gets tasks to do while the only interesting thing I can do is pay off a loan or maybe build furniture. I have to deal with whatever he chooses to do because I have no other choice. It doesn't give me as much freedom as I expected. The game is supposed to be about how you build your own island and not about favouring someone over others. It forces the others to live on an island which is controlled by someone else.

The possibilities for decorating your island are literally endless, and the pro design feature helps your character feel like... you. Decorating your home and your island makes it really feel like you’re building a community from the ground up, and that’s an amazing feeling to have when you’re playing a game like this. New Horizons’ gameplay is therapeutic, and you can sink hours into the game without even realizing it. The islanders are all unique, and having all of these different personalities is part of what makes this game so immersive. Even the crafting feature, which I wasn’t so excited for before release, is such a great feature to the game. The museum looks beautiful, especially the fish exhibit. The Nook Miles system is also a great addition to the franchise as an exciting new way to get new islanders to come to your island. Overall, the single-player experience is a must-play for anyone who owns a switch. Now, on to the multiplayer. I have to say, some people who have been reviewing this game aren’t the sharpest tools in the shed. You can’t be mad when you realize that there’s only one island per switch after it was advertised to you. The online multiplayer was amazing from my experience, as you can get your friends to come see your island, and you can go see theirs. This adds to the feeling of community you get from spending countless hours on this game. I’d easily give this game a 10/10.… Expand	2020-03-27

That is so dumb to me and I don't see any other point of Nintendo doing that other then to lure you into buying a new switch console. I still played with her though, and the leader thing is also so dumb. If you're not gonna let everyone have their own experience, at least let us all talk to people and actually be able to go around. I am definitely not buying a $300 console just to play animal crossing, so i really hope they change this. It's obvious that they are doug it for greed, and I would HAPPILY buy another $60 game to have my own island. But that wound work either. So good job Nintendo, I CANT be the only one who is enraged by this. I'm not going to buy into your greed and get another console.

Unfortunately I got this game to play with my partner for 1 console co-op play. There really is no true way to play this way as was advertised. The second player is essentially an NPC. The UI and controls for single console multi-player are embarrassing for such a renowned title. I would give this game a 10 if they simply hadn't even included the feature at all; it's highly misleading. For it to work so well with online and multiple console multi-player, it seems like a regrettable attempt to force console purchasing. I would love input from the studio on why they failed to deliver a coherent single-console co-op. The UI and controls while in single console multi-player come across as if it was an afterthought  It is both hard to use and cumbersome. The inventory or tool selection isn't even available for player 2. Is it really that hard to apply the same feature to all players? Seems like poor code architecture to me. Not to mention the second player can't participate in the game contents in any meaningful way. Player 2 gets a very lazy stream of check with player 1 messages instead of having NPCs treat player 2 as a player rather than a tag along NPC.

It’s a fantastic game, just know going into it that there is only one Island per console, which was explained in a Nintendo Direct prior to the release of the game, and covered by many gaming news companies.… Expand	2020-03-27

When the game arrived I let her play first, but when I started to play on my Switch account I realized that there were some things off. It appears that you can only have 1 island per Console. That's absolutely ridiculous. There is a reason to have multiple Switch accounts and merging the accounts into 1 game is just wrong. It forces us to buy a new Nintendo Switch so that we both can enjoy the FULL experience. She can play the game normally, but I cannot do certain things like: pick an island, naming the island, build bridges, make houses for visitors, can't have DIY recipies and a lot of other things. I basically can only contribute to my sister's island. It's so annoying and it leaves a sour taste in my mouth. My excitement went from 100 to 0 real quick. I wasn't really following the news before the release, but apparently they mentioned it in a Three Houses demo live stream. I didn't watched the livestream so I didn't know. All the websites where they sell the game also didn't mention it and the website where I bought the game also said nothing about a 1 island per Console thing. Even the trailers didn't mention it. I'm just so mad about this, I've spend 60 euros and I can't even play the full game. I really want to love this game. It looks Hella fun, but as someone who started the game secondly: it feels more like a slave game. I really hope that they update this whole situation.

This gameplay loop is relatively unaltered for a second player who has to reside on the same island as the first. However, any meaningful progress, and thus reasons to boot up the game at all, has been stripped away for a second (or more) player.Being player 2(+) means you can not make progress towards the museum (and thus catching different bugs and fish is moot), it means you can not interact with villagers in the same way (and thus always have to resort to buying every item from the store, instead of being able to find the recipes through the story), and generally means you are living the life of an NPC on player 1s island.Being player 1, on the other hand, provides a well-polished and extremely rich game, fully worthy of a score around 9/10. It's a unique life simulator, where everything you accomplishes gives you no small amount of joy.In other words, this game is a gem, where one meaningful design flaw ruins the experience for hundreds of thousands of players (which I doubt is an exaggeration).I am contributing my own review in the hopes of any sort of change coming to this current setup.I am fully aware that having multiple islands per Switch is unrealistic, and would also detract from the premise of the game, but I do feel it should be possible for active players to have the same sense of wonder and explorations. Make npc's give player 2(+) the same items, allow player 2(+) to submit their captures to the museum, and allow them to contribute to the building of other items. I understand that the general lay-out of a town can be determined by one person, but that doesn't mean every fun element of the game has to be stripped away.Thank you for coming to my Ted-Talk.… Expand	2020-03-27

The controls are just.. awful, and apparently it's always been like this according to my boyfriend. I feel like with this being a new game, you guys could have fixed the controls so it's not a pain in the ass to whack a rock with a shovel, dig things up, capture bugs or chop down trees. You have no excuse to keep the controls the same as previous titles.-Story progression limitation, as mentioned with Island limitation, you, as the secondary player, cannot do **** meaning only the first character can do the story while you just sit there doing nothing other than upgrading your own house...so you end up having to wait until the the first player does things to do stuff. It really ruins the experience for everyone involved.… Expand	2020-03-27

Have been in the animal crossing fandom since the gamecube release. Me and my boyfriend bought a switch two years ago for the sole purpose of having a console to play on should they release a new animal crossing. When it was finally announced we were thrilled, mostly thrilled for multiplayer as we had always had to play at separate times in the past. This is not a multiplayer game. Only the leader gets access to normal features of the game, and you have to frequently switch out to get anything accomplished. You can’t fish at the same time because not enough fish spawn when there are two players, so you must take turns and decide who will catch what. Not only that, but I later learned that because my boyfriend was the first player to create an account, he would be the only one to get complete access to all gameplay. This means for any exciting developments, I had to wait for him to get on and get them done for me. As someone who plays more often, this is not too great for me. I love the game and the new features they have included, but it seems like they designed this game so you would absolutely have to purchase a second console and second copy just to get the full experience you were intended. I’m very sad as me and my boyfriend essentially have to fight over who will be the leader and it creates the opposite of a smooth playing experience.

I really like a lot of the new things that have been added, but I feel that so much of the old content that made the game feel well rounded is missing.

If you are not the first person to play the game on a console, you become a glorified NPC that can't do anything to progress the story. Nintendo is being aggressively greedy at the expense of their players, it is absolutely ridiculous that Nintendo, a company with some of the most skilled, talented, and smart people in the video game industry made such a horrible design decision for no reason other than corporate greed.Though if you plan to play this game alone, it is a very good animal crossing game reminiscent of the original gamecube game with many new features and an amazing story centered around building a deserted island with nothing but a few tents into a thriving, developed community. My only complaint about the story is that I think it should be (and can be) longer. The postgame, like all animal crossing games, has tons to offer as I expected, but there are a few omissions from the other games that make the postgame feel like it's missing something. There is no coffee shop, no fortune teller, no theater no barbershop, and only two shops. While the new island customization options and some other smaller features do provide some new postgame content, I don't think they add quite enough to make up for the omissions and I can't see myself playing this game for years like I did in city folk and new leaf.Even with the decent gameplay and story, I can't justify giving this game any points at all because of its glaring design flaw in the one save per switch rule.… Expand	2020-03-28

That means they can’t do any quests, can’t make any decisions, don’t get the same kinds of rewards or as many... And you’re limited in the progress you can make on the island to what the 1st player does  So short-sighted!Heck, 1/2 the time the “hot item” you’re supposed to sell is something the 2nd player doesn’t even have the recipe for. To fix this? You have to buy a whole other Switch game console. Not just a second copy of the game, which would be ridiculous enough in 2020. A whole 2nd console.So painfully and obviously GREEDY!!!Don’t buy it! 2- They purposefully didn’t warn anybody abt any of this anywhere on the game description, instead lauding it as the ultimate social experience. Fun for families, friends, couples... Bullcrap!!Bcs when you’re playing with someone else, the 2nd player can’t collect anything. It all goes into the collection box. And if the 1st player looks at their storage kit or takes their tool ring out, it knocks out whatever action the 2nd player is trying to do.3- Talk to them in the only way that will actually speak to them. Clearly the only way that actually matters to them.Until Nintendo decides that they actually give a crap about their consumers (I’m not even asking that they care more about their consumers than their bottom line bcs at this point it’s clear that’s not going to happen), do not support them by giving them the money they’re clearly after with this disgusting decision they’ve made.However, I am giving it 1 star bcs other than how limited the game feels, it is an enjoyable game and an enjoyable world.

To join someone's island, you must be friendsA theoretically great game, held back by Nintendo's frankly astounding inability to design multiplayer functionality given its. 2020. Setting aside how completely useless shared-console multiplayer is, the online multiplayer feels more like it's teasing you about how good the game *could* have been if Nintendo had competent network engineers. To join someone's island, you must be friends on Switch, a process which for some reason still uses friend codes instead of usernames like literally any other platform on the internet. Then, you must click through around 30 seconds of dialogue to visit a player. You have to go through this pointless dialogue *every time*. But wait! To visit someone they have to open their gates, which means going to an ingame location, and clicking through another 30 seconds of pointless dialogue. If you sleep, the gates will close and you have to do it all over again. Because of this, visiting another player effectively *always* requires communication through a 3rd party platform to coordinate your visit (no direct messages via your Switch account, sorry.)Once you manage to exchange texts, ensure the other person has opened their gate, and go to join them, you are met with an almost minute long unskippable cutscene. This plays *EVERY TIME* you visit a friend. It locks you, and all players on the island you're joining. Once you get there, the island's owner will discover that they are now unable to place/move any of their furniture. Why? Because Nintendo has spent a solid 2 decades pretending that the internet doesn't exist, and so has no engineers on staff that can make online functionality.The single player experience is great, but it's not worth $60. It's a fun game, but just go play Stardew Valley, it has more polish and plays much smoother than this half assed game.

Also, it's not only the story, the mechanics change too - I cannot even get the axe recipe without spending the money. The first player gets it through interactions with Tom Nook. And while the cost might be similar in both cases, the experience is very different - i really dislike it.The restriction of one island per switch is artificial and could easily be changed to one island per profile. I've already paid whole 60$ for this game - and because of the limit of one island per console it feels like the price is too high. Especially when we compare it to other Nintendo games at a similar price point like BOTW which can be played separately on different profiles.Animal Crossing has a family-friendly rating and so you would think it would be a family-friendly game, but if you want to play with your spouse or have more than one child you would have to buy a whole new Switch for both people to enjoy the game on their own instead of having to share an island because of some artificial restrictions.Also the fact that this cannot be remedied by buying a second game cartridge and only by buying a second Switch makes it feel like a cash grab on the side of Nintendo. I understand that the saves are stored on the console not the cartridge, but I am sure this could have been remedied in some way.I had very high expectations of this game and was looking forward to spending time on my island paradise with cute animal friends, but instead I feel like an NPC in my own game and I have to fight over resources with my friend...I wish I could give this game a higher score, bc it really is cute and sweet, but I don't feel like I can do that in this situation - thus the low score.I hope Nintendo rethinks this and patches the game, but I am not very hopeful that it will happen.… Expand	2020-03-28

We planned on playing on our own worlds and had heard that there was a way to visit each other’s local islands. However, we were met with a restriction on our fun that drastically contrasts a game in this style. There is only  ONE island per CONSOLE. Yes, that’s right, you can only make ONE island on each Nintendo Switch. It doesn’t matter if you switch accounts. The higher ups over at Nintendo have decided that with this $60 purchase you are granted ONE little island. But that’s not even the best part! You see, you can in fact join islands locally! Huzzah! But... you can’t progress, you can’t check your inventory, you can’t even walk too far away from the person who made the island. Thanks Nintendo! And so, that leaves my siblings and I in the queue for a refund, and a feeling of disappointment. Surely that can’t be what the developers had wanted right? Well, that’s what they created. This limitation can be interpreted in one of two ways: At worst, a greed-fueled effort led by Nintendo corporate executives to get consumers to buy more than one Switch, so that you can have more than one island, or at best, a way to bring players together locally so that they can learn what a leader and a follower is, and where player 2 fits into that equation.

Please add a feature of some sort where you can choose an option in Red Text three days in a row to get a villager to leave. People are going to time travel anyways.-Playing multiplayer with friends should not take so long each time to have someone come into your island. It's disrupting. The individual player should see the traveling screen, and then just pop a notification when it's been loaded into their friend's island.-You can only play one profile per Switch. Same console multiplayer isn't fun. Split-screen or individual menus would have been better, as well as not having only one person who can make decisions. It's a family console - Resident Representative should be a shared title, so they can all move things the way they want, or even have their own islands and use Call Resident to play them on the same island but keep menu functions.-No way to rotate camera for pictures, except to angle up. You can do it inside, why not outside?-Shopping gets boring after a while. Could the furniture selection change maybe twice daily? 7am and 7pm would be good I think. Or make a multiplayer selling option, bring back Reese and Cyrus to sell things to other players for you for a price you set (no more than a certain percentage over their regular price)-More visitors to campsite, more frequently. Let them teach players new patterns specific to that character. If each character had more specialty items it would be great.-Pocket camp lets you invite people to hang out, so why can't you here?

Quality gameplay, unique characters, not overly complicated.  Just an enjoyable game.  For anyone who has played the original Animal Crossing on the gamecube you will probably be the most upset.  Because you probably played with family members at the time, and enjoyed the minor multiplayer setup it had back then. This version has somehow managed to ruin even that minimal multiplayer functionality from back then.The trade off I suppose is that they enabled an okay form of online play.  But when it comes to Animal Crossing the most enjoyable way to play was with others locally who could setup shop in the same town.They would be able to progress the town if you weren't there, interact with the town folk, the folk then mention them in dialogue the next time you play.  And you really felt like you were living in the same town/area.  You'd be excited to see the what changes they made next or upset that they beat you to it.  But hey, that's life.  Well now that 2nd, 3rd, 4th player cant progress the story, or help new residents move in.  Some DIY creations are kept from them.  And it downright sucks to be that person.  Multiplayer is a huge part of this game which is why I'm giving it a 6 star.  Last quick bit on their online play: it is okay.  At least each person will get their own screen there. But it's not optimized and obviously hasn't gone through any QA testing.Animal Crossing is one of my favorite games so this is why I'm taking the time to write this review.  Ultimately my personal thought is they royally messed up this game by not putting really any more than an ounce of thought into the multiplayer aspect.  But again the series is great, the concept is great.  Ultimately they added some interesting content to the game now.  I'm excited to see what they add in future updates!  Edit:  P.S. Sadly the local multiplayer issues are enough to where I had to tell my brother to return the game.  As he was hoping he'd be able to play it with his wife.

While this game is graphicallly beautiful and the Animal Crossing style of gameplay has been taken to new (and better) levels. Nintendo made decisions around multi-player and family sharing that make this game broken.For me personally, the multiplayer shortcomings aren't too significant. I like walking around with my son and discovering new things and showing off our accomplishments. I am not a big online person so I have not tried that part of the game, but I do understand people's frustration at not being able to combine online and local multi-player to enhance the experience.I am more bothered by the way families (or Switch co-owners) are required to experience this game. The concept of needing a unique game and unique Switch to have separate islands is a blatant cash grab by Nintendo. This would not be an issue were the single island shared equally. There is, however, as system where the first person to create a character in the game becomes the island representative, which means they are responsible for decisions such as where new houses will be built. The location of  buildings is not a huge problem as you can spend five minutes sitting together and agreeing on these things. What is a big deal is that secondary players are EXTREMELY limited in how they can contribute to these endeavors. Basically, you can send or give materials to the primary player, but this means that when a secondary player is enjoying the game, progress is halted unless they take out two controllers. My son wants to enjoy the game in a way that is characteristic of secondary player play style, but he is the primary player. This has led to a few arguments already as I ask him to focus on an island progression task but he just wants to collect bugs. This would be tolerable if you could switch the primary player or there was some alert that this might happen, but there is absolutely no in-game indication of the significance of being the primary player.Bottom line, we are four days in and have made lots of progress, but we are thinking of starting over to save our family relationship. This game could have been amazing and allowed me to relax and have fun with my kid, but Nintendo broke it.Also, no online backup. Seriously, Nintendo, I am losing my faith in you as a company.… Expand	2020-03-28

I’ve really liked this game and would recommend it to anyone with a switch. For me, breath of the wild and Mario Odyssey are a perfect 10, smash is a 9, then I’d put Mario kart, Mario maker and Animal Crossing new horizon as an 8.

The graphics themselves have truly made the game franchise and villagers come to life! No detail left unnoticed, from the way the rain drops on the water to the way the wind sways in the trees. This game is truly a beautiful escape during such an unfortunate time in history. Even my husband who hasn’t been interested in previous games is hooked to this one. The crafting is addictive, and “Nook miles” objectives keep you playing for hours on end. This game is truly a masterpiece and I can tell there was a LOT of time spent on this game by the developers! Even the dialogue is simply fantastic. I haven’t seen such awesome dialog since the GameCube says. To all of those upset about the “one island per switch”, that is how every game has been except for the GameCube (one town per memory card). I don’t think it warrants a negative review whatsoever because it’s not a feature that has been taken away recently from the series. If that’s the case, where are the negative reviews for new leaf, city folk, and wild world?? My only small beef with the game (and why it’s 9/10) is that it is missing a large handful characters from previous games. Reese, Cyrus, Cappin’, Rover, Pelly, Porter, etc. are no where to be seen. If you are a long time fan of the series, you will definitely feel their lack of presence. There are new characters enrolled to fill the spots of some characters yet to make an appearance. However, hopefully with future updates they will return for an event or possibly dlc!… Expand	2020-03-29

The one island per console thing was bad enough, but then on top of that, your subsequent user accounts have a limited experience in the game too. Only one person gets to have the full Animal Crossing experience and that's awful for a family game. It goes far beyond that as well, though. So many of the features, items, and even signature characters from previous games have been completely taken away in this. There's some reviews on this page that list most of these things that were taken out, but the point is, this game feels unfinished and rushed. The good news is: Nintendo can definitely fix this with updates, DLC, and general fixes. The bad news is... I'm not so sure they'll actually do it. I can see them adding in *some* of the missing features, but I'll have to wait and see if they'll actually make this feel like a finished game and fix the issue of multiple people wanting their own island. I wouldn't even mind paying for the game again to have another island. For now, though, it feels incomplete and a bit unsatisfying for a huge Animal Crossing fan.… Expand	2020-03-29

During this time of being quarantined in our home, we thought this would be a great game for the kids to take their mind off of what’s going on in the world. The 5 year was the first to play the game, not knowing really how to read, he simply clicked through things and just started running around the island having a blast.  After that every other person in family played on their own users. We realized that we were all located on the same island. No big deal we thought. We each played for a few hours, but none of us could figure out how to make an axe. None of us had the option. After several frustrating searches we found out that since the 5 year old started the game first, he is the only one that can really play the game. Meaning that no one on the switch can make any decisions.  We had to delete all the saved data for everyone and start fresh on 1 user. This is unacceptable.

The first player to play the game is given the full experience. All other players are given a downgraded experience. Parts of the game are just missing, like naming your island, or choosing its layout. Progress in the game for all players is also gated by the primary player's progress. And all players are forced to have the same island, with limited space and limited resources.If I'd known this, I wouldn't have purchased this game, as we have one Switch shared by two kids. How is it fair to let one of them be the island representative, while the other is treated as a second-class citizen by the game?Searching online I see others trying to excuse Nintendo's behavior here, saying Animal Crossing has always been like that, but:1. This is false. On the 3DS you could only have one game save per cartridge, but you could use multiple cartridges with a single 3DS. On the Switch you need two separate consoles.2. When classic games with limited save slots are ported to the Switch, the number of save slots from the original are normally made *per-profile* on the Switch. For example, in Link's Awakening there are only 3 save slots. In the Switch version, there are 3 save slots *per-profile*. Likewise, one would expect that Animal Crossing would have one game save *per-profile* on the Switch.3. Having mis-features in the past is not an excuse for propagating them into the future.Nintendo went out of their way to make the game terrible for anyone but the first player. It's pretty clear that their motivation for this is greed. Instead, they've made me strongly consider returning this game, and avoiding their platform in the future.… Expand	2020-03-29

It's so sad but let day they have a reason for this (actually this is just a stupid restriction)Then you realize you can't create a basic tool because the menu to do it (a dialog with Tom nook) just doesn't exist for non-main players..... Whaaaat ?Ok, you think ok the main player has to unlock this so others can use it. . Ahah. NO! You CANT.Either it's a bug (so basic ?) Either it's a feature, a deliberate choice. Then the game is unusable and the marketing strategy is  like this game ? Buy each kid a switch, each kid a game and shut up. ErrrrrrrAmazing.Don't buy it. Or prepare for a fight at home.Oh ,I almost forgot. The local multiplayer mode: useless, the 2nd player is just a pet following the other, farming for him, more slowly (stupid animation each time you pick up a piece of wood...).

I agree with all of it so I'm just going to focus on the bad.The bad:- There is WAY too little content for a $70 game. Half of the characters seem to have been axed (Brewster, Katrina, the dream suite, Leif, Gracie, the aplacas...). I kept thinking, 'Is this it? Is this all there is to the game?' when I realized that the last character to unlock was KK Slider.- Needing the Nintendo Switch Online paid subscription to: 1) online play, 2) use QR codes. This is just really unfair.- The increased number of tools. There are way too many tools. I'm of the opinion that a good game has one or two key dynamics and builds around that. But there are so many tools in ACNH that it becomes cumbersome when playing.- DIY CRAFTING OF TOOLS. I effing hate this. Every tool breaks, even golden tools. Then what is the benefit of getting a golden tool? In ACNL, each tool upgrade gave a benefit that made sense in the game. The gold bug net has an increased radius so you can catch rare bugs that startle when you get too close, the golden watering can waters more flowers... There isn't even a way to tell if the tool is close to breaking.- The constant grinding for materials. Because tools break, half my playtime is spent gathering materials. This has a few problems: 1) distracts from gameplay, 2) materials are almost as important as bells coz you need them to craft a variety of things, 3) at least 5-6 spaces in my inventory are wasted on holding materials, negating the increased inventory size- The mileage programme. Like above, it distracts from the game coz in essence you have a bunch of meaningless and repetitive side-quests to do just so you can grind for quite a meager amount of miles (e.g. selling 10 seashells for about 200 miles). Also hate that the island ticket is paid for by mileage- I really hate the new island mechanic. There are no tours, which makes it boring. When there is multiplayer, there's nothing to do. The islands also no longer reliably spawn sharks and rare bugs.- Very difficult to grind for bells now. In New Leaf, a reliable way of getting money was through the money rock/the ore rock and the island, or the Bell Boom town ordinance (where are the ordinances, by the way?). The money rock gives less money now, there is no ore rock, the island no longer spawns rare stuff. Most items also have inflated prices. Flower seeds used to be 80 bells, now it's 240 bells.- Paying bells to send letters. Seriously? Why on earth did someone think this was a good idea? Animal Crossing is about a sense of community that you create in the new island/town you move to. The letter system really gave a sense that you were writing to your villagers and they'd write back and send presents. Also, the villagers don't write back.- THE VILLAGERS. They have way blander personalities. They no longer ask you to change their catchphrase, ask you to run silly errands and run up to you and pester you for something in your inventory. Their dialogue options are incredibly repetitive, where each villager seems to repeat the same 2-3 lines. Even the cute little animations are very repetitive.- Having only 1 island per console. The local co-op system also is **** [link omitted per rules]- Why isn't there an icon on my map for other players who are here?- The merchants. Why is Kicks a wandering merchant instead of having an unlockable shop? Why is the furniture selection at T&T so small, and why can it only be upgraded once? Why isn't there the option to VIEW the wallpaper and flooring I want to buy, in the shop itself, before I buy it?- Only being able to order 5 things from the catalogue. Why the ****TLDR: the game is very beautiful and instagrammable, with some convenient upgrades, but it is mainly incredibly lacking in content, it is repetitive and restrictive, resulting in quite a frustrating gameplay experience. I am still playing because I love decorating and customizing, but it is incredibly unsatisfying.… Expand	2020-03-29

The irony that a family console with a game about family is tearing families apart because of the restriction is baffling. The greed that Nintendo has shown recently is making it so that their image is heavily tarnished. You have YouTubers calling it out, you have review sites calling it out, you have gamers on Metacritic calling it out. There is no winning out of this and if they would like to see the rating of the game that is deserving of an 8 or higher they need to address the issue and either release a patch that makes it so separate accounts can have different islands, or succumb to the fall of the rating of the game they worked hard on.Make your choice, Nintendo.

Something that I love in this game as always in the franchise, is the closeness it has with reality, now more than ever. Time, season (now even choosing in which hemisphere you can place your island) and weather equal to your city's. It also highlights how alive the game is, with dialogues from the neighbors that change continuously (not counting those of the main characters, which are very repetitive) and situations between them, that can make you feel as if you were really inside. Many people are annoyed that there is only one island per console, but not me personally, and that is one of the many characteristics that make the Animal Crossing saga unique. The union and trust between the players who live together in the same space. Despite this, I have to admit that multiplayer on the same console is somewhat messy, since it does not allow the second player to join the game directly and it has to go through a somewhat slow process. In addition to the fact that in order for him to do any minimum action, the first player must change his position as leader, and although it is a simple and fast process, it tires having to do it many times. Still, the control of the character and interface in singleplayer mode is not bad, because I really liked the idea of using a phone as a menu to navigate between the different options. Online mode is better than I expected and is an example of how multiplayer should be on the same console, although the transition between when the visitor arrives on the island and when he leaves can be repetitive when you connect many times with friends, but it is still pretty (somewhat long). As a conclusion, I can affirm that each new day on the island feels fresh and eager to start, although progress can feel slow but satisfactory. The new playable crafting and construction features can appeal to both veteran and new players alike, and graphically as well as musically it is very, very good. I am enjoying and having fun with this game and I hope to finish it completely because I liked it a lot, and it is not that it has exceeded my expectations because it was just what I expected but I do not regret buying it at all, it is highly recommended and I assure that those who play it will like it a lot.… Expand	2020-03-30

The waiting screen is kinda cute, but when you're playing with, let's say, 5 other people, you have to see that screen 10 times per session.2. No bulk crafting/wonky inventory managementAnimal crossing didn't have that many kinds of stackable items before New Horizons, and DS, 3DS, Wii version all had either touch screen or Wii remote which made pulling out items from the stack really fast and convenient, even if you can only remove 1 from the stack at a time. However, in NH you have to slowly remove an item from the stack each time, and the fact you can have 30 woods per stack (and even more for some items) doesn't help here. Also, the problem of slow, repetitive tasks is also in crafting, especially when you're crafting fish baits with manila clams.3. No cloud save (yet)I won't elaborate.4. Game's progression is tied to the first player.Can cause a huge pain if the first player stops playing this game. You should, at the very least, be able to change who's the boss among the players.From here, I'll talk about the problem everyone is ranting about, but personally I didn't have a big  problem with it.5. Local multiplayerThe problem I have with the local multiplayer, is the fact second player don't have access to the tool wheel, and they somehow can't even hold an umbrella. You will have like 6 tools in your inventory and it takes ages to cycle through them. Also, the second player goes HEY I FOUND THIS like Link every time they collects an item, which takes too long if you're picking up several items, like when you're chopping or shaking a tree. Other than that, it's quite fun running around chopping trees and catching fish, wandering around with my sister.6. One island per consoleI understand everyone's frustration about this, but personally, I would like to share island with my family and renovate the island to a beautiful place, where our whole family worked together and have lovely memories about them. The lack of the choice isn't that good, so I'll put this as cons anyway.Now, I won't write about Pros here, but it's overall much better than the last game I've played, which is the Wii version of animal crossing.PSA: This game is NOT all about progression. The progression lies within how the island changes as you put efforts in it, building museum and upgrading resident service is only a part of it.… Expand	2020-03-30

Once downloaded, my brother let me watch him I was so excited seeing him play and I was dying to make my own island. However, I soon realised I couldn't do that. There is a limit of one island to a console. Now I understand the reason. It is a great business technique but it is just unfair. My mum was barely able to afford the one we have now and me and my siblings will not be able to share the one island. It'll cause too much frustration. Resource limitation and progression differentiation is irritating to say the least. Me and my sister won't have the same choices and things that my brother will get because he is the representative. I love animal crossing because it's a chill game. I can take my time and do what I want on my own file. But this makes it impossible to have as much fun as I'd have on New Leaf.

If you can't appreciate a game without clear goals, this isn't the game for you, and that really is okay.  But This experience didn't appeal to me personally doesn't equate to a 1 or 0 score from an objective standpoint.The things you can do as Resident Advisor are completely ancillary to the core experience of Animal Crossing as a whole, and if you really can't tolerate asking whoever you share your ENTIRE SWITCH CONSOLE with to share their island with you, maybe you even have to talk to them every couple of days (God forbid) about building a bridge or whatever you are so desperately missing about being Player 1, then guess what? You WILL have to pay the same premium everybody else does to get the same experience.To cap this off, a HUGE shoutout to people who didn't like the one island system and gave it a fair, measured score based on an incredible game having one thing you personally don't like about it, i.e. 4-6, even a 3 if you just don't like the game.

Don’t be a cuck and let your wife or kids be player one if you’re that hardcore into this E-rated game, and don’t reviewbomb a family game as a grown ass adult complaining that you’re stuck on player 2 and have a hard time sharing with people lol.… Expand	2020-03-30

I don't honestly understand why people are treating it so poorly for it's same screen multiplayer. While I can admit it's very strange, and not well done, people are treating it as if it is something that has been in every game and was ruined in this game. This is the first time that same screen multiplayer has ever been implemented, so it works alright for what it is. The only thing keeping it from a perfect 10 in my opinion, is the fact that others who live on the island other than the first person to move in, can not place things around the island, only in their own home. This takes away a lot of what this game advertises, and leaves the  game essentially New Leaf + crafting. The game is wonderful, and anyone who needs a life sim or something to help them relax from their stressful life should buy this game.… Expand	2020-03-30

There are, however, many things I am disappointed with. For one, many staple NPCs of the series have been cut. Brewster, Redd, Dr. Shrunk, Harriet, Pelly & Phyllis, and Katrina have all been cut. In addition, the art gallery has been entirely cut from the museum. Nook's Cranny now only has one upgrade. There are very few buildings to construct. The amount of buildings and facilities you construct would be equivalent to the amount of buildings and facilities that would be available day 1 in other games. Diving has been removed and the there are now only 6 different kinds of fruits. I am mixed on crafting. On one hand, crafting provides a new and fun way to create certain furniture and outdoor furniture. On the other hand, If you remove the crafting and the nook miles system from the game, this game would have no substance. I'll just put it this way, this is the first animal crossing game where I have had nothing to do except log in, play the game for a total of 10 mins, and sign out. Each animal crossing game released up to New Horizons was a culmination of everything great from the games previous. This is the first game in the series to regress in design and gameplay and that just doesn't sit well with me. This game was rushed and hopefully, with updates, this game can improve, but for now, this game is all style and no substance, and I'll be sticking to city folk or new leaf.… Expand	2020-03-30

Now each player has to compete for resources, land area, everything. The multiplayer option is god awful as well. One player, being the ‘leader’ can play the game normally while the other player is completely helpless. Having a simple fix of a split screen option would fix this so easily.

I let her start the game and enjoy it for a few days before I logged into my switch profile and started my game. I was extremely disappointed to see that it put me on my daughter's island, and I can participate as a glorified visitor. I cannot progress the game in any way. If she collects all the fruit before me for the day, I cannot gather any. As a secondary player, you can basically decorate a house, and interact with the environment, but nothing further. I understand that even if you buy another came card, you cannot have your own island. The only way to do that is to spend $200-$300 for an additional Switch console. And another $60 for a second game copy if you want to play together or at the same time. Seems like a big money grab from Nintendo to sell more Switch consoles. Extremely disappointed!… Expand	2020-03-30

It really pains me to give this game a low rating because honestly it does so many things right.  In truth, this game would definitely earn a 9 or 10 out of 10 were it not for one glaring issue.  The fact that the game limits you to one island per console.  This is bad for so many reasons that countless others have already pointed out. Obviously it means that multiple people are limited to sharing a single experience instead of being able to have their own separate adventures.  But that isn’t really why I am so frustrated by this game.  No, actually my fiancé and I were very excited to build our island life together and the idea of sharing this experience was something we were both super excited for.  The real problem is that WE DON’T get to share the same experience together!  That’s because in this game the only person who gets to enjoy the full game is the person that founds the island.   Everyone else is treated as a second class citizen unable to trigger any of the main progression events and relegated to doing only the more tedious chores the game has to offer.  So many of the missions and DIY recipes are locked away to these players.  I could go on about this forever but to keep things brief, this one flaw in game design has single handedly destroyed our desire to play this game that we were so excited to play.  The only half-viable solution seams to be buying another console (and probably another copy of the game).  Now given the recent collapse of society, switch consoles have become exceedingly hard to come by.  But even if that weren’t the case, I still wouldn’t be willing to buy another system because it feels like that was the entire reason the game was designed in this manner. This feels so scummy and is the worst part of this whole situation.  Really hope that the necessary changes get made but I expect they won’t.  Until then my score stands.… Expand	2020-03-30

It’s a fun game but the multiplayer options for this game when played on the same Switch are ridiculous and warrant a 0 rating. Only the “primary” player (the first player on the island) is able to progress through the storyline and complete certain quests. I’ve been running around the island for three days now and I can’t get an axe to progress further because the primary player of the game has lost interest already and hasn’t opened the axe up in their game. So I have to either log in as them and play as them and do these things or quit. I choose to quit the game. This is a ridiculous way to design a game. I find it mind boggling that developers sat down in meetings during development, discussed this, and decided it was a great idea.  Then that great idea was coded, tested, and still made it into the final cut. How does something like this get implemented?  Have these developers ever played a multiplayer game?  Who actually thinks like this?  Who wants to play a game and be eliminated from content just because they are not the “first” player of the game?  Who tested this feature and liked it?  It’s just dumb game design, period.I have asked for a refund, not sure if it will be approved but the request has been made.… Expand	2020-03-31

These are some things I think they might need to work on possibly adding. 1.) Villagers need more life to them like in other games, I think having quests to do from them would be a great way to have a bond with your villagers. 2.) I know this is what a lot of people are saying but, have more than 1 account for a switch; you could even make it to where it only can be another Nintendo ID to have another island. 3.) The online cut scene for a player arriving to your island is dreadful to watch, at first its cool but then after a while of having to watch it, it is tedious and annoying; especially if you constantly have people joining and leaving. A simple solution could be to have a button to skip or just not have it ( If possible). 4.) More interaction with items, this one could be a simple update to make more of the items have a better interaction with it, such as the Tea-Cups that spin. The game would become more fun and make players want the items more if they have something to do with them other than just for decoration.

But also I am a student who cannot log on all day so I miss certain fish and bugs. With it running in real time it takes real days for jobs to be completed. For example you place the lot for a house after 5am the following morning it will be built. The only real story to the game is improving your house and island. All other aspects are a gathering aspect, as in find resources. When improving your house you don’t get to pick new roof or bigger room it’s a set order each becoming more and more expensive. I understand teaching the player responsibility but playing the game the proper way without exploits (like tarantulas) makes a 2.5 million $/bells loan unrealistic. With loans and things you pick what they are for. I’m also loosing interest because after playing for a week I’m still stuck with an island I cannot customize. I have great plans for what I want but no way to do them. I thought I was buying a game I could sit and play for hours but I don’t see how that is possible when I can’t do anything. I fish and catch bugs with hopes of paying my crazy house loans and for what? Weeks upon weeks before I can do what I desire. Maybe think twice about purchasing it is definitely not worth the hype.… Expand	2020-03-31

What seems absolutely ridiculous is that really only one player is truly playing the game they payed for, while everyone else is stuck being a glorified villager who can upgrade their house. There aren't even ways to get recipes for certain furniture because there is no access to the story or even simple town upgrades like bridges and inclines if you aren't player one! This is ridiculous and Nintendo knows it, especially because these restrictions are not something Nintendo was upfront about because they knew it would hurt game sales. The absolute lack of care for it's customers in this regard is just not something I had come to expect from Nintendo and I am shocked and appaled. I payed for the game too and every player on the system should be able to play regardless of whether everyone is on the same island or not. Either make all players equal or give everyone their own island... because what we have at current is a game thats only fit to be played by player one. While I do understand that Nintendo is attempting to sell more consoles (though that's not even possible at this time due to them being sold out nearly everywhere) they are also selling a product, Animal Crossing is a product that people payed $60 and it CAN be held to the standard that every player in the game can actually... you know... play. Nintendo not being upfront about the fact that it is essentially a game only able to be played by one person oer console turns animal crossing into a **** product for everyone who shares a switch, which might I add with it's multiple accounts per console, was marketed as a sharable family console when it first came out, not something like a ds that everyone was meamt to have their own... I'm just going to be honest, if you share a switch don't get the game, not until something changes. Either you'll be the resident representative and you're family or partner will be stuck being upset amd probably a bit resentful (Ive been in and heard of plenty of fights breaking out over this game in families) or you'll be the second player and will find your gameplay  so limited you'd be just as well off playing the free mobile game pocket camp. If you have your own switch, great, good for you, get the game I'm sure its a blast, if not, maybe get an older edition of the game or wait until its possible to buy another console, or play a game like stardew with a similar vibe to animal crossing.

Currently sharing with 4 family members (5th one pending) and while this game is fun for a solo player with your own island, once you have new players move in, you have to share (Or force others to share) limited resources, creative space, argue over plots of land, villagers and landscaping decisions. You have to greatly modify your play in order to accommodate for others on your island, which may be fun in some cases (co op with your SO) but with kids/others who will ruin things or don’t care about sharing.. your game experience is significantly reduced. Only the first player gets the special missions/rewards and any additional profile that moves in to the island is left in the dark as far as instructions and introductions and additional perks.

Then the island will be open for visitors.The problem is, if you want to do practically anything in the game (send a letter, turn in the daily ghost quest, etc), you have to go back to that NPC, turn off online play (sitting through the same text and screens), just to do that action.  Then you have to travel back once you've done your thing, and re-enable the island.  It's just annoying, tedious, frustrating, and seemingly unnecessary - considering you're always online - case in point, friends can text you on your in-game phone... they just cannot visit you.  Super dumb.Now lets say you want to have multiple people in the house play the game, and each person wants their own playthrough - cannot happen.  The game will literally only let you have one playthrough per Switch, and everyone has to share the same island.  That means a family member can clean the whole island out (smash all the rocks, dig up all the fossils, etc), and when you decide to play later, the island is picked clean.  Not to mention someone can advance the story, and you miss it.  Seriously not cool.  We have 3 people in our family that play the Switch, and only 1 can play Animal Crossing.There are also gameplay mechanics that were badly implemented.  For example, if you want to sell items (which is the only real way to make money), you have two choices: walk up to the store mailbox and sell the items -or- enter the store, wait for the load screen, talk to the store keeper and go through his dialogue, sell your items, leave the store, watch the loading screen again.  The problem is you get 100% of the sell price of your items if you talk to the storekeep, but only like 60% of the price if you use the box on the outside of the store.  They explain the outside box as a way to sell items whenever the store is closed (they are open 9am to 10pm daily), but at the penalty of changing you a heavy fee.  I get why the outside-hours-box charges a fee (even if I think it's a stupid mechanic), but why are they charging me the fee when the store is still open?  Why must I sit through two loading screens and a dialogue tree just to vend my items at full price?It's mechanics like this that really suck the fun out of the game, and turn it into a downright chore.  The novelty of the cute load screens, or crafting animations, or lengthy repetitive dialogue really gets in the way of fun.  Also it loses 4 points outright for the dumb single island mechanic.  Bad job, Nintendo.… Expand	2020-03-31

Now I spend at least a few hours a day on my island. One of the biggest improvements I've found is that it seems that item randomization in the shops and from balloon gifts seems to be more tailored to your purchases that you have already made in the game, so you are more likely to get items that match the aesthetic or set that you are trying to pull together for your house. Maybe I have just gotten lucky, but when I got the game I noticed a lot of other people had really tightly designed spaces that looked great already despite how new the game is. In previous titles I had little incentive to upgrade my house for a while because of how hard it was to get the furniture and items I wanted in the store. Now I am already grinding bells to get more space. The crafting and customization mechanics are also a great improvement, and while tools that break can be a pain, it's a lot less painful to have to drop a flimsy tool to make room for resources than the normal tools in other games.

We talked to Nintendo's support about the problem and they mentioned that the single file system was to maintain the game's artistic integrity.

I can’t make pathways, bridges or terraform at all. I can’t understand why Nintendo has done this Like many others here, I’m really disappointed by the restrictions of player 2/ any player that isn’t the founder. Me and my bf got this game to play together but soon found out player 2 can’t make any executive decisions, doesn’t have access to any of the quests, can’t place buildings/infrastructure, and ultimately misses out on a lot of the story. This sucks!! It means one of us misses out on the full experience of the game. This is unfortunately not rectified by the option for co-op play, which is just a joke. Co-op works by having one ‘leader’ that can play as normal, and then the ‘followers’. The followers can’t access their tool wheel, inventory or leave the same screen as the leader, which just results in really boring gameplay. The follower is just essentially reduced to being a pack mule for the leader, and unable to really contribute in any way, as it takes so long to cycle through your tools to really be able to do anything. It sucks because it would’ve been SO fun to play together co-op, but Nintendo really missed the mark with these limitations. The only work around is to get a new switch and second copy of the game, which is ridiculous! It’s such a shame because playing the game solo has been really great, but the fact that you have to buy multiple consoles for everyone to get the full experience of the game is just terrible, and for that i can’t justify giving this game a good rating… Expand	2020-04-01

There is a one island per console rule and player one has all the control. All materials are shared between players so if you chop up all the wood, hit all the rocks, and dig up anything from the ground... there will be nothing left for player two. Your best bet is to try and save up miles and visit a mystery island... which is annoying as hell. Player two can't help build homes and you can't trade bugs/fish between players either. This all has been very frustrating since my Fiance hasn't had much fun playing alongside me. The game itself has some odd mechanics too. Fishing and digging are hard as hell. There is no indicator that you are facing the right direction so most of the time you end up missing your target. Crafting items is a **** and a half. If you want to craft multiple items, you have to click to craft, watch the animation, then click back in to craft again. Repeat until you build as many items as you want. Super time consuming and annoying. All tools will break eventually, and I wish there was a durability indicator so you are aware when it will break. I do enjoy this game while playing alone, but it's a real bummer that we can't have our own separate islands and have equal participation. If that gets fixed and the other minor things change, I'll be happy with the game, but for now, I am disappointed.… Expand	2020-04-01

What's inexcusable is that only the first player can advance the game forward.	2020-04-01
0	Tuhotulva	The game only allows one island per console, not account, and thus I have to play as a glorified npc on my partner's island. Not cool Nintendo.	2020-04-01
1	Graybie	Wonderful game, except that same-console multiplayer is really broken. I wanted to build an island together with my wife, but only the first player can meaningfully contribute to and progress through the island development. The second player doesn't get the storyline recipes, quests, or really anything to do on their own regarding the growth of the island. Very disappointing.	2020-04-01

1	Computernerd	Inconsiderate game design for families while specially being designed on a console for families. This game is nearly unplayable as a second player. I share my game with my brother who rarely plays which haunts all progression, and he can’t manage deleting his character. I am the one who owns the switch which makes this even harder, as I can’t even buy a new game or a new account for this game.	2020-04-01

3	Emperor_Mercy	I'm going to be completely honest, the game actually looks great. The graphics and gameplay are stunning from what i can tell.However we all know that the one big thing that made me not even play the game at all, is in fact the one island per console limit.

The graphics and gameplay are stunning from what i can tell.However we all know that the one big thing that made me not even play the game at all, is in fact the one island per console limit. What this means is that if you have a family household Nintendo Switch, You ALL have to share 1 island, and if you want another, you have to pay another 350$ bucks. So essentially what happens is if you have switch being shared with multiple people, new islands are behind a 350$ paywall. This is clearly Nintendo's way of stealing money out of pure greed. Please do not fall for this trap, and save your dignity.Now although the problem is still there, it could still be semi-fixed with a co-op run island. However this is not the case. The account who created the island practically dictates all the major decisions. Everyone else is a resident or more properly called the working class who literally does nothing other than doing what the person who created island has already completed.And to top it all off of this crap cake is the fact that you can't back up cloud saves, which means if something happens, that's too bad!If you are one person who owns the console, then congrats and feel blessed.

I was so excited about being able to play together on one island to collaborate and work together. However, as the second person to join I cannot contribute to building new shop or choosing their location. When playing local co-op the controls for both players is reduced, upgrades like item wheel cannot be used, opening your inventory interrupts the other player's actions, like pulling out their fishing line for no reason! The secondary player is trapped in a little-brother mode where they can't even pick up items or leave the view of the leader player. Shaking the controller to swap leaders is helpful but doesn't make up for how limited this mode is.The game is very fun but as the second player I cannot enjoy the game fully. I hope that Nintendo will either improve local co-op by giving all switch users full island access, improving co-op controls and  adding true split screen, or worst case scrapping one island all together and giving all users their own save file.Expecting couples to pay at minimum $560 (2 Switches, 2 game copies, 2 online subscriptions), and even more for larger families, for each person to fully be able to experience Animal Crossing and play together is just absolutely unacceptable and needs to be fixed.… Expand	2020-04-01

So let's just get right into it...1) One town per Switch? Why? GameCube let you have a town per memory card,As a diehard fan of the series, who's sunk hundreds and hundreds of hours into them all, and who STILL plays the GameCube version almost daily since 2002, I'm really disappointed with this one.I'm going to give objective reasons, followed by my subjective opinions afterward. So let's just get right into it...1) One town per Switch? Why? GameCube let you have a town per memory card, and that was almost 20 years ago. Also, why is whoever founds the town, the one who can make the progress in the game?2) Dialogue. It's common agreement in the fanbase that, every AC game after the original has gotten worse with villager dialogue, with New Horizons, it's really hit rock bottom. One liners seem to be the most common response when talking to villagers; Yesterday, one of mine said Today was fun! four times in a row. Are you actually serious, Nintendo?3) Furniture. Where in the world are the themed furniture sets? The different series? The Animal Crossing games' lifeblood is its unique and themed furniture. Yes, I'm aware there are a few out there - Rattan, Imperial, Cute - I may be missing one or two others, but I don't think so, at least not that I'm aware of so far. And seasonal/holiday sets don't count, because they're exclusive to those holidays and events. I'm talking about run-of-the-mill sets you could always hope to find at Nook's, or receive from villagers, and so on. Where's the Modern series? Classic? Cabana? Lovely? Exotic? Why am I seeing, for the most part, the same, or identical pieces of furniture rotated in my (upgraded) Nook's Cranny? It's all the same generic, non-themed pieces with slight color variations - and this also applies to flooring and wallpaper, which seemed to be as generic as they possibly could be. Are sets being added in later? If so, why? Why couldn't they be included as part of the base game?4) House expansion. There's so much extensive customization in mostly all other aspects of New Horizons, yet we have to upgrade our house in a rigid, set-in-stone order. Why? I just wanted to have the expanded central room, with the 2nd floor and maybe basement later on. Such was my surprise when I found out that I HAVE to add a back room, then I have to pay it off and then I HAVE to add the left room, then add the right room, THEN I could have the second floor. Why, Nintendo? In New Leaf, we were given the option as to how we wanted to expand, and the second story was the first upgrade after expanding your main room. I don't want side rooms, why can't I upgrade my house how I want like in the other games? I NEED to know why you've deliberately removed this.**Subjective gripes1) Very few patterns/shirts from the other games, which have always been staples. We're still early into the year and gameplay, so I'm sure they change with the seasons, but so far I've only seen the Misty Shirt and Frog Shirt, as far as staple clothing.2) Totakeke songs shouldn't be buyable from the terminal in the town hall, because it negates any real reason to listen to K.K. play songs and get the airchecks from him, since you can just buy 7 different songs in a week. More, if you're a time traveler.3) Where are the gyroids? Another staple of the Animal Crossing series, completely absent, save for Lloid, and he's not furniture so he doesn't count.4) Art exhibit in the museum - why is it not in the game? Art has been a collectible item in every AC game, yet not only can we not donate them to the museum (the exhibit doesn't exist), but we art pieces aren't even in the game. Not even paintings. Why? I'm sure they're going to be in some DLC down the road, but why weren't they included in the base game?I'm gonna leave it at this, despite probably being able to think of a few more subjective points. In conclusion, this game is fun, it's very customizable for the most part, and there's lots of interesting things to do, but as an Animal Crossing game, it doesn't hold up. There was more to do, collect, buy, etc. 20 years ago in the first game, than in New Horizons.Nintendo (and I'm not afraid to say this) half-assed this game. It feels rushed and very incomplete, despite the fact that New Leaf came out 7 years ago, wherein they had all that time to really make the most amazing Animal Crossing experience ever. They dropped the ball, and as a passionate lover of this series, I'm extremely disappointed, and it makes me really sad to have to say that, not even two weeks after it came out.… Expand	2020-04-01

But while I've grown this game's shallow formula sure hasn't.The co-op is medieval and the multiplayer in general is set up in atrocious fashion. But my main complaint is just that this game really brings nothing over 2012's New Leaf and in fact seems like a step back in places (tool durability? Really, Reggie?). Animal Crossing is a game that has a small amount of quality content parceled out each day, much like a mobile game, which then quickly tapers off to painful grinding. That was okay when I was playing New Leaf on my 3DS on the train or wherever, because I had a few minutes to do meaningful content each day while waiting on other stuff, but as a sit-down console game it's just a waste of time and attention.Even worse in my eyes is how awfully stingy the game is and how strictly it dictates the fun you are allowed to have and when you're allowed to have it. It's like playing a boardgame with a spoiled child who wants to tell you what to do on your own turns. You're constantly being told where to go, which NPC to listen to, what to look at, what your goals should be (regardless of whether you care at all), and then when you're finally let loose it's with a monumental financial yoke around your neck.Honestly this game feels like a huge load. If you've managed to resist the hype please do give it a pass unless Nintendo eventually does some kind of update to fix things (though don't expect the slog to change, that's here to stay). I'm giving it two points because they certainly made an Animal Crossing game, and this would've been hot **** in 2001, but I don't think I'll pick it up again. Which is too bad, because as the Island Dictator, my absentee character will absolutely kneecap the progress my roommate is allowed to make. Great stuff, Nintendo.… Expand	2020-04-02

The sheer amount of stuff you can do in this game is insane, to a point that a completionist like me wonders if you can really do it all, not that it'll stop me from trying! Then the social element with friends makes the experience even better, as the communication with hunting bugs and fish, different stuff to craft, or even the stalk market all make you feel like you're apart of something larger as a whole (even lager than the feeling of your own island community gives you). That's exactly the feeling the developers want you to have with this franchise, and it certainly resonates within each and every one of us. And even simplified, visiting islands and showing off your own is just fun!

This information was announced by Nintendo, has been covered in the media and is explicitly mentioned in the Nintendo E-shop and on the box for physical copies. Review-bombing a game out of ignorance is rather pathetic and it's sad to see such an extremely misleading user score, which hardly reflects the game, merely the frustration of angry fans that didn't bother to read or inform themselves.As for the actual game, it's hardly a secret at this point that it's a stellar game. Arguably one of the best life simulators and in terms of visuals, gameplay and overall feel, absolutely an upgrade over older games. It's a fantastic experience, a perfect game to just relax with and, unless you're a so-called time traveler, a game that will last you for years to come due to absolute tons of customization and options not present in earlier titles.However, not all is perfect and there are a few points of critique I have, mostly when comparing to older games, most of which boil down to missing content. Nintendo's approach to this game is to periodically add updates including new content, which is exciting, but creates uncertainty. Stuff like swimming, the cafe, club LOL, the dream suite etc. all seem to be missing from the game and while obviously not a necessity, I believe many fans would like to see their return or at least an equivalent substitute for some of the features unlocked by some of these facilities. These may be added in future updates, seeing how datamines include placeholders for a museum cafe and even gyroids, but what else will be added remains to be seen.In general, the game is absolutely solid and feels more accessible than ever, as well as being released during a lockdown, assuring tons of hours of fun during these boring times.

Aside from that, I feel like it's lacking even compared to its older predecessors. I was hoping for a greater variety of dialogue with villagers, but interactions are very limited and repetitive. The villagers are the staple of Animal Crossing. I was so excited to finally have a game that would have rich, personable interaction, more villager games, etc. Villagers used to host flea markets and visit your house for fun or vice versa. They used to have interactive aerobics and sports fairs. Now they just wander around and do their own thing, but your character doesn't even have the ability to sit down or join them. I can already predict the 3-5 dialogue options I'll hear each day from every villager. It's disappointing. The lack of amenities is also frustrating. When previous games like City Folk and New Leaf had coffee shops, theaters, and other stores, we were expecting more - not expecting everything to be taken away. Now that I've paved and decorated my town, there really isn't anything to do. I can see that they added the Nook Miles system as a way to keep you busy but most of us aren't interested in doing menial tasks for numbers, we wanted more room for interaction with our villagers and island. Once everyone has played for a month or so, they'll be finding that there really isn't anything to do in this game.

You get to build up your island with amenities and help new animal neighbors move in. However, if you're not the first player (island representative), your gameplay will be limited. You can't help with moving in new villagers or getting shops up and running. You're arbitrarily restricted from parts of the game. You don't get access to crafting recipes or tools you need until player one passes certain milestones. Some recipes are only ever given to player one. And there's no way to have access to the whole game as player two. You have to buy a whole new console (yes, console, not game.) If you're the only person who uses your Switch or nobody else will ever want to play Animal Crossing on it, it's an excellent game.

To call it multiplayer would mean you have some sort of undying fanboy inside youWhere do I begin, no this isn't your regular blind rant of someone complaining about, one switch one island. I'm here to educate you why I chose to give this sorry installment they would like to call New horizons this score. Allow me to elaborate first and foremost this is an excellent single player game. To call it multiplayer would mean you have some sort of undying fanboy inside you telling you that it is. After many iteration this latest installment offers NOTHING and I mean ZERO new concepts, ideas or features involving multiplayer game play. That is what makes this such a lackluster game. I mean you go to a town and then what? Nothing absolutely nothing especially those posh elites thinking that you must do nothing to change a town or even run because it wears out the grass. Why have them over then? To show off your island that was obtained obviously by means of time travel and you have the audacity to set rules on your throne of lies? Seriously if you time travel you are only cheating yourself of the true experience of the game which is to grind and work hard for your accomplishments and should think twice about posting your perfect town for fake internet points. With nothing to penalize time traveler they just ruin the point of the game and finish it within a week. This game offers nothing new compared to the older games in fact the museum received an overhaul on its interior yet there is less to fill it with. Yes that's right because there are no paintings and no deep sea creatures to turn in.Another thing about that. There is still no new additions to the bug, fish and fossils list and that's shameful just going to find the same ones over again with nothing new to find.The crafting system was the most exciting thing I wanted. Until the gimic ran out faster than starting tools could last. Seriously it became more of a chore than a fun feature. There's no insensitive to get better gear if the cheapest one does the same job as a golden version of the tool. And on that note how about you explain why golden tools break? They are not supposed to break they are a symbol of one's accomplishments to obtain them and should not be reduced to the games gimic.Don't get me started with the island tour nonsense. And I paraphrase each island you go to will never be the same as the last so make sure you do everything you can before you leave because we won't be coming back ever yet, there are countless times I've visited the island with the same layout and same island shape and nothing in them. Way to bait and switch the experience of visiting 5 islands on end with slight differences.I'm glad that the events are stowed away so people can't just time travel to get everything off season that's right I'm talking to you time travelers, you're no better than businesses selling their Christmas stuff in August. Boy how hypothetical you all must be.Worst part is that they made a conscious decision to push the game release date further down the to ensure quality yet there is so many bugs in the game especially game breaking. You can lose your save file for popping a balloon in the sky. Yup every time you do that you risk data loss. Tell me again why was the game pushed back? If that was the  choice why wasn't time spent to better multiplayer features. To summarize the game is great single player, terrible multiplayer and so much content is missing the game is bare bones and I'm not talking about holiday things I'm talking about what to do in game. There's nothing to do after an hour of play because the daily chores are completed that fast.… Expand	2020-04-03

I'd love a brochure to sell your island, tell people you have certain things there and be more social with it by showing it off maybe and saying stuff like Hey, I have a tarantula island, come on by!

Everything seems so bare bones for a $60 game.I'd also enjoy it if you had sort've a function to treat it like stardew valley where it had it's own hastened day/night cycle to an extent. I'd like to at least play the game in a few weeks, enjoy all there is to see  and catch/do quests for everyone in that time frame. It's just not there, just nooks increasing debt with everything you do. I get that animal crossing may just not be for me however, I don't think a lot of what I said are bad idea's nor would make people dislike the game any.  Do people really enjoy the game mostly being played only an hour or so at a time and all these things that you probably wont ever get done because you may not be playing in the September time frame to catch certain things?The last thing is the most obvious though. Not sharing your island. Me and my gf share the switch because I barely play Nintendo games and so she somewhat does, so very little reason to own two.

The zen style of gameplay is a nice change from the usual, though I wish they put more thought into this games as the design of some aspects seem short sighted.Most jarringly at first I noticed was the 5am gates. Any time you progress the island a step, the game will lock any further progression behind a 5am tomorrow gate. Mind you this isn't real time, as it will unlock at 5am tomorrow regardless of when you hit the gate. This makes certain buildings a chore, most notably the museum. You get gated after 5 donations to Tom then  after 15 more donations to Blathers, which is then followed by a mandatory 24h construction period. This process takes 48 to 72 hours depending on when you made the first 5 donations, which feels annoying because you need to hold onto any discoveries you find for that time.Next is progression, which for the most part punishes you for doing so. A good example of this is buying from Timmy & Tommy. At the start of the game you can buy & sell from them freely until you get Nook's Cranny. When you do you can only buy & sell normally until 10pm, you can sell using the box at any time with it only being 80% of normal selling price. This detail annoys me so much. If the shop hours was going to be a thing, why not have it always be like that? That way it doesn't feel like they are restricting features or selling for less because you are past the time-frame. The box could have been a positive feature by letting you sell past close time, but instead it's just presented in a way that punishes the player.The tool system isn't much different. Tools break and there are stronger versions available for the right material, but they never change the act of collecting and can actually be a downgrade if the player isn't careful. This can be seen with the iron axe, which doesn't increase the amount of wood dropped and instead will chop down a tree on the 3rd hit, preventing it from growing again and stopping you from collecting wood. There is no reason to use the iron axe over the stone one, which offers the same amount of drops without destroying the source and still offers a fair amount of hits. If you do want to move a tree, just use shovel + fruit which actually put it into your inventory to move/sell.There are other odd details that haven't impacted me much as a solo player being the only one on my switch, but having a single island per console is really not fun since if you want to try local multiplayer you need to place additional tents down on your island to do so. Multiplayer isn't that well explained by the game in general.

Character customization makes your character really feel like you, and allows a whole lot of expression. Local play is new to the series and is decent. Probably the worst new component to the game just because of how it is implemented. And finally custom designs.

Then it dawned on me. I could create an island for me on my switch but who would get to create their island on the other Switch?Draw lots? Choose a favourite child?!Anyway the only choice I was left with was to return both the games as it really would have caused big arguments.So from us that has been a big fail regarding sales and I am not being bitter in saying I hope this doesn’t work out for them and they patch it. It certainly feels like a horrendously corporate, commercial piece of programming. Unless there is sensible reasoning behind it but with expandable memory on the Switch I can’t see what.It may be worth mentioning this fact as I feel it could be a deal breaker for many families considering buying the game.… Expand	2020-04-04

If you had an update with the options of simpler controls and interactions similar to Pocket Camp, the game would be much more relaxing and enjoyable. The other issue is the mystery island AI, there should be a quiz or something at the beginning of the game that is focused on which villager type or style you like because I (and probably many others) have wasted over 20 Nook Miles Tickets and over 40,000 Nook Miles trying to find the villager I want or at least a decent villager to invite. Or the least you could do is make Nook Miles tickets cheaper, or have them be purchasable with bells, because at a certain point it’s hard to get enough Nook Miles. Or there at least has to be a way to invite a villager other than buying an amiibo card.

No backup save, no transfer, no alternative way of getting a different town other than giving Nintendo more of your money during a time like this where we’d all rather save it. Of course there are more reasons to hate this game that has nothing to do with the multiplayer based reasons. Remember ordinances? Gone. Swimming? Gone. Coffee shop? Gone. Completely different areas with unique themes that were really useful? Kinda but not as good as before. Perfect fruits? Gone. Reliable tools? Gone. ‘But tools breaking tools adds challenge!’ Challenge as in being obnoxious? Remember this mechanic in BotW? It worked there because 1. I don’t have to go through the same obnoxious crafting cutscene to make one again and 2. The breaking tools actually encouraged conservation and different strategies to fighting, meanwhile in this game, it’s just a strain on your already limited resources that you get once per day (the survival/resource-scavenging thing doesn’t fit AC at all).

It really feels like you're building something great.Many more residents per island then in the past and more variety when it comes to resident personality.Over all graphics and visual presentation is great as well as sound design.The ability to have local co-op is amazing and something I could've only dreamed of as a kid who I played the original with my brother on GameCube.CONS: One Island per console I know this has been stated to death but it is ridiculous that in this day and age that it's not technically plausible.The restrictions on co-op are a bit frustrating as I stated I'm stoked that they added local co-op but it just sucks they had to make it so stripped..If only they could've added a few more things, I mean simple things like both users being able to manage their menu instead of only the leader that's really all I wish they would've done honestly.. I wouldn't even ask for split screens or anything just the ability for both players to be able to pick up and sell items would've been amazing but instead it just feels like a half measure, it always ends up being a game of watching the leader do things or changing frequently so the other player can get stuff done. Frustrating because it could've been something so great.Animal Crossing is what amounts to be an amazing game, it just struggles on the multiplayer side of things which has never been Nintendo's strong suit except when it comes to local play so how did they mess it up so bad? It's unfortunate because that is what keeps this from being a full 10 in my eyes. It just feels like maybe the local play was a last minute thing they threw in and didn't get the TLC it deserved.

There are some basic things that should be in the game that aren’t and make things extremely frustrating while playing and customizing your island.When placing buildings you can “preview” where the building is going but only in your limited field of view. No overhead map to line object up to get an overall perspective. Even though you get this high point of view when a visitor flies to your island. Hell even grids to line things up would be helpful, since they show grids for the plot on the building being placed but nothing around it.When paying to move a building. If you’re only trying to move a building several spaces to line buildings up, you can’t! Forces you to move it once out of the way and then back again.With the amount of switch shortages across the world and limiting one island per switch makes no sense. Complete greed and not consumer friendly. Even to limit you being able to move your island transfer to another switch is complete opposite of consumer friendly. I have an OG switch and want to upgrade to a new V2 switch and there has not been a good resolution without jumping through hoops and praying I that I will be able to do so.Not even 2 weeks into the game release and the update has replaced half your resources you normally farm with “special bunny day eggs” along with an ungodly amount of recipes for the event. It appears several updates to try and help the situation have been released, but still problem-some. This is a prime example of “always-connected” games gone wrong.Let’s talk about item storage. Why is there not a chest to craft to place outside your home to hold normal items like wood and minerals for crafting? No, I have to go inside my house, wait for a load screen, pick items from storage, craft with an inside crafting table, put things away and then back outside to wait on another load screen. So if an item broke and you didn’t have the resource on you to craft, whatever you were hoping to get will despawn while forced to go in to get items to craft. This is especially painful early on in the game with limited on character storage space.Now onto the crafting mechanic. If I’m trying to craft multiples of the same item and have the resources to do so, why do I have to go through multiple screens and animations to craft the same item over and over? Talk about time waster.One last complaint. I had a visitor come to my a campsite. Not a visitor I wanted, but chatted with them to see what they had to say. My only 2 responses were to offer them a house only island. Could not refuse them coming. Only good news is by a quick search result that I can kick them off later after move in and several days.Don’t get me wrong, the game is fun and offers a lot, but can still be drastically improved on function. Expect a lot of clunky and repetitive animations and not any type fluid gameplay. The game is good by offering things to come back daily and check on resources. But, a lot of free to play games do the same with the same clunky gameplay mechanics. Publisher stepped up the graphics moving from 3DS to switch, but fluid gameplay is lacking for basic mechanics and to keep the game moving forward. The idea of less loading screens to keep the player immersed is something other companies are doing well. This game is lacking that in some key areas as described.… Expand	2020-04-06

Clicking through 8 dialogues, watching an obnoxious cutscene that also plays for ALL other players in the island you go to and not being able to do basic things when your island is open for other players.- The speed at which tools breaks, even the improved ones. Making tools over and over and over get's RALLY tedious after a while.- The placing of items outside your house is absolutely terrible, where you have to hope that you 'aimed' correctly. This get's more apparent when you want to move, for example, a house, and you misplace it by 1-2 tiles, after which you have to pay to move it again.All in all, i have some enjoyment at times in the game, but the mentioned issues really keep me from enjoying the game to the fullest.

Not only do you have to pick a spot to put your tent to live but youAnimal Crossing New Horizons is absolutely gorgeous and relaxing switch game with some minor flaws that hold it back just a bit. The game starts you off from scratch as you have you have to build your own island basically all by yourself with only Tom Nook's small residential services tent in place to get you started. Not only do you have to pick a spot to put your tent to live but you also pick the locations of your first 2 villagers as well as future 8 other villagers as in order to keep with the starting from scratch theme you have to find most of your villagers yourself. Personally, I really like the idea of starting from scratch as it really feels like i have full control over my island and that everything on it has made because of me.The game goes by real time and every single day you have something new to do such as picking fruit from your trees, hitting rocks to get materials such as iron nuggets and filling up your town museum with bugs, fish, and fossils you find. But in order to get buildings such as the museum to access more things you do, Tom Nook gives you tasks every day to help gain the access to new buildings and functions. The game is very relaxing to me as I can just go day by day slowly building up my town but not having to do everything all at once. It gives me a reason to come back every day.The game heavily features a brand new crafting system that use to create almost everything on the island including your own tools. This is where my first small issue is, while the crafting is fantastic and adds to the experience, the tools that you use everyday can break unlike previous Animal Crossing games and it happens enough to be tedious to have to get the supplies and then re-craft them. Also kind of sucks is accounts on the same system all have to share an island instead of getting to create their own. Online multiplayer is a bit annoying as it has a very sluggish start as you always wait a few minutes for a cut scene to play as a new person arrives and even when they are there functions are limited on the island.Though while these issues are certainly a pain in the butt at times it still isn't enough to deter from the lovely relaxing life simulation game that is Animal Crossing New Horizons.

Second there's literally zero new content after you renovate the store ONCE NPCS are nonexistent besides villagers blathers the nooks and isabelle ( i don't count the dodos **** those guys ) like how can you have a 2020 release game have less content than the 3ds game that came out in 2012... wheres brewster wheres gracie wheres resetti?? And that rescue app doesn't count. This game is overall extremely disappointing it pretty much boils down to a happy home designer spinoff disguised as a triple a title.

Where to even begin.For starters, the completely F-U Nintendo gave to fans of people that have multiple family members that play on their Switch is just beyond excusable.  If you aren't the main player account of the switch you a.)  Cannot create a different island b.)  Can't visit anyone online without linking and paying for a completely brand new online account and c.)  Can't actually advance the game AT ALL and have to wait for the main account player to actually progress the game for everyone else.  This is some ActiBlizzard level BS I wouldn't expect from Nintendo, scary sign for things that may be to come.But even if all that were fixed it's still just such a bad game.  There's NOTHING to do here!  Seriously what is there to do?  The crafting system is the most rudimentary I've ever seen in a game, the graphics suck, the dialogue - oh my GOD the dialogue is mind numbingly frustrating.  90% of it is meaningless, but it just goes on and ON and ON AND ON!!  You just sit there pressing the a button over and over again rolling your eyes that you have to sit through yet another endless bit of dialogue that goes in circles and circles, repeating the same thing he's saying over and over and OVER AGAIN.  For instance in a recent update there is a bunny that lets you know there are eggs to be found for a limited amount of time until Easter (or Egg Day as their PC overlords commanded them to call it).  That's all he says in essence, but it takes 20 freaking pages of dialogue going in circles over and over again that you have to sit through for him to say it.And on that note every single npc in this game just has literally nothing to say, like EVER.  No personality, no actual tasks to be done, no real interactions, NOTHING!  It's just such a bad game.  How anyone can enjoy this is beyond me.  Avoid it like the plague.… Expand	2020-04-08

If i'm only going to have two stores anyways, I'd rather play wild world.Being able to customize the island is cool and all, but it really doesn't make up for losing so much of what has made this franchise great. I hope that more of the cut content is added in the future. If we never get more shops, and nintendo items aren't added, I can't see myself playing this game for very long. I'll likely go back to new leaf or wild world.

Well the short answer is no. The reason I come back every day is because you have to, if you want to choose which villagers you have in your town you have to come back every day and hope someone is staying at the campsite as it's near impossible to find them on islands. if you want to fill your house with furniture you actually like you're basically just hoping to get something good in the store every day. If you want something to do you have to hope there's an NPC in the village that day. It's been less than a month since it came out and I'm already just logging on, checking my shops, getting my message in a bottle, collecting my nook miles, and leaving as that's really all there is to do. I cannot decorate my town or my house any more as I've got no more furniture that would look good. I can't get new villagers because they barely show up on islands, I can't progress with the story as the amount of stars your village has depends only on having more villagers (my friend regularly tells me he wishes his island looked like mine, but he has three stars because he has 10 villagers whereas I have one because I have six villagers), I cannot try to grind bells as nearly everything ends up being an egg during this event. There really is absolutely nothing to do. then there's the huge cutscene that means it can take nearly two minutes just to go to someone else's island and every time someone comes to your island you have to stop what you're doing and wait for the stupidly long cutscene, Not to mention the fact you cannot play on two accounts unless you want to share an Island which puts you at a huge disadvantage.

It grades based on the amount of items in the Island, meaning you can just literally fill the island with random items anywhere and get five stars but the island doesn’t look how you’d like it.

I can't enjoy the full experience the game has to offer because of this.I share a switch with other people like many others do and i am also the second player for this game, so this means that I am heavily restricted in what I can do compared to the first person to play the game. I think that this restriction doesn't have a good enough reason that warrants screwing people out of a fun experience and just because the previous games have this same restriction doesn't mean that things can't be different in a modern game like this especially because you could dodge the restriction before with and extra memory card/ copy. Save files are a basic feature in many modern games and they have been for several years now so it would make sense to provide separate progress based on the selected profile.I honestly just don't understand the reason for not making this an optional feature instead of forcing people to play a certain way. As of now though the only way you can possibly dodge this restriction is by buying a new console which isn't available for many people especially when most of them are sold out.Of course though I would love to play this game the way I have played New Leaf before, but the way the game currently stands I am forced to miss out on the fun of the game. If you don't share a switch with anyone and are looking for a relaxing, cute, and charming game to play in your spare time I feel that you wouldn't regret buying this game.

No one can do anything important besides the primary player such as building important bridges or new houses, why? It would be fine if there were more things to do but there isn't. Exploring seemingly random islands and trying to get the biggest payout for every trip can only be done so many times before I get burnt out. Decorating can only get me so far and from what I've heard there are apparently not many furniture options to decorate with. I want to build a town and see new faces besides the two villagers my wife and I first started out with but I can't do anything, there's no point in being a secondary player in this Animal Crossing. If the secondary player chops trees or mines rocks it renders those resources empty for other players for a while, taking away their resources. Besides that, another huge issue I have with the game is optimization issues. Why do I have to eat one orange at a time? Why not give an option to eat a certain number of food items at one time without having to click over and over again and give it a slightly longer animation? The same thing happens with releasing fish; you need to go into your pockets, click on the fish, click release. This for some reason takes you out of the menu to play the same tired animation. Chances are you have more than one thing you want to drop to empty out your limited inventory so you end up going into your inventory several times and it takes way longer than it should. This game does everything in its power to waste your time like clicking through dozens of text boxes to donate anything for instance.

I say this for the simple fact that there is no true multiplayer function that will satisfy everything within the game.  The only person that has any say or control or can actually do anything worthwhile is the VERY FIRST person to start playing the game on the console. Everyone else is literally just a slave to their whims.  i can't even sugar coat it because it's caused no end of anger and frustration for my partner and I when we've tried to play together.  They lost all interest as they literally couldn't progress the story, gain DIY recipes from Tom Nook, nor actually make any meaningful decisions within the Island (such as placing residents or setting up bridges or really doing anything of note at all).  They have stopped playing entirely and that has killed my joy as i'll never be able to play with them all due to Nintendo's greed.  For a company that stresses being the best multiplayer and family friendly console on the market they sure did a good job of tearing families apart with this title.  Like they've got great multiplayer function in almost every other game, yet decided to go money hungry with this entry for whatever reason.  Locking each switch to 1 Island (even if you have multiple ID's with multiple online ability, and even with multiple game codes purchased) is just terrible restrictive and straight up greedy (and i say this as they have yet to offer a valid reason for restricting it in this way so i can only make my own inferences)Understand that I'm not really upset at locking the switch to 1 Island per switch, that actually makes some sense to me.  The reason for the review being this low is the fact that they Advertise this game as a family friendly game, which it is clearly not, What is fun about being relegated to a servant of the first person to start the game?  If they simply added a function to change the Resident Representative in-game then none of us would have reviewed this with such vehemence.Think about this:  If this game was purchased for a household with multiple kids or in a house with multiple roommates that all love the AC series and looked forward to playing this, if for whatever reason the 'main' person who started playing (not even the one who actually bought it because they don't restrict it to actual accounts) was not able to play for an extended period of time, either due to illness, or they were stuck in quarantine at a different location, or they simply stopped playing, then you have effectively killed all progress and joy for the remaining members of that household.  NO ONE will be able to move the game forward so long as that player never plays again.  That is why we are all distraught over Nintendo's decision, and have every right to rate this game as such.  Nintendo never shed any light on this, because had a parent of children, or partner in a relationship known that the others they live with will NEVER have the same ability or privileges across the board then they wouldn't have purchased it in the first place.  Why cause strife intentionally when we're already dealing with everything else going on in the world?So i write this review, not to review bomb, but as a warning for all future purchasers to beware of what they'll be getting themselves into.Now that i've said that, to validate my review i will state that until we discovered this terrible game design decision, it was a really fun and enjoyable game to play, but i will not rate it higher than a 1 until Nintendo even acknowledges this issue let alone be proactive and fix it.  (A 1 because there was enjoyment at one point, but now no longer).… Expand	2020-04-10

My dad, the 3rd person to start playing, earned the gold statue.Fast forward to 2020 - now I'm a dad and I was on the fence about buying a Switch since I've collected quite a few consoles over the years.  I was interested in some of the Nintendo exclusive titles, but when I saw there was going to be an Animal Crossing game on the Switch, I was sold.  Bought the Switch and pre-ordered AC:NH.  Even purchased a Nintendo online subscription to play with remote friends.I kept thinking of how much fun I had playing the Gamecube version, and imagined doing the same with my young daughters and wife.  I really talked it up with them, the fond memories of building a home, seeing K.K. play at the train station.. how we all got statues towards the end of the game.. how much fun it was to play - playing together.Game arrived, and since my older daughter had been good, let her fire it up and make her villager first (a mistake).Things seemed fine, but then.. after a few days I couldn't figure out how to make a shovel.  Or an axe..  seemed odd.  I had paid off my tent loan, had Nook miles+.. bought DIY recipes for a shovel.. axe.. but those required a flimsy axe or flimsy shovel to craft.  I was quite confused.  After Googling.. I was in complete disbelief over what Nintendo had sold me.I fully expected us to share 1 island.  That's how it was on the Gamecube (although you could probably make multiple saves on multiple cards).  I think I would have been disappointed had it NOT been 1 island.  That's sort of the point, playing together, a community.. common good and all that.  Seeing your co-players houses, what they've planted, what's new at the museum etc.AC:NH is a huge disappointment to me.  It's been stated a million times, but only the 1st player - the resident representative - gets a real game.  Everyone else is extremely limited in what they can do.So much a disappointment, I may just track down a copy of the Gamecube game and hope it holds up.… Expand	2020-04-10

I played every game in the series and even as an adult i played new leaf even till this day. Of cause i bought new horizons as soon as it got out andDear Nintendo ( and anyone who reads this),Ive been a fan of nintendos consoles and games my whole life. I had pretty much every console that came out after i was born and I loved them.One of my most loved games was animal crossing. I played every game in the series and even as an adult i played new leaf even till this day. Of cause i bought new horizons as soon as it got out and played it.Sadly new horizons is why i actually write to you guys for the first time.The game looks good and the crafting is fun but the game feels empty, unfinished and lacking. It feels like the bare bone basics of any animal crossing before it and thats it. The multiplayer is seriously lacking and that is for an console that has heavily been marketed as something to play together just unacceptable. Local multiplayer is pretty much just running behind someone and waiting for them to do something . The most i can do with the ones quarantined with me is collecting wood while one hits the trees and the other one picks it up and the worst thing is it doesn’t even go to that persons inventory but to that dumb chest. It doesn’t feel like you did or archived anything as the second player. You cant progress and since the game is so empty and the only thing to do is progress means the game is pretty much worthless if you are the second player.The online multiplayer is better but still boring after a few times there isn’t much to do with the person so it’s mostly just repeating everything you have done that morning on your island on another. I cant imagine why you would go back a step from new leaf there you knew already that there needed to be more for multiplayer and tried to add something.But the worst for me is that as far as i can see ive already ,,finished,, the game. My main motivations to play regularly in previous games were to build out my house completely, to build out the stores and get all the stores and then at last to make my town look pretty. Those where the long time goals, the big goals that stood over the smaller ones.Ive already almost completely build out my house because there is nothing else to do in this game than grind for money.In comparison it took me years to get to this stage in previous installments because there was so much more to do.As far as i can see ive already hit the top on the nook shop. There doesn’t seem to be another upgrade as far as the Internet can tell me.And the only thing thats left is making my town pretty and im already almost perfectly happy with everything on that front.When i started this game it felt abit boring at first because there wasn’t much to do right at the beginning it was slow. Something that already put off one of my friends that bought the game.  Then after it picked up a bit i was so glad because i thought this was going to become great. But now after such short time i already have done what i can do and the daily chores have become kinda meaningless.Even if in updates you guys add stuff that had already been in previous  games what motivation do i have to not play around with it for alittle bit and then put it down again? My town is already build all around the limited buildings that are in the game now. Getting rid of everything and terraforming it again will be a chore and will probably make any much needed content thats added less enjoyable.And when you guys now slowly add the stuff that should have been in it from the beginning will you even bother to put in something new?It makes me so sad and angry to leave such a bad review on the game. Because i love the game, i love the characters and im sure the people who worked on it put their heart into it. The items look gorgeous the characters and environments too. But the game is empty and it feels like there wasn’t enough time so it got sold unfinished in the hopes that nobody would play through the first part before it could get fixed up into an actual game.And it pains me so much to say this but i dont know if its worth the money it costs.I wont be telling my friends to buy it. Maybe ill tell them to wait until it actually gets made into a full game. I hear all the time that it will probably get updates that will ad in more. But for me putting out a game that feels unfinished is unacceptable. Updates shouldnt be there to make it a complete game but to add extra stuff to expand the lifetime of a game.Im more than disappointed im heartbroken.I hope this gets to the ones who can actually change anything about animal crossing/ the strategy that is currently used on this game.… Expand	2020-04-10

And I think that is the inspiration for the shared island game design. Even when one isn’t playing, you can see traces of their play session or they can leave nice messages, etc.The game is literally called “Animal Forest: Come Together” in Japanese. It’s about working and building an island together. Isolating each Switch user on a desert island goes against that principle, of course that isn’t a feature. People that accuse Nintendo of making a cash grab are missing the point entirely. They are the type that like to characterize companies as big, money grabbing entities. Without thinking maybe, just maybe, these talented developers might have made those design decisions for other reasons. It seems to me many western gamers feel entitled and want every feature exactly how they want it.People be so angry and review bombing left and right.

In addition to that I found single player rather pointless and cumbersome. Selecting tools, crafting, managing your inventory are all much more of a chore than they should be. The NPC's are all very boring, just wandering around all day and coming out with the same stock answers. Crafting your own furniture and items is pointless if you can't actually interact with them. What's the point of crafting a musical instrument if you can't use it? Why bother with a mirror if you can't see your reflection? Instead you just spend your time gathering resources. It's not that I dislike games of this genre, per se, but with Animal crossing you start off on such a tiny island with so little to do that's interesting I am really struggling to see why there are so many glowing reviews. Stardew Valley is a hundred times better than this meagre offering and that's an indie game developed by one person.… Expand	2020-04-11

I wanted an app long before an AC app even went into consideration and as soon as the switch came out I waited. And waited. And here it finally is!!! Beautiful graphics, wonderful old characters, amazing new mechanics, a perfect game, as expected. If you live alone... Some people are saying that Nintendo did this out of greed but I wonder if it wasn't to try and force a style of gameplay on us they want us to use. If so, it's childish and controlling and petty. If not, then yeah, it's greedy. People aren't happy with this not because we can't get along and learn to coexist, but because exploring individual freedoms are what creativity, and therefore this game, are all about. I let my boyfriend play instead. I've already had many great experiences and I wanted this one to be for him, but after 275 dollars for the switch and then 60 for the game, I shouldn't HAVE to sacrifice like that. Nintendo has a pretty solid track record of having great ideas and then ruining them. And you'd think that because of the switch shortage from the virus that this would be as good a time as ever for Nintendo to let it go and let us have our own islands since no one can really find or afford another 300 dollar console to play on. Not that they should have to. I'm surprised people haven't resorted to stealing them out of spite. Even if Nintendo had the dignity and wisdom to fix this mistake, the game is still ruined for me. That first time experience of opening up the game and discovering all it has to offer was smeared the first time I logged in as player two. I'll never have that back. I feel resentful and angry and disappointed. I keep seeing other people play their games on my social media feed and it's frustrating.

Han logrado cosas que realmente creo que eran muy necesarias, como el de colocar objetos tanto dentro como fuera de la casa.Hasta ahora, la profundidad de los animales ha sido muy satisfactorio. Recuerden que el juego básicamente es como un simulador de vida y los animales deben sentirse únicos y no como bots a como pasó con New leaf, que se les sacrificó por temas de poder mejorar otros aspectos como el de los proyectos municipales.No comprendo la queja de la gente con el tema de la isla.Influencers de youtube, por no decir POSSERS que jamás tocaron un AC en su vida, dijieron que querían más gente para el online en la isla... le dan hasta 8 y ahora se quejan del online. ¿De verdad? Era obvio que iba a pasar eso, basta que alguien tenga mala conexión para que se arruine la experiencia, así que nintendo, que mucha gente pida algo no implica que siempre sea lo correcto.Era muy obvio que eso iba a ocurrir.Ahora con lo de la isla... ¿Amigo, alguna vez jugaste un AC anterior??? De cuando que en una consola puede hacer que exista un terreno o isla para cada usuario o aldeano? JAMÁS.Obviamente el encargado de la isla (el primero) tendrá los privilegios a como el alcalde del ACNL.¿Por qué la sorpresa? La respuesta es clara. JAMÁS JUGARON ALGÚN AC y sólo lo hicieron porque para hacer videos para youtube o por la moda, por no decir POSSERS que no saben nada de la franquicia.Ahora ojalá nintendo pueda habilitar en un futuro parche el que el alcalde o encargado pueda otorgar permisos mientras se juegan entre varios.Lo que no me gustó es que ya no hay música entre horas. Era algo mágico dependiendo de la hora y el tiempo (clima) y ahora al parecer es siempre la misma, salvo lo cambias con canela??Eso me dolió, deberían de haberlo dejado como siempre y al menos dar la opción de que suene una canción siempre cuando se quiera en algunos casos.Son cosas que a futuro pueden ser mejoradas con parches y actualizaciones, así que no tengo miedo en que nintendo haga esas cosas a futuro.Es muy bonito juego y los fans reales del AC estamos contentísimos.Me llegará hate por parte de algunos, pero la verdad duele dicen, sorry si les he ofendido.Si eres nuevo en esta franquicia, tendrás la suerte de jugar al más completo de todos los AC que te prometerá horas infinitas de diversión y customización.

As the game advances with the real-world clock, every day brings an abundance of new things to experience.

Experience diverse seasons that bring a variety of fish, bugs and fossils to collect and fill a breathtaking museum with. Furnish and customize your home exactly the way you want. Shape the island into your own happy place. The feeling of joy and childlike wonder this game evokes makes this game a must-have. However, the flaws with this game shouldn't be overlooked. Every Switch is interconnected to an island, meaning there can be only one island per system. While in theory this allows for people to join together in creating an amazing shared island, giving only the first player the power to really advance is a huge misstep. It makes the other players feel more like visitors that equal players. That being said, everyone is still able to create their own stories, homes, and connection to the game. it's not enough to darken the overall experience. All in all, this is the brightest and most innovative the Animal Crossing series has ever been. This is a game that thrives on moments, big and small. It manages to make the time-consuming and monumental parts of the game feel earned and worth the effort. At the same time, the lovely presentation and addictive gameplay allow the little moments to feel just as meaningful. It's a game that'll turn any grey day into a sunny one.

Even the cost of another Switch factored in (plus all the other games you'd play on it and be entertained by), it is still a great deal.  The single island thing is definitely a cash grab move, but is still better than most companies doing the micro-transaction thing.  The hours of entertainment involved with modern systems/games far outweigh the cost involved (when compared to other types of entertainment, such as movie theaters or dinner or theme parks, etc etc).Actual criticism about the game itself:I don't like that when you BUY stuff you get a chance to buy something else without restarting the conversation, but when you SELL stuff, you can sell that one thing and then have to start the conversation over.  Only a minor annoyance, though.I wish that in the out-of-doors, you could get an idea of where you're about to set an item down (and how big of a space it needs).

Now whilst this is an incredibly valid issue with this game. I realise it may not apply to a large subset of players. On the other side there is a lot of very high marks from people that don't care about that.I felt I wanted to give a more full summary and review of this game, to give those that probably sit in the middle of not being a long time fan, and having played this game for the first time, like me. I've put in roughly 50 hours into this game. With only 2 days of time travel done at the beginning to speed up the nothing you can do in the first 2-3 days of owning this game.Effectively, the good parts. Nintendo, as always are very good at creating charming worlds. Filled with lovely character, and look really nice. The graphics are wonderful to behold. One fo the best aspects of this game in my particular view is the designing as pects. There is a lot of items and a lot of ways they can be utilised to make unique little biomes for yourself to enjoy and feel creative. I had a lot of fun organising my house.Beyond that though. There really is not a whole lot to do. Once you've built the shop/museum and got a few rooms of your house. This game gets insanely repetitive. The game becomes, pick fruit. fish a little, dig your 4 fossills(which, you run out of unique ones super quick). Hit some rocks, and buy some of the new clothes. Slowly making money to add a new room to your house. It's rinse and repeat of that, for about an hour every day as once you've completed that routine, there is nothing else to do.The big thing is that i was doing all of that, to get the terraforming. I spent an hour a day doing this repetitive nonsense so I could terraform and really make the island my own. when I finally got terraforming. I finally had to go, yep that's enough for me.See here is the big major issue with this game. The repetitive stuff, lots of people can look past. they find it relaxing and stress free, a nice mindless task to focus on and remove the pressures of life from. Me, I don't really get it, I like being creative, so that's why I stuck to it. The thing is though, that Nintendo seem to be stuck in the early 90's when it comes to game mechanics. There are so many barriers in the way of you trying to enjoy this game to the best of its ability. The constant repetition of dialogue, the inability to organise your inventory properly, the inability to build more than one item at a time, or buy more than one item at a time- which is annoying in the Nook atm machine- but ten thousand times worse when at the Abel sisters house and you have to keep walking in and out of the dressing room if you want more than 1 shirt at a time. The seemingly no reason for why trees wont grow. The multiplayer is gimped hard too, Nintendo and internet simply do not work. You want a friend to come over. Cool, go to the airport and open your gates, hidden behind 10 mintues worth of dialogue. Jesus Christ Nintendo, allow me to have my gates open at all times, or at least allow my friends to request to come over through the use of the Nook phone. A quick invite and join system through the phone. But no, it's a whole infuriating process- even after they've visited the first time and become a best friend. Either Nintendo are incredibly incompetent at game QOL, or they know how to fix these things and don't in order to artificially increase game time, because they know how little actual game-play there is in this game.Terraforming, is without a doubt one of the most poorly implemented mechanics I've seen Nintendo create, and I genuinely don't know if this game was actually tested properly. Because it is a joke. There is no marker for where you are creating, and it will constantly, and randomly, without any logic choose a different square to work on, regardless of if you do the same action. On top of that, you will either fill land in, or remove land, with the exact same button- use the rest of the buttons Nintendo. One for filling one for removing land. How insanely hard is that to think of. Forcing you to work several times on the same squares because of the lack of any guidance and logic to the system. This game reeks if eitehr laziness or incompetence. I don't know which, and I don't much care. But this game is not even close to being perfect, and has a lot of work needing to be done on it to make it beyond a 6/10.TLDR; Had some fun with creating, but there are way too many terrible UI/Game mechanics, and repetitive annoying dialogue to allow me to think it is a good game.… Expand	2020-04-12

In fact have one island per switch is the best part, I have 3 other people on the same island and it is nowhere near crowded. having 3 of my siblings makes it feel more like home, being able to trade and help the rest of my family makes the game even more personal. it even got my mom interested interested in video games and overall has helped my family grow closer.

Playing it made me feel even more stressed out and anxious, It's an empty world with a cast of empty characters that make you feel even more lonely and stressed out and empty.Why would you want to spend your time in a soulless world where NPC's don't care about you? They can add yearly updates all they want but it won't make up for the fact that it's a dreadful game. If it's made out of greed and to maximise profit, it shows because it's sort of try to please everybody world, with no soul, just polished graphics.NPC's are cute but, as other people already noticed, they have no soul or personality, they are just there with same old bilge they spew every day.I don't care how much corrupt media outlets say how it's a wholesome game but there is absolutely nothing wholesome spending your time in a soulless world, where all you do is grind, and spend time with villagers who don't care about you.That's sinister, not wholesome.2. Speaking of sinister, Nintendo did a bang up job marketing this as a family friendly game, when all it does is increase domestic strife, arguments, and stirs up families fighting.3. Media outlets who gave this 9/10 are obviously corrupt and have never heard of journalistic integrity.You'll just feel bad reading or watching people rate this WHAOH 10/10 when deep down you know we are going through MAJOR crisis of journalistic integrity (there's none) and social media-influenced outright lies.We read reviews to make an informed choice, not to spend 300 bucks per console and 60 bucks for game.It makes me sick how dishonest these people are.Pocket Camp was free and micro-transactions were an option and as far as I can tell, it did pretty much the same thing (and more) than this hollow product. But this is 300 $ per console + 60 for a game, and fighting with your brothers and sisters + feeling used by a greedy company.I think a lot of people are afraid to be honest about how they feel about this because of hive-mind mentality that's been going around, but your soul and your relationships are worth much more than this game.No game is worth your mental health and friendships breaking up and family arguments.

Okay so you have to share an island, thats not bad it was for couch co-op anyways. Then after starting to play you realize that the first player is the resident representative so basically they get the full game experience. Every other play: does not get to create their own island, can not place and buildings, terraform or do anything of any importance to the island they are forced to play on, they do not get key recipes they will need to make basic furniture for their house that the first player gets, they cannot advance the story past what the first player advances the story to. Again, this game design has clearly been made to sell customers on more consoles, it feels very deliberately restrictive to all players but the first. It has intentionally made couch co-op a disappointing, shallow experience. I would not recommend you spend your money on this.

It has great online play and the visuals just feel extremely nice,  although a bit more of the gridlocked side. Villagers are all super friendly, albeit, a bit boring with their repetitive dialogue types. The small attempt of a story or some sort of plot is welcoming and very unobtrusive to the main aspects of the game. Not to mention, the Nook Miles program gives such a great incentive to keep playing the game, and just using every feature the game has to offer.Some things noticeably offputting- which does have a load of the fanbase lowering their reviews- is these things listed:-While you can speed through crafting animations, you can't essentially just skip the entire animation.-You can't craft multiples of things all at once, therefore having to go through tedious crafting sessions.-As mentioned before, dialogue with villagers still remains seriously repetitive, including main npc characters (Nook, Isabelle, etc...)-Local multiplayer is tedious, especially doing the follow the leader with other players. It's terrible and not incredibly fun.-The game being locked to one island per console is relying on a relic system from the past which should've been obsolete by now. Furthermore, players who aren't the leader of the island cannot progress through the story until the leader player does. For a game that advertises multi-user friendliness, this drawback really drains out that aspect.Although these are some unfortunate drawbacks overall, the game is still super good and has lots of growth potential.

While Nintendo mostly pulls this off but there are a few things that bring this title down.Story/World#DashReviewsIntroAnimal Crossing: New Horizons is the console follow up to the critical apprised portable outing, New Leaf. Nintendo has hit most Switch outing out of the part, so hoping the Animal Crossing would go leaps and bounds beyond previous titles is to be expected. While Nintendo mostly pulls this off but there are a few things that bring this title down.Story/World Building – 3/3This topic a bit hard to talk about due to the nature of Animal Crossing. There is not much of a story so everything comes down to the world-building that is used through characterization and everything that happens within the world. Characters are varied and fun to interact with. You normally don’t see the same dialog twice. You feel like you’re having real conversations with neighbors that live next to you. Fleshed out characters help motivate you to keep building your island so all your virtual friends can have their best lives.Gameplay – 2/4While there nothing inherently wrong with the gameplay, flaws start to show their ugly head once you start playing for a long period of time. Everything from fishing, collecting items to use for customization, crafting items, and shaping the world to your liking works well. The problems come in with the slow archaic menu system. It takes forever to craft items, selecting multiple of the same item, and talking to villagers for options. The option to fast skip text or being able to choose multiple of the same item would help tremendously. Online play is even more restrictive. It’s fun to hang out with friends but you are locked out from almost everything you can do on your island when someone else is visiting. You even have to watch a 30-second cutscene every time someone comes or leaves your island, stopping you from whatever you were doing. I think everything else works well with new additions such as terraforming landscapes and crafting items, which are great additions but changing the menu systems would greatly improve the overall package.Technical/Performance – 3/3Nintendo must have put a lot of time into the visual aspect of this game because for a game that focuses on cartoon looking animals, there are so many jaw-dropping models scattered throughout this game. Decorative items, fossils, fish, and bugs all look stunning. They mesh well with the cartoony aesthetic of the game and make it all the more satisfying to build your island. The soundtrack is pretty good albeit a bit repetitive at times. Nothing terrible but nothing outstanding. If there is one aspect that Nintendo is good at, it’s the technical side of their games.VerdictAnimal Crossing: New Horizons will please fans of the series while welcoming newcomers all the same. It’s a fun game for all ages that don’t mind playing a game with a slower pace. There is always room in the gaming market for a game like this but I would like to see menus be a bit more intuitive so I don’t have to spend 2 hours doing something that should have taken half that time. I recommend a purchase at full price if you are a fan of this style of game. If you’re not big on life simulation games or don’t have the time to play, you can wait a while before picking this one up.… Expand	2020-04-15

For each player in a household to have the full experience, you would need to spend $408AUD per person ($79 for a copy of the game, $329 for a Nintendo Switch Lite). Safe to say, no game is worth $408.Here are some of the features that players 2 to 8 on a single game miss out on: Story elements, bundles of free recipes, and island editing tools (infrastructure projects, moving buildings/houses, terraforming).This would be the equivalent of BotW only allowing the first person to boot the game to fight the Divine Beasts and Fight Ganon, but allowing all other players to collect hearts, stamina, and resources for player one.Or, it would be the same as only allowing the first player to boot up Super Mario Odyssey to collect moons, while every other player could only collect coins.Furthermore, none of the promotional materials, nor any reviews of the game have indicated that collecting all the materials within the game is capped for anyone looking for a purely single player experience. As an example, a single console and island has access to a maximum of half the fruit species available unless they engage in local co-op with another owner of the game, or subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online. Datamining revealed that players visiting Mystery Islands will only be exposed to their Native Fruit, and a Sister Fruit. No matter how many Mystery Islands you visit, these will be the only two fruits you'll be exposed to.The shady nature of the promotions around collecting, combined with the lack of autonomy given to all players beyond player one, is why this game is getting slammed by players. That is why such a beautiful game, with addictive gameplay, does not deserve the full praise it deserves, when it is so clearly trying to force people into purchasing multiple copies and consoles to fulfil the experience.… Expand	2020-04-15

But the current system in which the island's progress is completely tied to the progress of whoever the first player on the console is is absolutely ridiculous.  There's no need for it in my eyes, I can't see any reason why it should have to be this way; I don't want to be cynical of nintendo, but it honestly feels like a move to sell more systems--simply because I can't fathom any other reason that would be necessary.Personally speaking as a player 2 on the island, it feels like I have no point in playing.  I don't get assignments from Tom Nook, which means I don't get any recipes like my P1 does; I also don't get to invite citizens to the island, or plan infrastructure, or make any decisions.  Basically I'm playing home decorator 2020, because I can't contribute anything to the island aside from paying money towards bridges/stairs and throwing some furniture outside.Hopefully the devs catch wind of the review bombing and seek to patch this out sooner rather than later.  Again, being on one island is fine, but having no options to contribute as player 2 is ridiculous.  Its as simple as giving P2+ the options to change infrastructure and invite settlers; and if you're worried about doubling-up missions, just have Tom Nook announce that someone else is working on an assignment for him already, and then have him lay out what the assignment is and give the recipes needed for the other players to help.… Expand	2020-04-15

You can’t play on other islands with other players either which is so lame.

You should look at this game for what it is in total.  Animal Crossing:  New Horizons is a very enjoyable life sim.  It could even be called the greatest Animal Crossing game out there.  The basic principles in this game are the same as the other games.  You pay off debt, do daily tasks, get villagers, catch bugs, and all the rest.  Like in New Leaf, you can make stuff like bridges and ramps.  However, New Horizons adds new customization to your island.  In this game, you can move buildings around and decide where all of the buildings get built.  Crafting is new, and it is a very nice addition.  You can only craft one item at a time, which sucks, but having the ability to make stuff is a welcome feature.  This game is amazing, and you will spend hundreds of hours into it without realizing it.  So don't listen to the 5.2 user score on this website;  It's the result of a bunch of angry people bringing a great game down for a petty reason.

Considering almost all of the reviews on here are about the inability to create multiple islands on one console, I won’t cover that (and it wasn’t an issue for me, as I’m the only person who uses my Switch). However, I have a lot of other disappointments. I won’t go over the things I love because the critics covered it all—everything they said is definitely true. This is by far the best Animal Crossing yet, despite the huge flaws. I’m very disappointed to see that there’s no way to access your storage outside of your home. The storage is much better than before, don’t get me wrong—you can store much more, and the game auto-sorts your stuff for you. Character customization and clothing customization is far better than ever. But when you add crafting, several things need to be changed. Even in previous games, you could access your storage through either the post office or train station. Considering you can place items which used to link to your storage (dressers, chests, etc) out in your island now, why can’t you use those to access storage? I know this wouldn’t be “realistic,” but Animal Crossing isn’t exactly about realism. The multiplayer is clunky as hell, too. Connection has been pretty bad every time I play, and the longass animation whenever people join or leave is AWFUL. If you want to play with more than one friend at once, you’re out of luck. Not to mention that if someone tries to leave, and others don’t “close their windows” (aka, menus or conversations), a ten second timer will tick down. If it hits 0, the person trying to leave will go home with an error code and lose EVERYTHING they did while on the island, as well as everyone else losing what they got while interacting with the player. This is absolutely horrendous and makes no sense to me. Players can essentially sabotage others if they want to using this. Also, the restrictions on what you can do while others are over is annoying. Why can’t I rearrange furniture when someone’s over? Why can’t I order catalog items? It’s infuriating, particularly the inability to move things around your island or home. The crafting system and shops also sorely need updates. Why can’t I craft more than one thing at once? Why do some of my DIY recipes require that I know other DIY recipes? Why can’t I use a slider to buy however many flower seeds I want, like when buying turnips from Daisy Mae? Why can’t I buy more than one shirt or pants at the Able Sisters? It never feels good to sit there and watch the crafting animation 30 times in a row because you’re just trying to make fish bait to catch a rare fish. This should be much, much easier to do. There are some little improvements I love—the drop-off box for selling items is great, and I like the way flowers are handled, as well as the terraforming. But why are custom paths still able to be destroyed with the B button (the same button for picking up items, mind you), and why can other people destroy them? If you’re going to add paths to the game, and the ability to literally pave custom paths using this path tool, why don’t they act like paths? The game is certainly not worth a 0/10, it’s fantastic, but all of these small issues are a huge disappointment.… Expand	2020-04-16

It's gone. Congrats. And the one island-per-switch choice is moronic. If you are a parent thinking you can get this and enjoy playing with your kids but having your own island - you're SOL.But if you want, I can still come visit your islan- hold on a second. The game needs to pause every time someone leaves or enters your island. So if you just got some killer turnip prices or a meteor shower and want to make some money from people visiting...um, good luck with that. It's fantastic gameplay, lemme tell you.However, what makes this game so bad goes far, far beyond that. You get a dialog popup for. EVERY. SINGLE. THING. THAT. YOU. DO. Caught that same fish for the 100th time? Let me give you a dialog box! Want to visit another island? Here's 10 dialog boxes for you! Want to craft an item? Here's 5 dialog boxes for each item you want to craft! Did you close that dialog box? Here's another one for closing it. So much time is spent on stupid aspects of the game that are simply - dumb - design decisions.By the way, you'll be crafting each item individually as there's no bulk crafting. Fishing is annoying as the timing of when fish change directions is almost exactly the same as the time it takes for each cast. NMT islands get boring incredibly fast. This game repeatedly feels like a free-to-play game because at multiple points, you cannot progress until a day passes.I've played life sim games like this. At this point, I'm wholly recommending you play Stardew over this game. It's cheaper too, and the dev will straight up respond to your suggestions or bug reports on Twitter.

By the time I was done with those and got access to the new terraforming feature, I was completely exhausted to the point that I don't feel like playing this anymore. Having to replace broken tools every five minutes certainly doesn't help.All of that wouldn't be so bad if the villager dialogue wasn't (against all odds) even worse than in City Folk. I've been playing for a couple of weeks, and have already heard the same lines about 'digging up fossils yesterday' nearly a hundred times. Dialog is more generic than before. For instance, the villagers say that 'you wear that a lot' about everything as opposed to the previous AC games where they'd comment about WHAT you're wearing, etc. And while you can now place furniture outdoors, these too get generic responses from the animals: 'who put a drinking fountain outside? That's so weird'.In short, New Horizons is tedious, and I can't see myself playing it for more than a couple of weeks. Not when I could just play Wild World or New Leaf instead, either of which are much superior to this in everything but graphics.… Expand	2020-04-16

At the same time correct and incorrect. This is from a time travellers perspective though.For time travellers they are able to skip to any day of the year and be able to catch fish/bugs that are meant for that time of year. Games come out so frequently nowadays that you could end up forgetting you even have Animal crossing to play when another game comes out that your absorbed into. So being a time traveller you can put so much time into the game so quickly and be able to get as much possible from it without having to do so much waiting. I Time travelled and i sunk in an easy 100 hours doing stuff and enjoyed most of it. From doing all this i found some stuff that could affect a casual non TT playthrough.The waiting days has been in since the begining but in this game its next level, theres alot more you have to wait days to do. Which means alot less of being able to play while waiting for these. Everything is IRL time based, so its not even like you can spend time trying to finish your collections because you have to wait for that during times of the year. So combining it all it just makes less to do rather than more. Its more over time, this game is perfect for you if you can only sink in a couple hours a day. Its really not even hard to get money in this, so you can do everything you need to do in a couple hours each day. Theres no more burrying your shovel to get golden either with this new recipe thing, so you now have to do something that comes randomly each week and you have to do it 30 times. Which is another you having to wait day by day to check if that persons there. The amount of waiting you have to do has been increased by around double, which imo isnt a good thing as like i said games come out alot and you can just end up forgetting about your island. I never felt like this in the past couple of games and they still had all this in, just less of it.The local multiplayer really needs some work for the next game, should be two completely different save files and only join each others island if your both logged in at the same time and P1's island is the one you go to. I don't really local multiplayer though so this doesn't really affect me as much.All that really comes down to this is there is just alot more waiting in this one and for someone that wants to spend 10 hours on this with a day off work. You are going to get bored as the game is constantly at a dead end. Someone that can only fit in a couple hours a day this is perfect for you.… Expand	2020-04-16

Stardew Valley leaves a lot to explore and do!the controls aren't nice. I don't like how you have to wait for the flowers to sparkle to tell if they're watered . with a lot nearby it's not a nice way. a lot of the mechanics like donating to the museum feel so unrewarding. I feel no reason to do it. unlike stardew valley that I donated every first of any item I got there.stardew valley is simply 20x better and costs less than half as much when not on sale.it started of very fun but they haven't managed to make the tasks rewarding. there's just something about the animations the speed of them and the rewards that you get for them that makes this game not fun. and I LOVE games like this. farming stuff and the type where you get stuff and unlock more new stuff. this is my fav genre of games so it's not a I only like call of duty kind of issue, They just haven't made it work well for me.

The concept itself is great but the execution is just terrible.  This game was released before it was finished.  Its as simple as that.  This is not a complete game.  There isn't really any campaign which is just preposterous. It would have been so easy to send your character on a variety of cute quests to help the islands residents, but no... Everything about this game, aside from the graphics need to be refined.  It feels like no one tested this game before it was released.  There is a long list of issues that should have been fixed prior to release.  No option to craft multiple items (unbelievable).  Not enough resources to craft things (even if youre prepared to grind).  Terrible controls for building (its a crafting game but you feel very limited in what you can do and where you can place things).  Not enough quests.  Seriously just preposterous.  Even the mobile version of this game has better quests.  All you do is keep paying off enormous loans to build up your house, its just an endless grind that isn't very creative or innovative.  This game is the definition of half-baked. I wont even get into the fact that its only one island per console.  In my opinion Dragon Quest Builders II is a much better game if you want to play a crafting type game.  There are just so many things about this game that aggravate me when its being touted as a game that is enjoyable and relaxing.

As it was in New Leaf where you could make public structures, like arches or statues, now they're just items like it should have from a long time ago. Another good addition is its new point system called 'Nook Miles' in which you have to meet certain requirements like achievements and you'll be rewarded with miles, this system comes as unique achievements and a daily wheel of minor achievements that can be done over and over, in contrast with past entries where at a certain point you simply turn off the game because you didn't have more things to do for that day, these miles can be exchanged for several things like furniture, clothes or unique DIY recipes, this new mechanic in form of DIY is easily one of the most enjoyable things in NH, they come as gifts from villagers, message bottles, rewards, etc, the fun part is that you need certain items to make them, so a lot of your time will be invested in acquiring items to make your recipes, pure joy.By far, the best thing that NH has to offer is terraforming, although it has its limitations, it's easily the most entertaining addition: do you want to make your island like a crater? maybe a fortress? or how about a city? the limit is your determination and creativity (and maybe at times money), but it surely is the thing that a lot of veterans were waiting, think of it as a Minecraft ripoff, but with Animal Crossing makeover.As for the negatives, there are a lot of issues that can be resumed into 4 main problems, at least to me, they weren't a problem at first but everything went a little downhill once you notice them. First and the most common issue for everyone is the one island per switch, when the official trailer launched and stated that this game will be multiplayer with a common island I was really into, I and my partner were daydreaming about the things and possibilities of playing co-op, turns out that the local multiplayer is more a gimmick and the second player is basically a background PC, although the biggest issue is that the only the 1st resident can advance through the main quest so good luck if your 1st resident is not as active as you. The second issue is its online mode, if you're playing with one friend is just serviceable, but if you're going to play with two or more persons (friends or internet people) you'll notice that every single time a person arrives or leaves your island, every player that is in the island have to watch an unskippable (quite long) cutscene, not only that, for some unthinkable reason, you can't navigate through menus or inventory in that particular moment, otherwise, the cutscene will be delayed. this is a serious problem particularly if you're planning to play this with several friends or if you're into the stalk market, prepare to loose 15-20 min per arrival.My third issue is more a quality of life issue, you see, Animal Crossing have ever being a game about of time, you have to wait a lot in order to have the best of it, but, at this point, selling, buying and navigating through menus is quite a burden, not only that, there are too many nitpicks to list in here, but, certainly it seems more like the game is keeping you away from having fun, is not like there aren't a lot of things to do, so it feels more like cheap padding than anything.The last issue and the one that I hate the most and it seems that no one is talking about, is its free updates, when the first official trailer launched with its terraforming promises, it also mentioned something that bothered me a lot, the fact its main events will arrive as free updates as if they need to be charged or something, in past entries these seasonal events wherein the main game, so it feels way too worrisome that now they're extra, if this game was a MMO or online specific, I wouldn't mind but, it's more like I paid full price for a game that is not finished, so if you're like me and want to play this game in some years, good luck finding those free updates.If you took your time to read this whole thing, I appreciate it a lot, even if you agree or not, I like this game a lot and have played 100 hours to this point but, is important to address its issues.… Expand	2020-04-18

From the perspective of someone who's played every game in the series since the DS, I can also vouch for this one is easily the best.Aside from some minor inconveniences and one really major inconvenience I'll get to in a minute, this game's new ideas shine. There's a lot of quality-of-life changes, but in typical Animal Crossing fashion, it's still kinda bad. For example, you don't have to worry about waiting for furniture to show up in the store because you can craft them as many times as you want whenever you want, so long as you have the materials to do so. But you can't craft the same thing in bulk, so if you have 19 manilla clams, you're gonna have to wait through 19 animations and select the options 19 times. It's not a huge deal, but it's a bummer. It's still not easy to time-travel, which I understand makes me automatically the worst person on Earth and the bane of some Tumblr users' existence, but it really should be made much easier to allow people to play the game the way they want to play it. Especially since the solution to not being able to sell things after the stores close is... not good. It's bad. It sucks. You just have to wait until the shop opens to get 80% of the bells you would've made if you'd just waited until the morning to hand it to the shop owners directly, so it completely misses the point. But again, it's really not that big a deal.That stuff holds it back from a perfect 10 out of 10, but the good absolutely outweighs the bad here.

Now my wife purchased the game and created it without knowing this, a couple of weeks into it, my son has joined the adventure only to find out he cannot make most decisions and is limited by how far my wife has progressed. I started playing to see what it was all about and indeed, it's a utterly terrible decision made by Nintendo to require you to buy 1. another switch console and 2. another ACNH copy and 3. not allow you in any way to keep your save game online and 4. not allow you to transfer the part that you've progressed to another Switch console with another game copy netting €260! So the game doesn't deserve anything more than a 0. Nintendo should feel the pain and fix this. For any other game I know it's super easy to do all those things on the same console and heck, even the free-to-play Fortnite gives me the possibility to switch between Xbox and Switch freely, the same goes with my son and we don't even need the Online membership to play online. Yet here we are with ACNH and I wouldn't be bother with the €35 additional yearly membership for a family subscription, if it would allow the full experience and not limit you to the progress of the first player, which becomes frustrating extremely quickly. And not just that, you know what the only option is for the 2nd/3rd/4th player when (in this example my wife) the first player stops liking ACNH and therefore stops playing? You might've guessed it... start completely over with a completely blank island altogether, there is no way to transfer the ownership or keep your own progress in any way. I'll keep repeating this, but this is a terrible decision by Nintendo and basically one that says: we only cater to those willing to shell out huge amounts of money on a duplicate console and a duplicate copy of the game.

Want to join an island with a bunch of friends and hold an event? Well, welcome to about 10 minutes of loading screens because every person who comes in NEEDS to essentially reset the island and have a giant loading screen.It isn't just when it comes to playing online, it is just about every aspect from finding certain characters and needing to prompt dialogue with them 5x to get to the right spot (let's pretend that programmers can't make dialogue a continuous thing lol) or trying to fish and the fish moving a little bit out of your way and having to cast the line with little to no aim. You constantly miss shovel spots, hit spots, balloons, and so many things because the way the game is designed is just... very incredibly poor.The developers basically see traditional gaming and try to piss on it, which is fine and dandy, but what's left is a technically bad game with overly tedious moments that take control of the game 95% of the play. It seems like Nintendo hired 3rd year programming students who have some help from veterans on how to get stuff done, but overall you can tell the programmers in this game are just daft and at the end of their wits, which is why it also doesn't shock me that it is one island per Switch, it's literally them being incapable of programming that logic into the game.… Expand	2020-04-19

Pay upEven the things you do daily consist on a exchange of currency, if you want to relocate a tree, you have to consume fruit to be able to relocate it, your tools break so you have to constantly get materials to craft them again.And every time you move 1 ramp, one bridge or one building it takes 1 whole real life day, yeah, it won’t be finished until 5 am the next day, 1 ramp/bridge per day, if you want to destroy and build another bridge (you can’t relocate them, you have to pay again) you have to wait til the day after tomorrow! On the positive side the game looks gorgeous, there is an IMMENSE amount of items, furniture, clothing, wallpapers, floors etc The art of the game is impecable.But the problem is that this is a game of collecting items and decorating, it may not be for everyone, there’s not much to do story-wise after you finish paying the 5 rooms you can expand on your home and achieve a 3 rating star on your island , so you are left with decorating and collecting items, and that’s it, a beautiful shell of a game with no much gameplay but shake trees and mine ores.Also, you can’t build more than 8 ramps in your island, you can’t build ramps next to another, you can’t build a ramp that leads straight to your museum because they are made of 2 blocks and the museum is 5 blocks wide, the lack of symmetry on some parts makes me irrationally mad. The cherry on top is that you can only have 1 island per switch, the dialog is very unintuitive and the online functionality is ok but a pain if you have more than 2-3 visitors with unnecessary repetitive loading animations.… Expand	2020-04-19

This whole game is like outfitting an empty museum which will never be visited by many interested visitors. That's about it, that is the extent of interaction this game provides - for the multiplayer part see almost every other review. The only feature that made me play this game 5 minutes a day for several days is the skinner box, i.e. the variable rewards, i.e. the chance that maybe a rare piece of furniture appears in one of the balloons/lootboxes or in one of the ingame stores.

I read it had been review bombed on here so bought it anyway despite all the bad reviews, after owning for a week I can actually believe there would be that many negative reviews it is really disappointing. Me and my daughter hammered Stardew valley for hours/days on end she has been so excited for this to replace it. The gfx are better and as a single player game she says its ok, but the multi player game they really dropped the ball so you can only have one island per console. At first I didn't think this was too much an issue we could both play on that island although I would have liked to have a separate island under my user account I can progress and send my character to hers it's not possible. One progressing player PER CONSOLE. Basically if you are the person playing with the island owner everything you do is pointless, items you pick up go straight in the island recycle bin. So you can switch leader but this is just covering up the fact this is equally pointless as what's the point nothing you do matters you may be able to access your nook phone as leader but then the other person's stuff just goes straight in the recycle bin instead. It's sad as my daughter is 8 she loves us playing games together she wants me to play this but it's just mind numbingly boring for the second player. The second player can pick items up they go straight in the town recycling bin so unless you want to run all way back there the leader may as well pick everything up as you are never more than a few steps away from each other as you as sharing the same screen, I basically spent hours just following her around like a dog on a lead, and every time I pick my damn bone up it vanishes into the village bin and only my owner can pick it out, following her doing absolutely nothing you can't even explore as you get teleported right next to them when you reach the edge of the screen. I can tell she's disappointed when I say you just play on your own but Jesus there is only so many hours you can spend pointlessly walking around after someone with no purpose what so ever and if you do get involved and pick some items up you have to walk all way back the town centre to pick them up and even then only the leader can access them so I pick them up we walk all way to town Square then she picks them out she even said I may as well pick them up in first place because then we don't have to run back and forth. I think to call this a multiplayer game at all is a disgrace. I'm not a review bomber just a very disappointed dad. We bought it for multiplay and we are playing Stardew valley again a week later that cost us £10 years ago. I tried to keep the review serious but multiplayer is a joke so we had 5min fun her making me out silly outfits on, apart from that I honestly have had more fun playing with the old paperclip Microsoft office assistant. Everything switch seems to be a cash cow theese days, Nintendo asking £59 for mario kart 8 deluxe still which is just a rehash of mario kart 8 that came out 7 or so years ago on their last gen console and super Mario Bros u Deluxe, some crook in Nintendo saying yes let's take our old game bang deluxe on the end and re release it still for top money on the new console. I will not be buying another Nintendo game system. It's only getting 2 stars as a single player game it's alright but only one player can play single player unless you buy another switch and another game as all the other user accounts have to use the same island only the island owner can progress on. Just glad my other child is 2 and doesn't understand as I would be livid at the thought of having to buy another switch and game so he could play single player as well what a damn disgrace  I am utterly disgusted with this money grabbing joke of a game. Bottom line want a fun game to play with your kids get Stardew valley or Minecraft might be old but just as good and the price is spot on value for what you get. This game replaces nothing, better yet get a Windows 95 pc and have a conversation with the office assistant. PATHETIC... PATHETIC!!!!… Expand	2020-04-20

You aren't pressed for time and can do what you want. I spent my first two weeks catching a wide variety of creatures to fill the museum, creating my own house and trying to make money.However, I then spent the next two weeks doing the exact same thing.You need allot of money to progress in this game, so you're going to have to go catch creatures and craft items to sell. Once you upgrade your house you are then presented with another option to upgrade (progress in the game, essentially) so you'll have to go catch creatures and craft items to sell so you can get another upgrade and do the same thing again and again.This isn't just limited to the main game either, filling out the museum requires you to spend hours catching fish and bugs over and over and finding fossils (you have high chances to keep getting creatures and fossils you've found before).The character dialogue? repeating. You start to notice the same dialogue being used over and over after about a week or so of playing, and while that may be fine normally this is a game that's supposed to be some sort of long term investment and is praised for its supposed 'small details' and charm, which I found ran out after the first week as the game kept trying to repeat the same tricks over and over to try and impress and engage me. This game is essentially a one trick pony, after the initial 'wow' there's not much left to be impressed by.Its fun at first but everything about this game screams repetition, its more like a chore than a fun game.I can't really recommend this game, its not the worst game I've ever played, but its just dreadfully boring.… Expand	2020-04-20

What I do have a problem with is the game itself, it's way too grindy and doesn't offer me a 'relaxing' experience like others claim. I find myself actually getting stressed more because I can't find the materials I need to proceed, for example, 30 iron nuggets to build the shop. There are 3 stones on my island and not 1 gave me an iron nugget, meaning I have to constantly spend Nook Miles to go to other islands so I can get them, it took me multiple days just to complete that task due to bad RNG. And don't get me started on the 3 plot stuff...6 items per plot, and some of the materials needed for said items I cannot get on my island at all, which means MORE grinding for Nook Miles to travel to other islands for them to potentially not even have the materials I need. I just want to be able to have villagers on my island without having to constantly grind.I'll give it to Nintendo that the animal residents are adorable. It's why I was dragged to the game in the first place, which looking back was a huge mistake. With all the content it has, I can see why it's being sold for £50, but the gameplay itself doesn't make up for it.

And to my disappointment, it was such a chore that it became boring after two weeks of playing.Some of the aspects that killed the game for me:1. Grind. I initially expected the game to be kind of similar to Stardew Valley. There, you were always rewarded for everything: catching new species, donating items to the museum, talking and giving gifts to the villagers (aka getting cutscenes and gifts).What is the situation like in ACNH? Want to travel to mystery islands (actually a one very cool feature), want some cool hairstyles? You gotta get nook miles. And in order to get them, you’re given the most enjoyable tasks ever imaginable: chop 10 trees, catch 10 bugs, sell 20 weed. It was getting so tedious I wanted to CRY. People actually spend 60$ on this and enjoy it??Museum is actually really beautiful on the inside, I did not expect it at first. But the sensation wears off real quick, because essentially it’s all this game is about - looks. Nothing rewarding in terms of gameplay.2. Villagers. Again, can be pretty, but they all have the same cookie cutter cutter cute and lovely personality. Maybe it’s me who’s got so unlucky, i don’t know. But you can develop even characters like this, but all I got is some copy paste bs monologue about how that one likes to sleep and eat, and that other one likes to lift weights. Amazing.3. The time you have to spend to do such routine like buying or selling. Like honestly, do I REALLY need  to stop to read greetings every time I walk into the shop, followed by ANOTHER line when I try to talk to them?? To then watch how my character hands them the goods, and they talk pointlessly??Optimize the menus for god’s sake and stop making everything so slow. You can make immersive game without trying to artificially drag out things like selling, buying and crafting, especially when you’re doing it so frequently...4. It was actually partially my fault for not reading about the game enough, but real time synchronization is stupid. You want to build a home, a bridge, or literally anything? Wait for one day. Want to see new clothes? Wait one day. Want to have fun right now? Unlucky for you, wait one day.I could get behind this idea if it wouldn’t have hindered me from doing what I want when I want. Why can’t I move quickly with the game if I want to? Why is this game forcing one play style on everyone?I know you can time travel, which I usually do, even though it kinda feels like cheating. And you know why? Because if you do that, it’s extremely apparent that the game relies on that real time gimmick to be interesting. It severely lacks any real content.I believe you will enjoy the ACNH if you like customizing stuff, because it’s one thing the game is objectively good at.All in all,  I really, REALLY tried to like this game. But you can only catch bugs for so long.… Expand	2020-04-21
7	OwenlyTheBest	Love the game but it can't be understated how ludicrous the one island per switch limitation is. My rating is unfair on the game but Nintendo's being unfair on us, forcing us to buy another £300 system for a limitation that simply doesn't have to be there. Imagine they only had one save for each system for the likes of Mario Odyssey and Breath of the Wild!	2020-04-21

It does lack stuff to do at about two weeks in, after a certain event, that somewhat signifies the end of the tutorial if you could really call it that. But after that you'll soon learn that in Animal Crossing, there is always something to do! The Nook Miles are a great addition, giving you something to do even when you are done with your daily chores, which only consist of the usual Animal Crossing activities such as fishing and catching bugs, doing favors etc. It should also be noted that the game improves upon New Leaf in a variety of ways. For instance the sound design is spectacular! One of the best sounding games on the Switch system, if not the best overall. There are some things however that are cause for controversy, such as the local multiplayer issue, in which the leader is pretty much the only one who gets to do anything, while any one else can collect materials, they go to the recycling bin in the resident services tent/building, which is fine till you realize that anyone can access that, and take the other players stuff, and to top it off the second player can't take it till either they are the leader, or they boot up the game by themselves. Another setback is the exclusion of cloud saves/backups. While Nintendo has stated that there will be a way to get your island back in the case of console loss or theft, it has not to my knowledge been implemented yet. So basically  for now say your console got stolen, you would lose all of your progress, and as someone who has accidentally lost their save game, it is not a great time building back up what you lost. So, in conclusion the game is sub-par... just kidding this is the best selling Animal Crossing for a reason, if you have the means to purchase this game DO, you will not regret it, just keep in mind some of the disappointing aspects of the game, and try to keep your console itself safe! I know that times are rough right now, so I just wanted to say to any one who actually reads this, if you can't afford the game do NOT go out of your way to buy it, save your money for food and other living costs! Stay safe, and have fun!… Expand	2020-04-22

And building your museum collection up with insects and fish is nicely done and good to see your efforts displayed. The fossils part is done well and actually displays them in a chronological and evolutional order which is fun to discover and I’m sure kids will love it.    However this lasts about a week and then after that it starts to wear a bit thin.I have no problem with the real time aspect of the game per-say (I also dolt mind the accelerated clock in Stardew Vally both have their merits) however I do feel like it was done to extend the life of the game. And the repetitive nature of the game does become a bit boring you will find yourself just doing the same menial tasks over and over for little or no reward. At times it does feel like a mobile game you have paid £50 for to play on a £300 console. Also it’s 2020 Nintendo why is it not a fully 3D game? Not being able to rotate the camera 360 degrees? I mean come on.Not being able to craft more than 1 thing at a time is also annoying I have 8 clams and I want to make 8 fish bait, I can’t just select make 8 and it does it, no you have to go through the same process and animation 8 times! The islands you visit via nook miles will soon become repetitive as seems to be limited to about 10(?) different layouts I have visited the same island 3 times in 2 days. 6000 miles well spent.The dialog with your island buddies soon becomes irritating as they just repeat the same lines over and over and don’t really offer anything. Multiplayer is a mess why can’t I open my gate and my friends just pop over? No I have to sit through the same loading screen and animation for every person that visits and same when they leave plus when they are arrive there is nothing to do? No mini games or anything to do together which is a shame. I have also knocked a point off for the 1 island per console stroke that Nintendo have pulled just to try and sell more units - luckily me and my wife are happy to share a character so in our house it’s not an issue but I can see how it could cause problems. The tools breaking without any warning is also frustrating! Why no status bar? We had this in Minecraft a game that was made in what 2007? And gold tools shouldn’t break! I’ve worked hard for them and the they just break? It should be a reward for all your hard work. I don’t want to seem like I’m just moaning about the game as I have had fun playing it and i think of your prepared to look past the annoyances there is a good game in there! And it’s a break from the normal FPS/Action/FIFA style games. I just wish a bit more thought was put into the UI and Quality Of Life of the player. I also have a sneaking suspicion that Micro Transactions are on the way as it’s a game primed for it but I hope I’m wrong!Would have got a 7/10 from me if it wasn’t for the 1 island per switch idea.

However, the game itself really could have used more time in the oven. While I don't share an island with anyone on my Switch, I still see that it's a major problem with co-op and I will acknowledge that Nintendo did consumers dirty with that move. One of the game's main draws, the DIY crafting system, takes up a lot of the game and unfortunately to its detriment. New Horizons has undoubtedly the slowest start out of every game in the series, even slower than New Leaf. The DIY system not helping at all, considering all of the materials one must gather and furniture they must build just to get the first few neighbors to move in, not to mention that said materials aren't kept in their own separate inventory. Same with tools, and as a result, inventory space gets eaten up surprisingly quick, even with the upgrade. Speaking of tools, they are handled in the worst way possible. Any tool can now break after enough use, now while that doesn't sound like anything new, there's actually no indication of when they will break. Unlike Breath of the Wild, there's no notice of any kind when they will break, so it can easily happen out of nowhere, forcing you to have to run back to a DIY bench and craft a new one after getting the necessary materials for it. Even the golden tools are breakable, which as a series staple of being some of the best tools to use in the games, devalues them by a lot. Even the Golden Axe breaks, which has always been known to be indestructible, which gave players a huge incentive to get it, but in New Horizons, it's just only a grade above a regular axe; as Silver tools are nowhere to be seen either. Also, who at Nintendo was in charge of the fish spawn rates? Black Bass and Sea Bass have always been known to be annoyingly common as some kind of running joke in the series, however said joke has run its course to the ground real hard in this installment. They tend to spawn way more often than in any other game in the series, making some fish an absolute chore to try and get, and it can turn what was supposed to be a relaxing experience into complete and utter frustration. Also, certain upgrades and buildings take way too long to complete, the museum probably being the most notorious as of writing this, as Blathers took forever to open up thus making players have to hoard their catches for days until he finally opened up the building. Not to mention that some characters have been found in the game's code, yet aren't in the game and are clearly meant for post-launch updates, yet New Leaf already had these from the start. Speaking of post-launch updates, this game needs them as soon as possible, there are some heavy Quality of Life changes that New Horizons can use and for the better. As it stands as of writing this, New Leaf is still easily the better game. At least when you had the campsite in that game, you didn't have to invite them via amiibo THREE SEPARATE TIMES to get them to move in, and you didn't have to craft something for them each time. Especially any DIY recipes involving shells, those being some of the worst because of the bad spawn RNG. Hopefully, Nintendo responds in kind and gives the game the treatment that it deserves as an entry in this beloved franchise.… Expand	2020-04-22

It’s everything Animal Crossing wasTo start, this game is incredibly fun at its base. But there are some truly asinine decisions made by Nintendo here that simply should not be accepted in a modern game. They don’t deserve to be praised like they are being for hurting customers with bad and artificial restrictions. The good: this game is, as far as straight gameplay goes, truly wonderful. It’s everything Animal Crossing was meant to be and it retains the heart of the series. While it’s missing quite a few of the features previous games had, updates look to be coming regularly to bring it up to par (looking at you Redd and Lief from the recent update). It’s charming, has lasting appeal, and has enough to do that even past the first few weeks you’ll want to pick it up every day. The eh: people with odd hours may want to set their time zone to a more traditional time before playing. I tend to be up at odd hours due to my job and on a lot of days that means I’m not allowed to sell items at full price, sell turnips, buy clothes, talk to most of my neighbors, or catch certain fish/bugs. Time travel still works in this game but turnips will spoil if you do. The nature of the game dictates that you have things tied to time but give nighttime players more to do! If I happen to be only able to play at 1 am one night I should be relegated to only resident services and the museum, with the occasional visit from Whisp.The bad: if you want to play this game with anybody other than yourself, you’re looking at the most tedious and unnecessary multiplayer system known to man. A long animation is required for each player visiting your item. It requires you to exit all menus and failure to do so means the visitor can’t come. If more than one person try to visit at the same time, at least one will get an error and have to keep trying. It makes visiting with friends incredibly difficult. If you want to have anybody else in your household play the game look forward to buying more Switches because the only option is to share your island. That doesn’t sound so bad EXCEPT only one person gets the full experience. My mom wanted to play so she got her own tent on my island. Since I’ve been playing for weeks though, she gets zero build up, far fewer nook miles, ZERO instruction past a handful of things, and she needs me for a lot of major island additions like houses. Why can’t it be an option to create a separate save file for each person? I’m guessing that good old fashioned Nintendo greed has to do with it. It’s not enough to pay up to $300 for a console and another $60 for a game I’d bet will never see a sale, if you want to have the full experience for everybody in your house on a so called family console, you’ll need to shell out at minimum $260 for a switch lite and another copy of AC to give just one more person. Also, speaking of my mother, I went to visit her for a week and went to change my time zone to hers so we could get the standard experience. That means that all 800,000 bells worth of turnips that I had spoiled. I live in Eastern time and she lives in Central. ANY time travel backward means your turnips spoil. Look I get it, time travelers don’t get to game the turnip market. But I’m not manually setting my time here, just updating a time zone to reflect where I’m at physically. But that makes me a dirty cheater apparently and I’m being punished as such. What else could possibly be wrong here you ask? How about zero cloud save support despite the promise it’d be added ‘shortly’ after launch. How about no bulk crafting for items you’ll definitely need in bulk. How about the first major event completely ruining some of the best part of the game by turning everything into eggs? This game could’ve been perfect. And I know some of those gripes may not mean much to some, but it’s a serious disappointment to me coming back to the series for the first time in a long time to see it turned into a frustrating version of perfection.  I have zero hope nintendo will do the right thing and fix most of these issues. This is why I tend to stay away from Nintendo. Every time I give them another shot they take my money and give me half a product. Shame on them, but shame on me too for trusting them. And for playing this game still. Despite everything it’s still too fun to put down, even if I am incredibly frustrated. That’s why it gets a 4 and not a 0, but there should be a warning on every box about all the ways Nintendo will force you to have fun on their terms and not your own.… Expand	2020-04-23

I'm not even given the (bad) option of buying a second copy of the game to open up the option for a 2nd island.  This is an awful, awful design decision.  If the motivation is to stop cheating, first of all, why would the devs care if somebody is cheating at a single player life simulator?  Ruining the experience for multiple players within the household only creates a bigger problem.  Until this game is patched with a reasonable option for individual players on the same console to have their own individual experiences, this game is worthless to me and many others.

I played the game the day it released and it’s become part of my daily schedule ever since then. The game offers a peaceful getaway from the stress of the real world and allows you to turn a deserted island into your own personal paradise. Like Minecraft once said “the only limit is your creativity” and that fits perfectly for this game. Almost unlimited design options from planting flowers to terraforming mountains and waterfalls allows players to practically play god and do whatever their heart desires. The start of the game is a bit slow and tedious as players try to get all the buildings and upgrades so you can do as you will. The core part of the game is building a community with these adorable animals that will populate your town that have their own personalities and preferences. Featuring many popular returning faces including Tom nook, Timmy and Tommy, Isabelle, able sisters, Leif and many more you are bound to reunite with your childhood favorites. Collecting different rare fish, bugs, and fossils is a main component of the game and can be, annoying, at times but makes you feel accomplished apon collection. Multiplayer is something I use frequently in the game and I’ve discovered it to be, boring. No mini games, annoying communication, and limited interaction forces players to come up with their own things to do (or just awkwardly stand next to each other and doing emotes). Multiplayer is good for trading but that’s honestly about it from what I’ve personally experienced. In a game where you can do almost anything there is something for everyone here and can bring some peace to even the rowdiest of souls. With no violence, swears, drugs, or sexual references this is almost a “shell shock” being seen as one of the best selling games of the year so far. This game allows me to stress out about where to put my flowers instead of stressing out about deadlines and drama and is a nice feeling that only this game can deliver.

How? Let me braked down why this game failed so many people:1. Shared Console, Shared IslandNow I personally don't mind sharing my Animal Crossing world with my brother. Creating an aesthetic together and foraging really harks back to our childhood. The option to play simultaneously on the one screen is also a great, much needed addition to the series, but why isn't it optional??Nintendo decided that each Switch console will be limited to ONE ISLAND per system. That means if you and whoever you may share your console with want to play this game, you will be forced to live together on the island indefinitely. All island data is stored locally on the console, so no amount of $$$ spent on separate game cartridges will ever solve this, so if you want a different island, you'll need another console AND another copy of the game.The Switch is the most powerful and innovative Nintendo system to date, with a default storage of 32GB. Animal Crossing New Horizons is 6.4GB before any save data is stored, and after a combined playtime of 60hrs between myself and my brother, the game now takes up 6.5GB of our total storage! An additional 100MB for two accounts and a whole island?! That's it?! Surely each account could have the option to share an island or have one to themselves?! This is so disheartening as this is such a primitive move by Nintendo... but it's not even the worst.First in, First ServedNow the whole appeal of this new game was the fact that you were no longer limited to only decorating the interior of your home. Placing buildings wherever you want, inviting residents to your town, starting construction on bridges and ramps, the ability to carve rivers into the landscape ... if you were the first user to play the game on your shared console.Any person who decides to join your island after you will be almost indefinitely restricted to shaking trees, fishing, and popping balloons. Yes of course there are a few more features to play with and enjoy, but how long will these last before they become tedious for player 2?Unfortunately i was the second user to join a New Horizons island and as I approach my 50th hour of gameplay, I'm beginning to feel ripped off. For any progression to happen to our island requires my brother (player 1) to play the game as much as i do so that he gets the prompt to upgrade the shop, or place a new building, or build a new bridge. And what happens when my bother loses interest in the game? Will I have to consistently log him in and out to progress? Will I have to restart our island? There is a sense of pride and individuality that you hold for your unique villager. Swapping to my brother's villager to receive building privileges would allow me to build the things i want, but deep down I feel I'm being stripped of achievement and that my villager is basically useless.With these setbacks I believe the game only deserves a 2/10, but I'm holding onto a hope that in a future update Nintendo will fix these issues for their otherwise perfect game.… Expand	2020-04-25

I wish I had known this limitation on launch day, but we stayed away from too much info so we didn't spoil the initial fun and no one wants to reset your stuff after a few days of work already got put in.The community of designers is pretty awesome and both my wife and daughter love customizing their homes with the shared designs.… Expand	2020-04-27
10	Gravityhappened	The game is by far the best animal crossing. It takes every animal crossing game & expands upon it. Which is everything we ask for in sequels. HOWEVER my only complaint is it’s not innovative for this day & age. The first animal crossing will always be timeless because of what it was for it’s time. Still, new horizons does not disappoint.	2020-04-27

But when New horizons released she was eager to let me jump in. I have never played animal crossing, but this was outstandingly a great experience, I fell in love. But I struggled to help her build homes, and wasn't treated the same, nor did I interact with importance with Tom, I felt discriminated against. I soon learned why, with the one island per console, and the founder having all the decision making, really, really, really sucked. I would have loved to then start my own island, or co-run the one we were in. I couldn't choose where buildings went, I couldn't progress, and I couldn't even invite villagers, one of the most important and enjoyable aspects of the entire game! I was stuck, and worst of all... This literally damaged my relationship with my sister. I'm twice her age and I felt we finally found a way to bond, but no, Nintendo turned from a family connecting idea, to a family tearing nightmare. I absolutely hate it, and I can't play it anymore, and that has led my sister to stop, and now I feel guilty, and everything is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. How could a overly family friendly game turn into a despair-enducing experience. However, it's still a 4 because if you were solo this game is absolutely perfect, but this game is built around socializing and family, and it decided it wanted to ruin both.

The same-switch co-op is cool and a nice addition, but Isn't something you'll use much outside of the first few days.

As I said before I like the idea of sharing an island, just not the fact that as I'm the second user on the console to play the game all I get to do are the side tasks and just collect fauna and customise a house. If there was no way around having more than one player doing the main game tasks like choosing where to set up tents and then other things I wont mention for spoilers sake, then they shouldn't of had the one island concept. It's just disappointing and frustrating how I cant even take part in advancing the island as a whole.Co-op is also pointless, you get to pick up items and shake trees, that's it. Another game first for me where the second player does absolutely nothing. My only hope is that they'll bring out an update that gives every player their own island so they get to experience the WHOLE game. But this is highly doubtful. :(… Expand	2020-04-28

They are patching the game to make you play the way THEY want you to play. But, in turn, the game is less fun in my opinion.

As of right now there are only 2 shops and all other NPC's only visit once in awhile on unpredictable schedules.-What is the point of Isabelle announcements at the start of each day if she's not going to tell me when I have visitors like Sahara or Celeste just to name a few. I have defintely missed days with them on my island simply because I did not know they were here.-Rugs sold from Sahara cannot be placed outdoors, why bother buying these if they can only be placed in my house when they would go PERFECTLY with the furniture I set up outside? Big opportunity missed there...-Buying clothing from the Able Sisters shop is so time consuming, especially if I'm visiting someone else's island in the sense that I can only purchase one type of clothing at a time (ex buying the same shirt in multiple colors, I have to enter and exit the changing room several times). If there are other people waiting to use the single changing room available, it really slows everyone down.-The crafting / DIY setup is really great, but I'd like to be able to craft multiple items at a time and have my in home work bench connect to what's in storage in home.

This has always been how Animal Crossing games work where multiple users share a town. It allows you to talk to the same NPCs, contribute collectively to the museum, etc. so that you share the experience with your household, rather than having disparate experiences on different saves. It's how the game is supposed to be played, and I dare say it is better for it. My siblings and I shared a town in the original AC as a kid and one of the best parts was hiding items for others to find, talking about the villagers, and visiting each others' houses. None of this would be possible if each player had their own island on a single system.It's also true that there are some things which only the first player can do... This feels arbitrary and actually is a bit of a bummer. I assume Nintendo did this for narrative reasons, and so that adults playing with their kids wouldn't have to live with their child's poor decisions or something like that... But as I said, it does feel a bit unnecessary and evokes more negative emotions than positive ones, so I don't think this was a very smart design decision. Still, the impact of these is actually pretty minimal in the grand scheme of the game, as becomes more apparent the longer you play. Some people evidently did not play long enough and just posted their immediate gut reaction.The slow pace of the game is not for everyone, but oddly most of the reviews here don't even touch on that. You should approach Animal Crossing a bit more like the Sims than your typical game; that is, the goals are mainly to do basic life tasks, decorate, and talk to people. It's much more driven by self-narrative, and your ability to enjoy it is going to depend on your own imagination and willingness to buy into the game world.Once you get past the initial cluelessness of wondering what you're supposed to be doing, you realize there is a lot to do and the answer is whatever you feel like. Fishing, catching bugs, collecting furniture, coordinating outfits, arranging trees... It's all part of the experience, but the game does not force you to do one particular thing. New Horizons specifically adds some nice touches with the ability to place furniture outside, storage inside your house, etc. which are a sweet improvement over previous installments, and in a lot of ways make this the best Animal Crossing yet.There are minor things I wish they did differently. For instance, I would like to mail things to friends before I visit their island, but I understand why that isn't an option. (Traditionally in AC games, you can only send letters to villagers after you have spoken with them directly. So they applied the same logic to real players.) It would be nice if the shared-screen co-op allowed you to do things like travel together or open both players' inventories. (The system in place has a leader and a follower, where the follower is restricted in what they can do... But you can switch who the leader is very quickly if need be.) All of these things are rather petty in the grand scheme of things, though.The game is fantastic and has a wide array of content, with evidence of much more on its way. We have already gotten a pretty beefy patch and a few events, so it seems like Nintendo is committed to regular updates at least for another year+, given its popularity. You could see some of the complaints become irrelevant due to future updates, or they may just pack in a bunch more content. Either way, the updates are really the cherry on top of a game that is easily one of the best of the year. Don't listen to the complainers.By the way, it's perfectly fine to play this game solo, too. ;) Reviews shouldn't be so heavily weighted on the multiplayer experience only.… Expand	2020-04-29

Little by little you improve your island and your house and soon garner villagers to populate your village. You can pull weeds, catch bugs, fish, dig for fossils, design clothes, flags and a great many other things. It does get a bit repetitive, but is fun for me nonetheless.

There is no doubt in my mind. The creativity and attention to detail that was put in by the developers is nothing short than inspiring. There is a part of me that is genuinely concerned for the future of the series, not for anything bad for the game, but for how much it has to offer. Where else can they go? The next installment is going to be something I'm afraid of. They might not even come out with one and just update this gem of creativity. I'm afraid I'm not explaining enough, but what I mean is that from each iteration we gain a new customizable feature. From being from a standard town, then to a bigger place with friends being able to visit, then to an even bigger place that has a city element, to being a mayor able to change layouts and buildings and now to a god as the community jokes about being able to shift the land itself. Hopefully, that explains my concern about the future of this game, where next? This definitely is, in my eyes, the ultimate animal crossing game and has provided millions of people including myself, hours upon hours of relaxing release. As I cross the 350-hour mark, I think its time for me to explain how I felt about the game. As the beginning is slow and may take a lot of time to start feeling like the traditional animal crossing everyone knows, you start understanding how the game is trying to teach you the fundamentals of the new mechanics introduced. It can be frustrating at first if you're the impatient type, but it is well understood the more you play. That's what makes all these negative comments so surprising to read for me. I never have written a review to anything other than amazon products and maybe a youtube comment if you consider that a review of some sorts. I even made an account to just write about this topic. Yes, the game is limited to one island per person. Do not go into this game expecting to have the experience of a maximum of 8 islands on your system. This is apparently is a reason for people to be giving the game a 0 on this site and others as well. Not about the gameplay, or what a good/bad game it is, or even how slow it takes to start as I thought the negative reviews would be about. No, it's about how f you have more than one account on your switch, the others won't be allowed to terraform the island. I cannot think of anyone who would od this other than children or people who are playing Animal crossing for the first time. I don't mean any of those remarks as insults, and I will explain. New leaf, the last game in the series before New Horizons. One player was the mayor, and that's it. Anyone else playing on your 3DS won't have access to those features. If the reasons for that aren't apparent to you, then you don't understand how basic computing and video games work and that's okay. It's okay to not understand something, that's why you should seek the information that you don't understand. Just think about how much memory it would take for the switch to have a maximum of 8 islands with all unique layouts, villagers, and all the other features that make this game the masterpiece that it is. That's not possible to fit on the system itself, therefore it's not a reality. It wasn't for the 3DS, so why is it a problem all a sudden? That's when kids come into the picture. Parents will usually buy one system for the house and each kid wants to have their own island which I completely understand as I would as well as a child. However, does that inherently make it a bad game? Of course not. I have another family member on my island who doesn't have terraforming access as they are the second player to move in. When they want to change something about the island they do one of the possible two things. They either ask me to change it for them, or they log in as me and do it themselves. Oh yeah, did I mention the ability to switch accounts on the switch is Minimalistically seamless? It takes less than 5 seconds to change profiles and start a game. It's fine to criticize a game, but it's downright insane to mass bad review a game for system limitations when the problem has nothing to do with the gameplay its self. If I'm the wrong one for feeling this way then so be it, I'll stand alone. Is Nintendo just doing this to sell more consoles? Most definitely not, however, I don't think they are complaining that this is an issue. Then that gets into the problem of how the bad reviews may affect Nintendo, but it hurts the animal crossing franchise more. People will see the negative source for consumers and assume it's just another game that critics love and the public didn't, further greatening the divide between creators and fans. I really don't know what to say at this point other than how disappointing it is to see the gaming culture turn into this immaturity and not appreciate the art that countless artists spent years creating.… Expand	2020-04-29

The game isn't perfect, bit it isn't a 0 either.

It's a great game, and greatly outweighs the setbacks of only one island.The main people review bombing and giving this game a zero are the idiots with a goldfish attention span who speed-run / timeskip a literally casual game to try and beat it, (if you honestly thought that going in, you deserved to feel ripped off lmao), and the salty butthurt 10-IQ mouth-breathers who who bought the game without reading then wondering why there's only one switch file per system. Again, they stated COUNTLESS TIMES that this game ONLY HAS ONE SAVE FILE PER SWITCH CONSOLE. If you were stupid enough to ignore all of that and still buy the game, that's again, your fault for not having the capacity to read simple and basic disclaimers.Also, this game is getting updates as we speak, there's a good chance that such things will make it back in the game. ALSO X2, whine all you want, the game sold extremely well and Nintendo, nor true animal crossing fans like me who actually buy this game and enjoy playing it, are laughing at all the haters. Stay salty, this game killed it in sales, and it's going to continue to kill it as one of the best games of the year.Long story short, If you want to play multiple save files, or cheat your way through the game, play new leaf. Otherwise shut up, grow up, let people enjoy things, and deal with it. 10/10.… Expand	2020-04-29

You can't sell things on a friends island if you are playing too late at night. if someone tries to come to your island they will not be able to if you have a dialog box open. When a person comes everyone involved will have to wait through a lengthy loading screen. If anyone disconnects everyone's progress will be lost.

Considering there's still only 4 personalities for each gender, the only reason to ever get attached to a villager comes down to how they look, not really what they say.The reason I'm mixed on this game an' maybe the series as a whole is that I wish there were more activities to do instead of the same fishin', bug catchin', shell collectin', fossil huntin', an' flower planting. With all these decorations in the game, you'd think you could interact with more than a handful of 'em in an interesting way. To shorten my review a bit, I think Jim Sterling sums it up pretty well in his jimpression of the game.Even though I don't have anyone who I share my Switch with that also plays the game, I can understand those who wanna have their own separate island between accounts an' it must be really frustrating to deal with.I don't like local multiplayer at all but online multiplayer is generally much better. I hate havin' to use Nintendo Switch Online app since it's unnecessary to need an app for basic online stuff that Sony an' Microsoft have been doin' since they've built it into their systems. Nintendo needs to stop being complacent with their terrible track record of trashy online service.My biggest gripe with the game is there bein' no cloud save data for New Horizons, making me fear the worst the more time into it. The game's director says it's to prevent cheating...even though the game is mostly played solo. I heard Splatoon's director sayin' somethin' similar to justify Splatoon 2's problems which were also pretty stupid. Havin' no cloud saves is a massive double-edge sword in that while it would prevent cheating, you could lose ALL that hard work due to some unforeseen reason which'll make me feel like I did all that for nothin'. In other words, it devalues the time I put into everything in the game in first place which is what the developers wanna promote. I understand the sentiment, but Time Travelin' is a thing albeit on a lesser scale (which I admittedly use from time to time) an' that ain't causin' a riot or at least it shouldn't be. Is cheating really that big of a problem in a game where you create your own experience? Are you serious? It'd be one thing if somethin' like this was runnin' rampant online in other games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, but come on. If people rather stick to the legit way of playin', that's their decision. If people rather put their time into moddin' the game to speed up the progress, that's their decision. Simple. Whether they regret it in the long run is on them.I like this franchise, but there's a lot of room for improvement. Hopefully, some of the game's issues are patched.… Expand	2020-04-30

I personally don't have a problem with the one island per console as I'm the sole user.Pros:It's quirky and cute and engaging and there are so many things to make.The time of year events are a nice touch, but could be more interestingCons:Most DIY items, shopping items etc are the equivalent of the amazon deals page; a few nice items but 95% plastic tat. I understand the aim of the game is to fill your island with consumer goods to raise it's 'rating' but it really just feels like someone raided the unity asset store for free models; very few things are aesthetically pleasing.Interactions, menus, inventory etc feel unintuitive (to me);i) 'drop' should not be the top item on the inventory menu.ii) I want to be able to shake a tree for fruit even if I'm holding a spade without it trying to (ineffectively) dig up the tree.iii) Many sub menu interactions kick you out of the whole menu/inventory after doing one thing, e.g. unequip a hat, and if you want to do anything else (unequip more etc) back into the inventory you go.Dialogs/Messageboxes are WAY too verbose and always on; most games with chat dialog may have a verbose version the first time, and then a terse version from then on, not AC. Every time you talk to a shop keeper you get the whole 4 or 5 dialog box spiel you have to click through (even pressing b to speed things up it's still a chore), want to post a few presents to friends? *Every* one requires you to read 'hmmm, it looks like they have a postcard rack, maybe I could...' - 'who do you want to send it to?' - 'connecting to the internet' -etc, and when you're done, do you go back to the previous menu for more? No, you're kicked out to start again... 'hmmm, it looks like...'This coupled with the above items means for example it takes *minutes* to buy one of each of the few flowers on sale from the flower merchant; click through spiel, choose item, buy, watch unnecessary animation of bells being handed over and flower being handed back, click another message, repeat. We need multi-select to buy (like fossil assessment), we need shopkeepers to have a 'I've heard this message 300 times, please just say hello and go straight to the wares' mode.Some shops even force you to click out of a dialog just to exit the shop!The island-visitor restrictions are odd, and strikes me (as a software developer for over 20 years) as a quick workaround rather than solve an underlying issue:Why do we need to close dialogs when someone is visiting?Why do we need to watch a (needlessly long, honestly, what other games take so long for people to join?) progress animation as they 'fly in'Why can I not place items when someone is there?Why can I not talk to a shopkeeper when a visitor is in the changing room.All these things make the friends/visitor mechanism stilted, janky and, like everything else, a choreEvery time you catch or make something you have to watch a little 'look what I caught/made' animation, with a terrible pun, of which there is only one per item: 'I caught a sea bass, oh no it's at least a C plus' (I have stopped fishing simply because of these, and of course, you have to click again, to dismiss it.With crafting, each item (and YOU CAN ONLY MAKE ONE AT A TIME) has an animation too (while you can speed up the crafting time, basically, you have to sit there mashing a button to make a number of the same itemsAll of which could be avoided if they weren't pretty much the only thing to do in the game... like, any kind of quests apart from help Gulliver find his bits and help Whisp find his bits.Basically the only thing to do is fish, craft, catch bugs, shop and those things take 5x as much time and 5x as many button clicks as they need to (even keeping the immersive chatty nature some might like) and all interactions are repetitive, there's no variation.None of the game-play is fluid, very little is intuitive and that 'what's the point' feeling creeps in very quickly.If you want crafting, smooth multi-play, adventure etc...

I have seen this series progress since the first North American release on the Gamecube and to me, it seems like it just gets better and better. In previous games, it would feel like you are the only character who really matters. Animals would hardly interact with each other or their environments and New Horizons is a breath of fresh air in that department. It is hard to find a time when the animals won't be doing something, whether it's talking to each other, going fishing, or even reading a book. To me, this adds a much better feeling of connectedness between everything on the island. Multiplayer lends itself to getting stale pretty quickly right now, but I don't see that as a criticism that detracts significantly from the overall experience of the game. What you get from this game is a relaxing experience that stands on its own as one of the best in the series.… Expand	2020-05-01

The local multiplayer is even worse, only the first player on the island can experience the full game, players who join afterward are extremely limited in what they can do.THE UGLY: Playing together locally is even worse, with players joining the main player basically being limited to picking up items and being dragged around the island. The game is also limited to only one island per console with no ability to backup or transfer your island to another console. This means if your switch is lost, stolen or broken you have to completely start over, this is completely unacceptable in 2020, not sure how Nintendo launched a flagship title without the ability for cloud saves or console transfers.FINAL VERDICT: The game is fun and offers a lot to do, but there are some massive drawbacks that make it hard to recommend currently, do yourself a favor and wait for Nintendo to correct some of these glaring faults.… Expand	2020-05-01

I don't think the developers tested the game cuz if they did, they'd realize how tedious and boring so many of the aspects are. Also after you unlock terraforming, you can only break or build one thing at a time and the animation takes about two seconds per block. It took me half an hour to make some simple waterfalls and cliffs when it would have taken a fraction of the time if I didn't have to sit through the annoying animation for every block. They easily could've made it so we could break or build multiple things at once but like I said, it feels like the devs intentionally made the game super tedious cuz they thought it would be relaxing which it's not. It's annoying and they would realize if they played the game for more than 2 seconds. The villagers are also boring. In AC on the GameCube, the villagers had personality, felt different and wouldnt immediately treat you like a best friend. In this game, they all basically say the same stuff, they're all overly friendly and they no longer have chores for you in exchange for furniture. On top of that, they rarely interact with items or furniture which they do better in Pocket Camp. That's right, a $60 game has worse villagers than a free mobile game. Also 1 island per switch is the worst move I've seen from Nintendo in a long time and they should've fixed it. I tried to get into this game but whenever I try to catch bugs, fish, build stuff or get bells, the enjoyment is quickly ruined by how boring and monotonous everything is.

The core gameplay is nothing too different from the usual game. Little improvements to the game, like actually having the option to move your home / being presented with a multitude of crafting recipes for decor is very welcome. The number of villagers possible to meet (and invite) is astounding! While not every villager makes a comeback in the game, but a number of characters last seen in the original Animal Crossing finally make a return in this game after not appearing in earlier games.I do find fault with the one island per console thing, but... I think that has been overly addressed to the point where  My main issue with the game is the UI / Camera Layout.Listen, I'm fine with not being able to rotate my camera outside of my house. It really isn't needed. What is needed, however, is the ability to look top-down. Way too many times have I missed a glowing spot because they're hidden behind a building or something. It's great that you've included it with the end-of-game mechanic, which isn't to be named for spoiler warnings, but I think it should become part of the core game mechanic.The DIY crafting menu sucks, and so does the inventory menu. Let's say you're trying to craft items to sell because they make a ton of bells. Sure, you can mash A to speed up the crafting process, but what if you don't want to stress out the button you already spam for fishing? Gotta fork up some money to buy a controller with turbo, or something. I'd much rather have the option to craft multiple items at once. Speaking of multiple items at once, it also wouldn't hurt to change how people divide stacks in your inventory. You need to select the item, and select grab one in order to move separate something from a stack, but only at one at a time. It'd be great if we could indicate how many we would like to separate from said stack to save on time. Also worth mentioning, but I don't think the game's worth $60. I don't have a reasoning behind this, but... I think $50 might be a more appropriate price.With all of that said, I'm not dropping the game. I love it and will keep playing it. It sucks that my little sister can't play the game too, but since I am playing this single-player... I'm fine with this. Hopefully, they can repatch the game to support multiple players in the near future.TL;DR:Pros:- Similar enough to older games- Able to finally move your home.- So many villagers to meet, some returning for the first time in a while!Mixed:- Crafting is cool but kinda tedious.Cons:- Camera angels are kinda annoying to hold.- ONE PROFILE PER CONSOLE.- Controversial opinion, but I don't think it's worth $60.Verdict: Honestly a 7.5/10, but I'll give it an 8.… Expand	2020-05-01

The little animal villagers are extremely adorable and its very wholesome building friendships with them.There are some problems with the game that are complete dealbreakers for people though, like only having one game per console. Luckily that doesn't really affect me, or I would have had a real problem with this game. It would also be good if you could play couch co-op with full functionality for the second player. The second player can't really do much. There are also some problems that should be fixed such as being able to craft multiple things at once. I think there are also some kinks to be worked out with kicking villagers out. There are 3 villagers that I want OUT and I haven't talked to them for a month, and they still won't leave. The only ones that ask to leave are ones that I actually like. So that's just been pretty annoying for me. I also feel like there are several things that could have been added that would have made the game more rewarding in my opinion. I wish there was some factor of skill points that show your fishing experience level, or your friendship level with a villager. This may be getting a little too complicated though, but it's just my preference. Another thing is it's very rare that the villagers or Tom Nook actually asks you to complete any activities such as fetch this specific bug, or make this furniture. This feels like a completely missed opportunity to fulfill requests for the villagers. (I know this is something that is a feature in the game, but for some reason in my experience this opportunity rarely ever pops up). I do wish there were a more things to do in the vein of quests, but I think the seasonal events will keep things interesting for the foreseeable future.It's easy for me to point out all of the faults I have with this game but it's hard to explain why I still love it despite all its faults. It has it's problems, and on paper isn't much to do, but there's just something about it. Overall, it's a very slow burn but it is satisfying to see your island develop from nothing and to your own ideal island aesthetic and friendships.
