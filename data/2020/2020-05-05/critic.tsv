100	Pocket Gamer UK	Animal Crossing; New Horizons, much like its predecessors, operates outside of the boundaries of most games. While the most tension you'll ever feel is while sprinting away from wasps, there's a warmth and comfort in the code which you won't find almost anywhere else.	2020-03-16
100	Forbes	Know that if you’re overwhelmed with the world, stuck inside, or adrift in a life that you know will look totally different next week — get Animal Crossing.	2020-03-16
100	Telegraph	With a game this broad and lengthy, there’s more to discuss than I could fit in one review, but suffice it to say, this a game that Nintendo have clearly worked incredibly hard to get right. It shines at every moment, from the wind rustling through the trees, to the sunset glinting off the water to the jaunty tunes at the start of the day fading into more relaxing melodies in the evening. Add dozens of much needed quality of life features (hello player customisation, autosave, couch co-op, and eight-player online play) and it all adds up to the perfect DIY recipe for the most chilled out, relaxing, and engaging life simulator ever.	2020-03-16
100	VG247	Animal Crossing: New Horizons is everything I hoped it would be, and it’s yet another stellar release that showcases a confident Nintendo at its best. It is excellent, and is easily another must-own Switch title – at least, if you can understand and embrace Animal Crossing’s uniquely lazy pace.	2020-03-16
100	Nintendo Insider	Above all else, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is an unbeatable feel-good experience and an essential purchase for anyone that owns a Nintendo Switch. As heartwarming as it is wholesome, Nintendo has delivered meaningful changes that help to structure your peaceful island existence. Every day has the potential to offer something new, and, thanks to that, it will be a game that many will enjoy investing countless hours (and Bells) in. Oh, and heroically leaping across rivers with the Vault Pole will never get old.	2020-03-16

100	Nintendo Life	Animal Crossing: New Horizons takes Animal Crossing and not only drags it back onto home consoles, but improves upon every single facet imaginable. There's more to do, more to see, more to change, more to mould, and more to love; fans and first-time players are going to find themselves losing hours at a time gathering materials, creating new furniture, and making their island undeniably theirs. Every moment is unashamedly blissful, with excellently-written characters that truly feel alive and an island paradise that gives infinitely back more than you put in. Back when Animal Crossing: New Leaf hit the shelves all those years ago and created a whole new generation of fans, many people were wondering how Nintendo could possibly top it, but here we have our answer. This is a masterpiece that has been well worth waiting for.	2020-03-16

94	Wccftech	Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the biggest reinvention of the series' mechanics and core gameplay loop, and that also makes it the best entry yet. This is a completely new kind of Animal Crossing experience, while retaining everything you loved about the previous games. You'll spend hours catching fish and bugs, making money to pay off your loan, and do it while having more power over how you customise your experience than ever before.

92	IGN Italia	Animal Crossing: New Horizons changes the game in a lot of subtly but meaningful ways, giving it more depth, freedom and a better flow.	2020-03-16
92	COGconnected	I always knew Animal Crossing games as something you played for like, 30 minutes a day at most. Grab some fruit, chat to your neighbors, call it a day. This game will take over your whole dang life, but in a really fun way. If you’ve ever had even a whiff of interest in this franchise, Animal Crossing: New Horizons will be an absolute slam dunk. Don’t sleep on this one for a second.	2020-03-16
91	Nintenderos	Start from scratch on a deserted island, collect resources to help its growth, form a small community, progress to get an idyllic place we dream of and, when we think that there is nothing else on the horizon, millions of players will share with us their own vision of our own story. A different and deep game, something that is undoubtedly a sensation that lovers of video games should experience.	2020-03-16
90	VideoGamer	Animal Crossing: New Horizons is beautiful and peaceful, offering safe harbour from the stresses of everyday life. There’s so much to do and so much to see, so what’s wrong with making a back seat?	2020-03-16
90	Millenium	With fully customizable gameplay and a game experience that changes daily, Animal Crossing New Horizons is the perfect companion for a dream life. Having kept the basics and the principles of the franchise, Nintendo has introduced some great new features that allow even more total immersion in this bubble of tranquility. Whether it's with the ability to shape your island as you wish, more customisation than ever before, or the addition of a crafting system, while keeping the basics of the franchise, this new game fully meets the expectations of fans and will even manage to convert even the most skeptical.	2020-03-16
90	Gamer.nl	The amazing, relaxing gameplay we love is now available in a beautiful new look. The new quests and crafting systems are great for both newcomers and fans of the series and it is great to see Animal Crossing grow without losing its charm.	2020-03-16
90	GamePro Germany	Animal Crossing New Horizons did everything right by jumping on the switch. The controls are pleasant, the crafting is clear and the challenges are so diversified that they will motivate hobbyists and craftsmen for a long time.	2020-03-16
90	Meristation	Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the best entry of the series so far, but it is not the ultimate Animal Crossing yet. There are some minor flaws, but nothing really noticeable. Its quality of life details, the daily routine of grabbing some fruit, chatting to your neighbors or looking for surprises, plus the very new mechanics are so delightful that we can only say good things about one of the most rewarding Nintendo experiences yet.	2020-03-16
90	Gameblog.fr	The fresh thrill of discovering an uninhabited atoll tends to fade once such wild life gets cosier with crafted items, buildings, shops and incoming residents, until it looks like a village from the previous iterations. But the larger size of this wholly reshapable island, the customization's vertiginous level and the improved community interactions create an even more fertile ecosystem, hence Animal Crossing can slowly though decidedly stare further, towards New Horizons, equipped with an ever updating NookPhone.	2020-03-16
90	Game Informer	New Horizons has a lot to see and do, and much of the joy comes from discovering it on your own. I still get a kick out of the real-time elements, such as how a construction project that takes a day to complete takes a real day’s time to finish, or how the various merchants keep actual store hours. That little hook keeps me excited to check back in later when I end each session. Animal Crossing: New Horizons has something new to experience every day, and, best of all, it’s built on a foundation of joy and earnestness that’s all too rare. If the tradeoff is that I have to craft a few fishing poles, I guess it’s worth it in the end.	2020-03-16
90	USgamer	Animal Crossing: New Leaf remains the pinnacle of the series, but New Horizons brings with it a bunch welcome quality of life changes, such as terraforming the island to your every whim. The addition of crafting isn't a burden as I worried it would be. In fact, it becomes a fun objective to work toward, effectively diversifying the usual chores of selling bugs and fish to pay your never-waning debts to that rascally raccoon. With real-world headlines more harrowing than ever, there's never been a better time to go on vacation within Animal Crossing: New Horizons.	2020-03-16
90	My Nintendo News	Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a beautifully relaxing title – exactly as it should be. With so much to offer in the coming months, such as seasonal events and new NPC characters we have yet to encounter, it’s a rewarding game that takes pride in its little moments of heart-warming joy. If you’re an Animal Crossing fan, you don’t want to miss this.	2020-03-16
90	XGN	Animal Crossing New Horizons delivers on all fronts. Even though you know what to expect, the game manages to surprise you in meaningful ways that'll keep you playing for hundreds of hours. The localisation could've been better, but that doesn't impact the fun that you're guaranteed to have.	2020-03-16
90	Screen Rant	Nintendo Switch gets another must-own exclusive as Animal Crossing: New Horizons delivers on the expectations of fans without scaring off newcomers.	2020-03-16

90	Eurogamer Italy	Animal Crossing: New Horizons is refined by the technological evolution of the last decade and the experience gathered with New Leaf and the various spin-off titles: the new game has a soul that has always been present in the franchise, but never fully expressed as today . All that remains is to wait for the launch and hope for a far-sighted management of the free updates and (not yet confirmed) microtransactions, crowning a title very close to conceptual and executive perfection.	2020-03-16
90	GamesRadar+	There continues to be nothing quite like Animal Crossing, and New Horizons proves that there's life in the old Nook yet.	2020-03-16

86	Power Unlimited	Under the illusion of a relaxed island existence, this Animal Crossing gives you more to do, experience and build than ever before, all in a thoughtful, pleasant, time-and-time seductive way, making it the ultimate AC.

85	Everyeye.it	Animal Crossing reaffirms how important it is also to have an alternative: a welcoming and relaxed space where to stop. And relax. And breathe ...	2020-03-16
85	Jeuxvideo.com	The series has managed to evolve without betraying the spirit of the previous parts: to spend peaceful days and do what we want, without pressure. Possibly, New Horizons is the breath of fresh air we needed.	2020-03-16
85	3DJuegos	Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a right evolution in the series, based on customization, looting and crafting. Definitely, the biggest title in the AC franchise, but also a very conservative one.	2020-03-16
85	Destructoid	Based on what I have been able to experience, it's what I've wanted Animal Crossing to be for many years.	2020-03-16

82	IGN Spain	Animal Crossing debuts on Nintendo Switch with New Horizons, a game that draws heavily from users of previous titles feedback, but with too slow a progression in comparison.	2020-03-16
80	4Players.de	Nintendo's island adventure can be boring at times, but also tremendously recreative – in any case it is unbelievably charming.	2020-03-16
80	Post Arcade (National Post)	It’s a blissfully lighthearted and colourful game filled with charm, humour — I giggled aloud the first time I caught a black bass, described in-game as “the most metal of all fish” — and a much needed sense of normalcy that comes at a time when we could all use a little pick-me-up.	2020-03-16
80	GAMINGbible	While New Horizons doesn't do much - or anything at all, really - to win over anyone who didn't get Animal Crossing previously, veteran fans and interested newcomers alike will find 2020's sweetest, most wholesome game yet.	2020-03-16
90	GRYOnline.pl	In case of Animal Crossing, a dull slogan like this game is addictive becomes true. I have been, with utmost pleasure, fishing, and planting flowers; I have decorated my house and talked to the residents of the island, and it was all fun. And even though I've spend more than 5o hours with New Horizons, there are still lots I of things haven't seen. If you own a Switch and like a splendid grind, you simply have to play it.	2020-03-17
80	Digital Trends	New Horizons is packed with delight. It’s fun, with rare cross-generation appeal. The deserted island theme had some worried the latest entry would stray from the traditional model, but those fears should quickly be alleviated. It does, however, allow for new experiences and prevent the series from feeling stale almost 20 years after its debut.	2020-03-17
100	Cubed3	As in the past games, this is rich with culture, community, humour, and charm. There's a reason why the series has such a dedicated fan base - and with such hype, there's always the worry that the expectations may not match reality. However, New Horizons exceeds expectations in every way. It proves to be the ideal gateway game for many people and, with added touches of magic, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is perfect for players old and new.	2020-03-18

So relax, hop on that plane, and enjoy your new life on the beach, in the woods, or even by the river. The choice is yours.	2020-03-22
95	Pure Nintendo	Animal Crossing: New Horizons hit every checkbox for me. It’s clear in their handling of New Horizons that Nintendo truly cares about this series and understands its value to its audience.	2020-03-23
90	Games.cz	Animal Crossing: New Horizons will easily become your lovely new daily routine. Every day you’ll be coming back and discovering something new, you won’t be feeling alone even in sinlgeplayer and you’ll become a part of a community that will transform a tropical island into a paradise on Earth (just forget about the couch coop, though).	2020-03-23
90	Carole Quintaine	Animal Crossing New Horizons is simply adorable! Its world full of colors, its cute look and its multitude of possibilities make it an absolutely awesome and extremely generous game. The crafting allows a very satisfying experience, you can do just about anything on your island and transform it radically at your leisure. This exotic adventure is a real piece of paradise and the feeling of freedom is total.	2020-03-23
85	NintendoWorldReport	Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a whole new approach to the series. While it has created some downsides, I can't understate how great this game has come together. The overall flow has been expanded with Nook Miles goals, DIY projects, and very lively animal friends. What I'm impressed by is how I was never left without something to do, and how I could see the world improve around me. There are a few things that New Horizons could have explained better, but they are also part of the more free flowing future that the franchise wants. Even after all these years, there is a daily routine that I hold dear and makes me adore the various elements that glue this game together. It has been sharply dialed up to eleven, without disagrading any newcomers.	2020-03-23
80	JeuxActu	Animal Crossing New Horizons is a good entry in the series with it's new features like terraforming and crafting, but overall it's not a revolution, and it surely won't convince gamers who dislike the IP.	2020-03-23
98	Cheat Code Central	Animal Crossing: New Horizons could end up being the most important game of 2020. It certainly will be one of its best. It will be the coping mechanism that helps people both recover from and overcome the dark things around them.	2020-03-24
93	LevelUp	Thanks to new customization possibilities, a lot of classic charm and many QOL improvements, Animal Crossing: New Horizons stands as the best of the franchise so far. This game builds a community sense in different levels, something that we need at present time.	2020-03-24
90	Shacknews	There’s no arguing that Animal Crossing isn’t for everyone. But, if you’ve been a fan of the series before, and you’re looking for something juicy to sink your teeth into, then New Horizons is everything you could ever want from the franchise and then some.	2020-03-24
90	GameSpew	There has never been a better time for a new Animal Crossing game to arrive. It cannot fix what’s going on in the world right now, but Animal Crossing: New Horizons gives us the joyful, meditative escape that so many of us desperately need right now. Whether you’re young or old, you’ll find something to like. What isn’t to love about customising your dream island and being able to sit on a bench by the beach, listening to the waves, just because you can? Nothing I can think of, that’s for sure.	2020-03-24
80	GameCrate	New Horizons is a great evolution for the Animal Crossing franchise. As always Nintendo has integrated some amazing innovations into the formula, but in the process made some really weird design decisions that detract from the fun.	2020-03-24
90	Digitally Downloaded	We all need games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and while I don't think it's perfect by any means, and some of the new elements this time around come at the expense of what made previous titles so wonderful, the winning charm is still there in full. This will be Nintendo's biggest game of 2020, and with good reason - everyone who has been looking forward to it will be absolutely delighted by what Nintendo has delivered.	2020-03-25
90	Edge Magazine	To play New Horizons is to retreat to a fairer, kinder place, where even the supposed bad guy is a philanthropist who gives you interest-free loans you can pay off at your leisure. Animal Crossing has always been a pleasure; never has it felt quote so essential. [Issue#344, p.110]	2020-03-26
90	Worth Playing	Animal Crossing: New Horizons offers players a plethora of things to do at a very measured pace. The slow build does well to lull players into a cadence and get them used to some of the basics before going full bore — while still managing to be a relaxing jaunt. Solo play is near-perfect with the new additions that make this feel different from previous outings, while multiplayer is a treat even if some of the methods can feel slightly archaic. Ultimately, this is the kind of long-term game you want to get addicted to because it has a wealth of things to discover and do.	2020-03-26
90	Gamer.no	Quotation forthcoming.	2020-03-26
100	Switch Player	Time apart can be good for the soul and New Horizons is proof of just that. Seven years in the making, this is the definitive Animal Crossing experience. This is as close as it gets to Animal Crossing perfection.	2020-03-27

100	We Got This Covered	Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the perfect getaway from daily life, putting players in a serene world where the only thing that matters is catching fish and arranging furniture.

100	DarkStation	Sometimes, playing a video game really is the best distraction from the real world.

95	GamingTrend	Animal Crossing: New Horizons is easily the best Animal Crossing game to date. This life simulator is the most immersive, feature-filled, and customizable to date, having exponentially amplified all the charm and addicting qualities of New Leaf. A must have for any fan of the series, or anyone who simply needs a distraction from the current state of the real world.	2020-03-30
90	Twinfinite	New Horizons is the definitive Animal Crossing experience—that much is clear after a relatively short amount of time spent with it. And with the promise of future holiday updates, it’s guaranteed that fans both new and old will return to their islands again and again for many years to come.	2020-03-30
90	BaziCenter	Animal Crossing: New Horizons is yet another title that you can clearly see Nintendo's mark on it. It aims only to entertain, and it succeeds. If you are looking to distant yourself from all the violence and adrenaline that most games on the market are offering right now, then this is a perfect match for you.	2020-03-31
90	FNintendo	Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the premiere of the series on the Nintendo Switch and it makes the player feel right at home, whether newcomers or the more experienced ones.

100	Player 2	If you’ve never played Animal Crossing before, New Horizons will suck you into its ostensibly calm island world like nothing else. For series veterans, you will eagerly surrender to this whirlpool, only to emerge in time for the next entry in the series.	2020-04-02
100	Gaming Age	Being able to play the game with family in the same household may require a bit much (multiple Switch consoles and copies of the game) but when you get it all up and running, it is a great way to spend your time stuck at home. I’ve spent hours with the game every day since launch, and have yet to come close to being exhausted with it, and seemingly never run out of things to do. So, if for some reason you have yet to pick this one up, I’d definitely recommend doing so.	2020-04-02
90	Malditos Nerds	If Animal Crossing was always a very simple concept with very complex features, New Horizons is a toy hammer with the capacity to forge a universe, powered by each player's imagination. It's must-have game in the library of every Nintendo Switch user that perfectly exemplifies Nintendo's idiosyncrasy. Similar to a bonsai, It offers something that can be cared for and appreciated every single day.	2020-04-02
90	DualShockers	“New Horizons makes it easy, appealing, and effortless to hop back in each day and find something new to do and to expand your island even more.	2020-04-03
90	Game Rant	Animal Crossing: New Horizons refines the formula, but doesn't dramatically shake it up. This is still a laid-back game that ultimately lets the player choose what they're going to do at any given moment, but those choices are still primarily limited to what existed in the prior games.	2020-04-05
90	GameSpot	New Horizons has a slower pace even than other Animal Crossing games, and at times, that can feel unnecessarily restrictive. But there's still plenty to do, and each of those activities feeds into the next brilliantly for a rewarding and relentlessly cheerful experience. New Horizons certainly came at the right time, and its strengths are particularly comforting right now. I'm as excited to see what random events await me each morning as I am glad to have it during hard times, and that's sure to keep me coming back for the foreseeable future.	2020-04-05
95	Nintendo Enthusiast	Animal Crossing: New Horizons ultimately helped me better appreciate the importance of being able to spend time with others. With or without a pandemic, this is one of the best games to have graced Nintendo Switch yet. It’s the purest and most engaging form of Eguchi’s vision, and there’s an unparalleled belonging and meaning that’ll draw me back in for a long time to come.	2020-04-06
90	Gameplanet	New Horizons is the near-perfect installment ahead of the 20th anniversary of the series. There is so much to do in this game, and Nintendo has really pushed the limits for the series with the amount of creative freedom they’ve handed over to the player. The only thing that lets it down is the clunkiness of an otherwise delightful multiplayer feature. Still, this is exactly the kind of game I want to be stuck at home with.	2020-04-06
90	Noisy Pixel	Animal Crossing: New Horizons ends up being worth the wait between mainline entries. Even with some omissions and issues with the one island per system, the streamlined gameplay and customization show just how much this series has grown over the years. There is so much to do here that it will easily keep me busy crafting, customizing, and collecting for months if not years to come.	2020-04-06
80	New Game Network	New Horizons draws from familiar Animal Crossing elements while building upon and redecorating them with its fun island motif. It's still fairly minimalistic, but I liken it to a warm honey tea - it may be simple and subdued, but still provides a relaxing, enjoyable experience.	2020-04-06
90	App Trigger	While Animal Crossing: New Horizons has some design annoyance, like conversation menus and online play, there’s so much that’s good that it heavily outweighs the bad. With an addictive gameplay loop and the ability to play however you want, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a system seller — a great game for veterans of the series, newcomers, gamers and non-gamers. And one that the whole family can enjoy.	2020-04-07
80	M3	Initially we were a little skeptical of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Our expectations were so high, but we got bored by the repetitive tasks. However, after about five hours something happens with the game. The Animal Crossing spirit engulfs us for real, and we reach for our Switch as soon as we get the chance. Not to put us in for hours, but just to check the location of our island a few minutes at a time. It is a game that we don't love intensely, but rather a game that follows us through the days. And we suspect that will be the case for a long while.	2020-04-07
80	AusGamers	Despite early frustration, Animal Crossing: New Horizon is not only a game I’ll be returning to but also a life worth revisiting. With time comes maturity and now that I know the rules and how to break them each visit can be a holiday or a monetary expedition to create a hoarder’s paradise. Animal Crossing: New Horizons lets you do what you want, at your own pace, as long as you’ve got the Bells to pay for it.	2020-04-07
100	GameSkinny	The latest Animal Crossing is also the best, full of life, charm, and near-endless ways to make your very own island paradise.	2020-04-08
90	The Sydney Morning Herald	This is by far the nicest iteration of the game to date, with both more guided objectives and more options for self-led tomfoolery, wrapped in a much higher definition version of the familiar rustic-meets-plushies visual and audio motifs.	2020-04-08
90	Attack of the Fanboy	It's an exceptional game, with few faults to speak of, and players who have even the slightest inkling of interest should check it out as soon as possible.	2020-04-08
90	Easy Allies	Two weeks worth of New Horizons makes us want even more. Several parts of the day-to-day grind should be accelerated or skipped, but so much of it has already been impressively streamlined compared to prior entries. The series has been a welcoming companion on any console, but it feels especially at home on the Switch, whether you’re visiting a friend’s wonderland online, taking your tropical getaway on the road, checking your progress first thing in the morning, or gathering some last-minute supplies before you turn in for the night. This is the best Animal Crossing has ever been, and this virtual paradise is a wonderful place to escape to.	2020-04-08

80	MMORPG.com	As much as I love Animal Crossing, I suppose I expected just a lot more than what we’ve seen in New Leaf and Pocket Camp. I would even throw my hands up in elation if Gyroids made their triumphant return as audible and visual furniture once again.  Despite some of these minor misgivings, and lost opportunities in my estimation, Animal Crossing: New Horizons delivers on an island building simulation that will not disappoint. If you’re headed to the island, say “Hi” to Nook for me.	2020-04-10

90	Hardcore Gamer	Animal Crossing has always been a series where every little thing leads to something productive. Doing nothing and staring off into the sky is relaxing, decorating houses is fun and catching critters feels rewarding. There’s never been a real “point” to Animal Crossing but that’s what makes it enjoyable, as every person can enjoy and do what they like at their own pace. New Horizons nails this feeling more than ever, with so many options and lots of things to collect and enjoy. While it’s easy to play in short bursts, it’s often hard to stop playing when ideas keep coming and experimentation is so much fun when there’s little to no consequences. New Horizons is by far the best Animal Crossing and anyone looking for a way to relax or get creative should not miss out.	2020-04-13
