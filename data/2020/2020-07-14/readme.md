# Astronaut database

The data this week comes from [Mariya Stavnichuk and Tatsuya Corlett](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/86tsnnbv2w/1). 

This [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214552420300444) talks about the data set in greater detail.

> This database contains publically available information about all astronauts who participated in space missions before 15 January 2020 collected from NASA, Roscosmos, and fun-made websites. The provided information includes full astronaut name, sex, date of birth, nationality, military status, a title and year of a selection program, and information about each mission completed by a particular astronaut such as a year, ascend and descend shuttle names, mission and extravehicular activity (EVAs) durations.

It may be interesting to also use the [Space Launches dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-01-15) from TidyTuesday 2019, week 3.

There is also a [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cumulative_spacewalk_records) on cumulative spacewalk records - you should be able to create the same dataset with the astronaut database and the `eva_hrs_mission` column.

To get that data in, use `tidytuesdayR::tt_load("2019", week = 3)`.

### Get the data here

```{r}
# Get the Data

# Read in with tidytuesdayR package 
# Install from CRAN via: install.packages("tidytuesdayR")
# This loads the readme and all the datasets for the week of interest

# Either ISO-8601 date or year/week works!

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-07-14')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, week = 29)

astronauts <- tuesdata$astronauts

# Or read in the data manually

astronauts <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-07-14/astronauts.csv')

```

### Cleaning Script

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(knitr)

astronauts <- read_csv("data/astronauts.csv") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(number)) %>%  # remove last row (all values are NA)
  mutate(
    sex = if_else(sex == "M", "male", "female"),
    military_civilian = if_else(military_civilian == "Mil", "military", "civilian")
  )
```
