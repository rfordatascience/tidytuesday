# Caribou Location Tracking

This data tracks [woodland caribou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boreal_woodland_caribou) in northern British Columbia, a Canadian province. It consists of almost 250,000 location tags of 260 caribou, from 1988 to 2016.

h/t to [Alex Cookson](https://twitter.com/alexcookson) for preparing this week's data!

The tracking was part of a study prepared in 2014 by the [B.C. Ministry of Environment & Climate Change](https://gov.bc.ca/env) to inform the management and recovery of the species, which is [classified as "Vulnerable"](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/29742/22167140) on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) [Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org/).

"Deployment" refers to when the animal was fitted with a location-tracking tag.
