# Global Student to Teacher Ratios

"The UNESCO Institute of Statistics collects country-level data on the number of teachers, teacher-to-student ratios, and related figures. You can download the data or explore it in UNESCOâ€™s eAtlas of Teachers or their interactive visualization of teacher supply in Asia"

There is even more education data at the country level available at [UNESCO Institute of Statistics](http://data.uis.unesco.org/index.aspx?queryid=180).

"Reducing class size to increase student achievement is an approach that has been tried, debated, and analyzed for several decades. The premise seems logical: with fewer students to teach, teachers can coax better performance from each of them. But what does the research show?Some researchers have not found a connection between smaller classes and higher student achievement, but most of the research shows that when class size reduction programs are well-designed and implemented in the primary grades (K-3), student achievement rises as class size drops."
