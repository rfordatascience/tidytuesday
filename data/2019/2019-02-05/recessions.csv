The economy began to recover in the mid 30s with gold inflow expanding the money supply and improving expectations but double dipped during the Recession of 1937-38. The ultimate recovery has been credited to monetary policy and monetary expansion.[51]"

19.0%(1938)[52]",03.4−18.2%,"The Recession of 1937 is only considered minor when compared to the Great Depression, but is otherwise among the worst recessions of the 20th century. Three explanations are offered as causes for the recession:  the tight fiscal policy resulting from an attempt to balance the budget after New Deal spending, the tight monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, and the declining profits of businesses led to a reduction in business investment.[53]"
Recession of 1945,1945Feb 1945-Oct 1945,088 months,0806 years8 months,05.25.2%[52](1946),12.7−12.7%,"The decline in government spending at the end of World War II led to an enormous drop in gross domestic product, making this technically a recession. This was the result of demobilization and the shift from a wartime to peacetime economy. The post-war years were unusual in a number of ways (unemployment was never high) and this era may be considered a ""sui generis end-of-the-war recession"".[54][55]"
Recession of 1949,1948Nov 1948-Oct 1949,1111 months,0373 years1 month,07.97.9%(Oct 1949),01.7−1.7%,"The 1948 recession was a brief economic downturn; forecasters of the time expected much worse, perhaps influenced by the poor economy in their recent lifetimes.[56] The recession also followed a period of monetary tightening.[34]"
Recession of 1953,1953July 1953-May 1954,1010 months,0453 years9 months,06.16.1%(Sep 1954),02.6−2.6%,"After a post-Korean War inflationary period, more funds were transferred to national security. In 1951, the Federal Reserve reasserted its independence from the U.S. Treasury and in 1952, the Federal Reserve changed monetary policy to be more restrictive because of fears of further inflation or of a bubble forming.[34][57][58]"
Recession of 1958,1957Aug 1957-April 1958,088 months,0393 years3 months,07.57.5%(July 1958),03.1−3.7%,"Monetary policy was tightened during the two years preceding 1957, followed by an easing of policy at the end of 1957. The budget balance resulted in a change in budget surplus of 0.8% of GDP in 1957 to a budget deficit of 0.6% of GDP in 1958, and then to 2.6% of GDP in 1959.[34]"
Recession of 1960–61,1960Apr 1960-Feb 1961,1010 months,0242 years,07.17.1%(May 1961),01.6−1.6%,"Another primarily monetary recession occurred after the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in 1959. The government switched from deficit (or 2.6% in 1959) to surplus (of 0.1% in 1960). When the economy emerged from this short recession, it began the second-longest period of growth in NBER history.[34] The Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow) finally reached its lowest point on Feb. 20, 1961, about 4 weeks after President Kennedy was inaugurated."

At the end of the expansion, inflation was rising, possibly a result of increased deficits. This relatively mild recession coincided with an attempt to start closing the budget deficits of the Vietnam War (fiscal tightening) and the Federal Reserve raising interest rates (monetary tightening).[34]"
1973–75 recession,1973Nov 1973-Mar 1975,161 year4 months,0363 years,09.0 9.0%(May 1975),03.2−3.2%,"The 1973 oil crisis, a quadrupling of oil prices by OPEC, coupled with the 1973–1974 stock market crash led to a stagflation recession in the United States.[59][60]"
1980 recession,1980Jan 1980-July 1980,066 months,0584 years10 months,07.8 7.8%(July 1980),02.2−2.2%,"The NBER considers a very short recession to have occurred in 1980, followed by a short period of growth and then a deep recession. Unemployment remained relatively elevated in between recessions. The recession began as the Federal Reserve, under Paul Volcker, raised interest rates dramatically to fight the inflation of the 1970s. The early '80s are sometimes referred to as a ""double-dip"" or ""W-shaped"" recession.[34][61]"
1981–1982 recession,1981July 1981-Nov 1982,161 year4 months,0121 year,10.8 10.8%(Nov 1982),02.7−2.7%,"The Iranian Revolution sharply increased the price of oil around the world in 1979, causing the 1979 energy crisis. This was caused by the new regime in power in Iran, which exported oil at inconsistent intervals and at a lower volume, forcing prices up. Tight monetary policy in the United States to control inflation led to another recession. The changes were made largely because of inflation carried over from the previous decade because of the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis.[62][63]"
Early 1990s recession in the United States,1990July 1990-Mar 1991,088 months,0927 years8 months,07.8 7.8%(June 1992),01.4−1.4%,"After the lengthy peacetime expansion of the 1980s, inflation began to increase and the Federal Reserve responded by raising interest rates from 1986 to 1989. This weakened but did not stop growth, but some combination of the subsequent 1990 oil price shock, the debt accumulation of the 1980s, and growing consumer pessimism combined with the weakened economy to produce a brief recession.[64][65][66]"
Early 2000s recession,2001Mar 2001-Nov 2001,088 months,12010 years,06.3 6.3%(June 2003),00.3−0.3%,"The 1990s were the longest period of growth in American history. The collapse of the speculative dot-com bubble, a fall in business outlays and investments, and the September 11th attacks,[67] brought the decade of growth to an end. Despite these major shocks, the recession was brief and shallow.[68]"

Falling housing-related assets contributed to a global financial crisis, even as oil and food prices soared. The crisis led to the failure or collapse of many of the United States' largest financial institutions: Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, Citi Bank and AIG, as well as a crisis in the automobile industry. The government responded with an unprecedented $700 billion bank bailout and $787 billion fiscal stimulus package. The National Bureau of Economic Research declared the end of this recession over a year after the end date.[73] The Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow) finally reached its lowest point on March 9, 2009.[74]"
