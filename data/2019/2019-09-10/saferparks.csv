The interior connection of the light fixture to the center tower bent, but stayed connected. This allowed the other end of the light fixture to fall down into the path of the moving passenger cars. The ride was moving at full speed when the light detached. The operator manually moved the ride time dial to off, which cut the power and allowed the ride to start slowing down on its own. She told police she did not activate the emergency brake because she didn't know what that lever was. As the ride slowed, two carnival employees jumped the fence to help patrons, but became victims of the accident. One (20yo male) was struck by one of the ride's passenger cars and thrown to the ground. Another (35yo male) attempted to jump on the ride and manually grab the ligh fixture. As he neared the swinging light, he was pulled or knocked down to the ground.

The ride had been modified with seatbelts per NY state regulations imposed after a child was ejected from a Wacky Worm in that state.

As an attendant was assisting a family out of one of the ride's two cars, the operator decided to step out of the control booth. On his way out, he accidentally bumped into the control panel and the ride jolted into motion. Although the ride had an e-stop button, he panicked and began turning other switches. This resulted in an acceleration of the ride before it came to a stop. When the ride accelerated, the attendant was struck and injured by the moving car and the family, who had already removed their restraints, fell to the ride's metal platform. Some were also struck by the car after they ejected. Investigators determined that the ride had originally been designed so that it was inoperable when restraints were unlatched, but that feature had been malfunctioning and so the owner ordered the operator to bypass the control system using a wire jumper. The owner was arrested and charged with assault.","5 people were hospitalized (4 patrons and one attendant) with injuries to brain, skull, neck, and spine.",https://saferparksdata.org/sites/default/files/accident_reports/CPSC-NC-2013-10-24.pdf,Fall: ejection/fall from ride,1,1,1,
