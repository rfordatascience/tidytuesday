This week we are exploring data from the [Henley Passport Index API](api.henleypassportindex.com/api/v3/countries). 
The [Henley Passport Index](https://www.henleyglobal.com/passport-index/about) is produced by Henley & Partners and captures 
the number of countries to which travelers in possession of each passport in the world may enter visa free. 


> For each travel destination, if no visa is required for passport holders from a country or territory, then a score with value = 1 is 
created for that passport. A score with value = 1 is also applied if passport holders can obtain a visa on arrival, a visitor’s permit, 
or an electronic travel authority (ETA) when entering the destination. These visa-types require no pre-departure government approval, 
because of the specific visa-waiver programs in place. Where a visa is required, or where a passport holder has to obtain a government-approved 
electronic visa (e-Visa) before departure, a score with value = 0 is assigned. A score with value = 0 is also assigned if passport 
holders need pre-departure government approval for a visa on arrival, a scenario we do not consider ‘visa-free’. The total score for 
each passport is equal to the number of destinations for which no visa is required (value = 1), under the conditions defined above.

Henley & Partners update the  [Global Passport Index rankings](https://www.henleyglobal.com/passport-index/ranking) each month 
and [changes to the US passport rank](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/07/22/travel/world-most-powerful-passports-july-2025) 
captured media attention recently. 

- Which countries have made the most dramatic improvements in passport power? Which passports have lost the most visa-free access?
- Do countries with stronger trade relationships tend to offer mutual visa-free access?
- Did the COVID-19 pandemic affect passport rankings, particularly for countries that implemented strict border controls?
- How does political instability or economic crisis impact passport strength?
