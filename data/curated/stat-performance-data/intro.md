The World Bank has developed Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI) to monitor the statistical performance of countries. The SPI focuses on five key dimensions of a countryâ€™s statistical performance: (i) data use, (ii) data services, (iii) data products, (iv) data sources, and (v) data infrastructure. This set of countries covers 99 percent of the world population. The data extend from 2016-2023, with some indicators going back to 2004.

> The purpose of the SPI is to help countries assess and improve the performance of their statistical systems.

In relation to these indicators, it should be noted that:

> Small differences between countries should not be highlighted since they can reflect imprecision arising from the currently available indicators rather than meaningful differences in performance.

* How has the statistical performance of a country changed over time?
* Is statistical performance related to a country's income level or population?
* Which pillar do countries score lowest in?
