This week we're seeing how [David Robinson has explored TidyTuesday data](https://github.com/dgrtwo/data-screencasts) in his [YouTube screencasts](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL19ev-r1GBwkuyiwnxoHTRC8TTqP8OEi8&si=jGBo0bcarEPV6cnn)!
Thanks to [Bryan Shalloway](https://github.com/brshallo) for the suggestion, the [{funspotr} package](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/), and the [blog posts about how to use funspotr](https://www.bryanshalloway.com/2022/01/18/identifying-r-functions-packages-used-in-github-repos/) (including [this one about making network graphs with the data](https://www.bryanshalloway.com/2022/03/17/network-plots-of-code-collections-funspotr-part-3/)).

> The goal of funspotr (R function spotter) is to make it easy to identify which R functions and packages are used in files and projects. It was initially written to create reference tables of the functions and packages used in a few popular github repositories.

What are David's most-used functions?
Can you find relationships between functions used and the variable types (using the [{ttmeta} package](https://r4ds.github.io/ttmeta/))?
How does his function graph compare to your own?
