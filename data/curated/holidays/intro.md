This week we're exploring how global holidays impact seasonal human mobility. We found the data via the article ["Global holiday datasets for understanding seasonal human mobility and population dynamics" by Shengjie Lai (et al)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01120-z) (thank you to @lgibson7 for finding the dataset).

> Public and school holidays have important impacts on population mobility and dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales, subsequently affecting the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and many socioeconomic activities. However, worldwide data on public and school holidays for understanding their changes across regions and years have not been assembled into a single, open-source and multitemporal dataset. To address this gap, an open access archive of data on public and school holidays in 2010â€“2019 across the globe at daily, weekly, and monthly timescales was constructed. Airline passenger volumes across 90 countries from 2010 to 2018 were also assembled to illustrate the usage of the holiday data for understanding the changing spatiotemporal patterns of population movements.
