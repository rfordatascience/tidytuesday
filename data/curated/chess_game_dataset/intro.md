The chess dataset this week comes from Lichess.org via Kaggle/Mitchell J.

> This is a set of just over 20,000 games collected from a selection of users on the site Lichess.org.

Use the data to explore -

1. What the common opening moves? By ranks?
2. How many turns does a game last based on player ranking?
3. What move patterns explain the game outcome?
