This week we’re exploring **EuroLeague Basketball**, the premier men’s club basketball competition in Europe.  

The dataset contains information on EuroLeague teams, including their country, home city, arena, seating capacity, and historical performance (Final Four appearances and titles won).  

The dataset is curated from publicly available sources such as Wikipedia and official EuroLeague records, and was packaged in the [EuroleagueBasketball R package](https://github.com/natanast/EuroleagueBasketball), with documentation available at [natanast.github.io/EuroleagueBasketball](https://natanast.github.io/EuroleagueBasketball/).

> "The EuroLeague is the top-tier European professional basketball club competition, widely regarded as the most prestigious competition in European basketball." — EuroLeague

Some questions you might explore with this dataset:  
- Which countries are most represented in the EuroLeague?  
- How do arena capacities compare across teams and countries?  In R, the `readr::parse_number()` function might be helpful here.
- Which clubs have been the most successful historically?
