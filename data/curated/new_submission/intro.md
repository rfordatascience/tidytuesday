This week we're exploring a curated collection of recipes collected from Allrecipes.com!
The data this week comes from the [tastyR package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tastyR) (a dataset assembled from Allrecipes.com) and was prepared for analysis in R. Fields have been cleaned and standardized where possible to make comparisons and visual exploration straightforward.

> A collection of recipe datasets scraped from https://www.allrecipes.com/, containing two complementary datasets: `allrecipes` with 14,426 general recipes, and `cuisines` with 2,218 recipes categorized by country of origin. Both datasets include comprehensive recipe information such as ingredients, nutritional facts (calories, fat, carbs, protein), cooking times (preparation and cooking), ratings, and review metadata. All data has been cleaned and standardized, ready for analysis.

- Which authors are most successful: who is most prolific, who has the highest average ratings or popularity, and do top authors specialize by cuisine, ingredient, or recipe length?
- Is there a relationship between prep/cook time and average rating?
- Which recipe categories or cuisines tend to have the highest average ratings and review counts?
- Which recipes are the most "actionable" â€” high rating with low total time?
