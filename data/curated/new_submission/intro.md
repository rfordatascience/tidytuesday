<!-- 
Describe the dataset. See previous weeks for the general format of the
description. The description is the part of the readme.md file above "The Data";
everything else will be filled in from the other md files in this directory +
automatic scripts. We usually include brief introduction along the lines of
"This week we're exploring DATASET" or "The dataset this week comes from 
SOURCE".
-->

The datasets this week come from the paper "[Sex Ratio Bias Triggers Demographic Suicide in a Dense Tortoise Population](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.70296).
This topic seemed so interesting that even media like the New York Times picked it up:
[Constant Sexual Aggression Drives Female Tortoises to Walk Off Cliffs](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/14/science/tortoises-island-sex-cliff.html).

<!-- Add a quote from the source, starting lines with a ">" character, like 
this:
> Plant traits are critical to plant form and function — including growth, 
> survival and reproduction — and therefore shape fundamental aspects of
> population and ecosystem dynamics as well as ecosystem services. Here, we 
> present a global species-level compilation of key functional traits for palms 
> (Arecaceae), a plant family with keystone importance in tropical and 
> subtropical ecosystems.
-->

> In an exceptionally dense island population of Hermann's tortoises 
> in Lake Prespa in  North Macedonia, sexually coercive males 
> dramatically overnumber  females, inflict severe copulatory injuries 
> and put them at risk  of fatal falls from the island plateau's sheer 
> rock faces. Harassed  females are emaciated, reproduce less frequently,
> produce smaller  clutches and have lower annual survival rates compared 
> to females from a neighbouring mainland population. Sixteen years of 
> capture-recapture data reveal an ongoing extinction event and predict
> that the last island female will die in 2083. 

<!--
Optional: Add questions that users should try to answer. For example:
- How does the sizes of the different species of palms vary across sub families?
- Which fruit colors occur most often?
-->

- Did more recaptures happened in spring or summer? Does it seem easier to recapture male or female tortoises?
- What are the differences among tortoises from the mainland vs the ones from the island in terms of body mass or carapace length?
