This week we're exploring August and September chess player rating data from FIDE (the International Chess Federation). Monthly data files are published on the [FIDE website](https://www.fide.com/fide-september-2025-rating-list-vincent-keymer-debuts-in-top-10-open/).

A chess rating (Elo) is an estimate of a player's strength relative to other players. If a player performs better or worse than expected, their rating increases or decreases accordingly.

> The September 2025 rating list was shaped primarily by results from 
> the Sinquefield Cup, Quantbox Chennai Grand Masters, 61st International Akiba Rubinstein Chess Festival, 
> and the Spanish League Honor Division 2025 â€“ a Swiss team tournament held in Linares.

- Which players showed the greatest improvement from August to September?
- Which federations have the most number of titled players?
- How did the rankings of the top male or female players change?
- Who are the top youth players?
