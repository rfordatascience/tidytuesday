This week we're exploring books from Project Gutenberg and the {[https://docs.ropensci.org/gutenbergr/](gutenbergr)} R package!

> [{gutenbergr} allows you to] Download and process public domain works in the 
> Project Gutenberg collection <https://www.gutenberg.org/>. Includes metadata 
> for all Project Gutenberg works, so that they can be searched and retrieved.

- How many different languages are available in the Project Gutenberg collection? How many books are available in each language?
- Do any authors appear under mroe than one `gutenberg_author_id`?
- How might the {gutenbergr} package authors further refine the data for greater ease-of-use?
