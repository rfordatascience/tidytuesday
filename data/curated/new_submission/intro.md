This week we’re exploring the ferriswheels dataset, compiled by Emil Hvitfeldt as an R package. The dataset brings together information on 74 ferris wheels around the world, including their names, dimensions, passenger capacity, opening dates, construction costs, and operational status. It provides a an opportunity to practice data cleaning, visualization, and handling missing values across a mix of numeric and categorical variables.

> "Ferris wheels are among the most recognizable amusement rides in the world, combining engineering feats with cultural landmarks. This dataset collects details on their size, capacity, and history to support exploration and visualization."


<!--
- Which countries have the tallest wheels, the most cabins, or the longest ride durations?
- How have ferris wheel heights changed over time?
- Do climate‑controlled wheels tend to have higher seating or hourly capacity?
- Mapping ferris wheels globally.
- How do you handle and visualize missing values?
