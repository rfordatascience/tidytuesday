This week we're exploring state-level results for medicare.gov "timely and effective care" measurements.
As of 2025-04-06, the data is available at the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) website](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/apyc-v239).
Thanks to former TidyTuesday team member Tracy Teal (@tracykteal) for the dataset suggestion and the link to [a visualization by Kayla Zhu and Christina Kostandi at the Visual Capitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/mapped-emergency-room-visit-times-by-state/).

> Emergency room wait times vary significantly across the United States 
> depending on factors such as hospital resources, patient volume, and staffing 
> levels, with some states facing delays that can stretch for more than three 
> hours.

- Is there a connection between state populations and wait times?
- Which conditions have the longest wait times? The shortest?
