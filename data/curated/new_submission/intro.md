This week we are exploring the [Billboard Hot 100 Number Ones Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j1AUgtMnjpFTz54UdXgCKZ1i4bNxFjf01ImJ-BqBEt0/edit?gid=1974823090#gid=1974823090).
This workbook contains substantial data about every song to ever top the Billboard Hot 100 
between August 4, 1958 and January 11, 2025. It was compiled by Chris Dalla Riva as he wrote 
the book [Uncharted Territory: What Numbers Tell Us about the Biggest Hit Songs and Ourselves](https://bio.site/uncharted_territory). 
It also often powers his newsletter [Can't Get Much Higher](https://www.cantgetmuchhigher.com/). 

> 7 years ago, I decided that I was going to listen to every number one hit. Along the way, I tracked an absurd amount of information about each song. 
Using that information, I wrote a data-driven history of popular music covering 1958 through today.


- Have #1 hits become shorter over time?
- Does the relation between artist age and chart success change across time?
- Which keys are most common in #1 hits?  Do our key preferences differ by genre?
- What lyrical topics have dominated #1 hits across different decades? 
- How has the prevalence of explicit content changed over time?
