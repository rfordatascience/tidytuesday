This week we are exploring lead levels in water samples collected in Flint, Michigan in 2015. 
The data comes from a paper by [Loux and Gibson (2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/test.12187?casa_token=av3lP7OmqS0AAAAA:QAF3yU5kGzsUkqi1VlXkMlIN8ExolHZBSkdJ3hIHnlptUES57dGVoXjE3qdwPPHtLHNRd9VvX1x8f6VN) 
who advocate for using this data as a teaching example in introductory statistics courses. 

> The Flint lead data provide a compelling example for introducing students to simple univariate descriptive statistics. In addition, they provide examples for discussion
of sampling and data collection, as well as ethical data handling.

The data this week includes samples collected by the Michigan Department of Environment (MDEQ) and data from a citizen science project coordinated by Prof Marc Edwards and colleagues at Virginia Tech. 
Community-sourced samples were collected after concerns were raised about the MDEQ excluding samples from their data. You can read about the ["murky" story behind this data here](https://academic.oup.com/jrssig/article/14/2/16/7029247). 

- How does the distribution of lead levels differ between MDEQ and Virginia Tech datasets?
- How do key statistics (mean, median, 90th percentile) change with/without excluded samples in the MDEQ sample?
