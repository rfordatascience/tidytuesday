This week we're exploring **The Languages of the World**, curated from [Glottolog 5.2.1](https://glottolog.org), an open-access database in linguistics, maintained by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.

> Glottolog is the most comprehensive language database in linguistics, and contains information (names, genealogy, geographical information, endangerment status, etc.) of over 8,000 languages of the world.

-   Which macroareas have the highest concentration of endangered languages?
-   Are language isolates more likely to be endangered?
-   Which language families span the widest geographic range?
-   What geographic patterns emerge when mapping endangered languages?
