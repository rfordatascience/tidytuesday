This week we're exploring the (New York) MTA Permanent Art Catalog! Thank you to Georgios Karamanis ([GitHub](https://github.com/gkaramanis) | [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/karaman.is) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgios-karamanis-a54926153/) for [suggesting this dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues/894). Submit your dataset ideas through our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/.github/dataset_idea.md)!

The [MTA has a dashboard to explore this dataset](https://data.ny.gov/stories/s/u2va-fuuf), but the dashboard is at least partially broken. Can you recreate it in Shiny for R or Python?

> Through the Permanent Art Program, MTA Arts & Design (formerly Arts for Transit) commissions public art that is seen by millions of city-dwellers as well as national and international visitors who use the MTAâ€™s subways and trains. Arts & Design works closely with the architects and engineers at MTA NYC Transit, Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad to determine the parameters and sites for the artwork that is to be incorporated into each station scheduled for renovation. A diversity of well-established, mid-career and emerging artists contribute to the growing collection of works created in the materials of the system -mosaic, ceramic, tile, bronze, steel and glass. Artists are chosen through a competitive process that uses selection panels comprised of visual arts professionals and community representatives which review and select artists. This data provides the branch or station and the artist and artwork information.

- Can you reproduce the `station_lines` dataset without looking at our Cleaning Script? How does your solution differ from ours?
- Which agency has the most art? Which has the least?
- What are some common materials? How are details such as "hand forged" for bronze denoted in the data? Can you reliably take these details into account in your counts?
