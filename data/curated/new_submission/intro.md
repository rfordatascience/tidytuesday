Today we're exploring the (lack of) connection between fatal car crashes in the United States and the ["4/20 holiday" (4:20pm to 11:59pm on April 20th)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/420_(cannabis_culture)).
Thank you to @Rmadillo for [submitting this dataset *6 years ago!*](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues/58), including [a bonus script to generate sample plots!](https://github.com/Rmadillo/Harper_and_Palayew/blob/master/Load_Data_and_Clean.R)

> [In January 2019], Harper and Palayew[1] published a study looking at whether 
> a signal could be detected in fatal car crashes in the United States based on 
> the "4/20" holiday, based on a previous study by Staples and Redelmeier[2] 
> that suggested a strong link. Using more robust methods and a more 
> comprehensive time window, Harper and Palayew could not find a signal for 
> 4/20, but could for other holidays, such as July 4.

> This is a great example of how charts can mislead based on choices in analysis
> and plotting.

Questions:

- Can you detect any correlations between fatal car crashes and particular days of the year?
- What are the most dangerous days of the year for fatal car crashes in the United States?
- What other factors might help analyze the data in more detail? You can use the cleaning script to download the full dataset.
