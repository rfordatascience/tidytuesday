This week we're exploring Web APIs! 
The lead volunteer for TidyTuesday (Jon Harmon) is writing a book about working with [Web APIs with R](https://dslc.io/wapir) as well as [a series of R packages to make it easier to create API-wrapping R packages](https://beekeeper.api2r.org/).
On Thursday, 2025-06-19, Jon will present a talk on this package ecosystem at the [Ghana R Conference 2025](https://ghana-rusers.org/ghana-r-conference-2025/).
While working on the packages and the talk, Jon explored a list of APIs from the website [APIs.guru](https://apis.guru).
That dataset is provided here.

> [APIs.guru's] goal is to create a machine-readable Wikipedia for Web APIs in the OpenAPI Specification format.

- What API specs are provided by APIs.guru? Are these the same as the origin specs?
- How many different APIs ("services") do providers provide?
- What licenses do APIs use?
- Are any APIs listed more than once in the dataset?
