This week we're exploring the water quality of Sydney's iconic beaches. The data is 
available at the New South Wales State Government [Beachwatch 
website](https://www.beachwatch.nsw.gov.au/waterMonitoring/waterQualityData). 

> Beachwatch and our partners monitor water quality at swim sites to ensure 
> that recreational water environments are managed as safely as possible so that 
> as many people as possible can benefit from using the water.

[Sydney beaches were in the news](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-10/pollution-risks-in-sydney-beaches-contaminated-waterways-rain/104790856.) 
this summer with high rainfall causing concerns about the safety of the water.

The dataset this week includes both water quality and [historical weather data](https://open-meteo.com/) from 1991 until 2025. 

- Has the water quality declined over this period?
- How does rainfall impact E-coli bacteria levels? 
- Are some swimming sites particularly prone to high bacteria levels following rain?
