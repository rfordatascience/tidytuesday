This week we are exploring measles and rubella cases across the world. This data was downloaded from 
the World Health Organisation [Provisional monthly measles and rubella data](https://immunizationdata.who.int/global?topic=Provisional-measles-and-rubella-data&location=) on 
2025-06-12. 

> Please note that all data contained within is provisional. The number of cases of measles and 
> rubella officially reported by a WHO Member State is only available by July of each year 
> (through the joint WHO UNICEF annual data collection exercise). If any numbers from this provisional
> data are quoted, they should be properly sourced with a date (i.e. "provisional data based on 
> monthly data reported to WHO (Geneva) as of June 2025"). For official data from 1980, please visit our website:

- How have global measles cases changed over time?
- Which regions or countries consistently report the highest measles burden?
- Are there seasonal patterns in measles outbreaks across different regions?
- Does the ratio of laboratory-confirmed cases to total cases reveal differences in healthcare capacity across countries?
