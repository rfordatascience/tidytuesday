This week we are exploring data from the [`{roundabouts}` package](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/roundabouts) by Emil Hvitfeldt. 
The roundabouts package provides an R friendly way to access the roundabouts database which is compiled by [Kittelson & Associates](https://roundabouts.kittelson.com/) 
and contains information about the location, configuration, and construction of roundabout intersections around the world. 

> “It started with an inventory of U.S. roundabouts that identified 150 sites,” Lee says. “One thing led to another, and now we’re at 
over 20,000 records in the database.”

- How has roundabout construction evolved over time? Are certain regions adopting them faster than others?
- What types of intersections are most commonly converted to roundabouts?
- Where are the roundabouts with the most unusual configurations (highest number of approaches/driveways)?
