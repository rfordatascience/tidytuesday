The dataset this week explores seismic events detected at the famous Mount Vesuvius in Italy. It comes from the [Italian Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV)](https://www.ingv.it/)'s [Data Portal](https://data.ingv.it/en/) and can be explored
along with other seismic areas on [the GOSSIP website](https://terremoti.ov.ingv.it/gossip/vesuvio/index.html). The raw data was saved as individual CSV files from the GOSSIP website and some values were translated from Italian to English.   


> The Open Data Portal of Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) gives public access to data resulting from institutional research activities in the fields of Seismology, Volcanology, and Environment.  

Some information about Mount Vesuvius [from INGV](https://www.ingv.it/somma-vesuvio):  
> Location: Campania, 40°49′18.01″N, 14°25'33.57” E
> Maximum height: 1281 m above sea level
> Total surface area: ≈115-150 km2
> Type of volcano: stratovolcano
> Start of eruptive activity: <39,000 years
> Last eruption: 1944 (lasted about 10 days)
> Activity status: quiescent (not active, but is still registering seismic activity)

- How has the number and severity of seismic events changed over the last decade?
- Is there a correlation between earthquake depth and magnitude at Vesuvius?
- Do seismic events at Vesuvius follow any seasonal patterns or time-of-day patterns?
- Has the average location of seismic events migrated at all over the course of the data collection period?
