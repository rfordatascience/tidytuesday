This week we're exploring Pixar films! The data this week comes from the {pixarfilms} R package by [Eric Leung](https://github.com/erictleung). 

> R data package to explore Pixar films, the people, and reception data. This package contains six data sets provided mostly in part by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pixar_films).

- Why are some values missing in the datasets?
- Which films have the highest score in each rating system? Are there distinct differences in ratings?
- Download the [`box_office` dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictleung/pixarfilms/master/data-raw/box_office.csv) from the {pixarfilms} package. How does the `box_office_us_canada` value compare to the various ratings? Is the trend different for `box_office_worldwide`?
