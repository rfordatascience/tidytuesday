This week we're exploring Income Inequality Before and After Taxes, as processed and visualized by Joe Hasell at Our World in Data: ["Income inequality before and after taxes: how much do countries redistribute income?"](https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality-before-and-after-taxes)

All data was processed by [Our World in Data]](https://ourworldindata.org), using these sources:

> The Gini coefficient measures inequality on a scale from 0 to 1. Higher values indicate higher inequality. Inequality is measured here in terms of income before and after taxes and benefits.

- Which countries have the highest Gini coefficient before taxes?
- Which countries have the highest Gini coefficient after taxes?
- Which countries have the highest shifts in Gini coefficient?
- Which countries have the lowest shifts in Gini coefficient?
- Which countries have had the highest changes in redistribution in the available data?
