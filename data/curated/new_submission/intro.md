This week we are exploring data related to the Selected British Literary Prizes (1990-2022) dataset which comes from the [Post45 Data Collective](https://data.post45.org/posts/british-literary-prizes/). 

> "This dataset contains primary categories of information on individual authors comprising gender, sexuality, UK residency, ethnicity, geography and details of educational background, 
> including institutions where the authors acquired their degrees and their fields of study. Along with other similar projects, we aim to provide information to assess the cultural, 
> social and political factors determining literary prestige. Our goal is to contribute to greater transparency in discussions around diversity and equity in literary prize cultures." 

Additional metadata discussion relating to the ethnicity, gender and sexuality, and educational classification variables is [available here](https://data.post45.org/posts/british-literary-prizes/). 

Thank you to @gkaramanis for the [dataset suggestion](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues/893)!

In relation to ethical considerations, the authors note that...

> "All of the information in this dataset is publicly available. Information about a writer’s location, gender identity, race, ethnicity, or education from scholarly and public sources can be sensitive.
> The data provided here enables the study of broad patterns and is not intended as definitive."

- In which genres are women, Black, Asian and ethnically diverse writers most likely to be shortlisted and/or awarded?
- Have prizes improved their record on gender and/or ethnic representation in shortlists and awardees?
- Is there a connection between specific educational credentials and/or educational institutions and writers’ chances of being shortlisted or winning?
