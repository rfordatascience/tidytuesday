This week we're looking into British Library funding! 
Thank you to Andy Jackson for [compiling this data](https://anjackson.net/2024/11/27/updating-the-data-on-british-library-funding/) (and [updating it with more information](https://anjackson.net/2024/11/29/british-library-funding-breakdown-trends/)) and [posting it on BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/anjacks0n.bsky.social/post/3lbyvepb5oc22)!
Also thanks to [David Rosenthal's 2017 blog](https://blog.dshr.org/2017/08/preservation-is-not-technical-problem.html) for inspiring Andy's efforts!

It hadn't all turned around, and he had to jump through some hoops to compile the data. 
Thanks for the efforts to preserve the data, Andy!

- What is the most variable source of data? 
- What is the most consistent? 
- Does that analysis change when adjusted for inflation?

See [Andy Jackson's Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uxjiuWYZrALF2mthmiYbUPieu1dEdEwv9GB8dEAizso/edit?gid=0#gid=0) (where we got this dataset) for some sample charts.
