This week we are exploring [crane observations at Lake Hornborgasjön in Sweden](https://www.hornborga.com/naturen/transtatistik/).
For more than 30 years, cranes stopping at the Lake Hornborgasjön ('Lake Hornborga') in Västergötland, Sweden have been counted from the 
[Hornborgasjön field station](https://www.hornborga.com/naturen/tranor/) in the spring and the fall as they pass by during their yearly migration.  

> Thanks to crane counters from the Hornborgasjön field station, we know approximately how many cranes there are at Hornborgasjön during the spring. 
> When there are the most cranes depends on whether spring is early or late. It also depends on when the winds from the south are suitable for crane flight.

- Has the crane population at Lake Hornborgasjön grown over the past 30 years?
- If you wanted to see thousands of cranes, when is the best time of year to visit?
- Is it possible to predict the arrival of the cranes from weather patterns?
