This week we're exploring a dataset of grants for scientific research and education projects
from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) that have been terminated by
the Trump foundation in 2024. In an unprecedented action, the NSF has terminated
over 1,000 such starting on April 18, 2025, and terminations continue. These
data were collected by [Grant Watch](https://grant-watch.us) by crowdsourcing
from researchers and program administrators, as the administration has not released
information on what programs they are cutting.

From [New York Times article on the terminations](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/science/trump-national-science-foundation-grants.html):

> In general, the agency provides scientists with the opportunity to dispute its
> decisions about funding. But researchers were informed that the decision to
> cancel their grants was final and not subject to appeal.
>
>Scientists expressed fear about the growing disruptions to research and the
> harm it may do to both academia and the public at large.
>
>"Itâ€™s shocking to see the government do this,"" said Jon Freeman, a psychologist
>at Columbia University whose grant on studying facial perception was terminated.
>"It cedes American leadership in science and technology to China and to other
>countries. I think it is going to take at least 10 years for American
>scientific and biomedical research to recover from this."

More information, as well as similar data on grant terminations from the National
Institutes of Health (NIH), can be found at <https://grant-watch.us>

Some questions you might explore are:
- How many grants, and how much money, were terminated by State or Congressional
  District? What institutions? How can you present these on a map?
- Grants from what directorates, divisions, or programs made up most of the 
  project terminated?
- What topics or terms are most common in project titles or abstract?

More elaborate analysis could use [data on total awards](https://www.nsf.gov/about/about-nsf-by-the-numbers)
to look at the fraction of awards terminated, or [data on educational institutions](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data)
to look at what kinds of institutions are most affected.
