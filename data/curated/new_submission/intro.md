This week we're exploring the program for the [useR! 2025](https://user2025.r-project.org/) conference.
useR! 2025 will be hosted at Duke University in Durham, NC, USA from August 8-10, 2025.
The conference will feature keynote presentations from leading R developers and data scientists, technical talks and tutorials, interactive tutorials and training sessions, poster presentations, networking opportunities, and both in-person and virtual attendance options (with the virtual conference taking place on August 1, 2025).
The event hashtag is #useR2025, so when sharing your TidyTuesday creations this week, please add this hashtag as well!
