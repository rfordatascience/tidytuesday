      Hex sticker for the sherlock R package created by Emil Hvitfeldt. The 
      image depicts a silhouette of Sherlock Holmes with his typical deerstalker 
      hat and calabash pipe. The word sherlock appears in blue over the 
      silhouette, and the background is a pale green hexagon with a gray-green 
      border.
