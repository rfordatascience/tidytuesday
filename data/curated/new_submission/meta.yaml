    Map showing the traditional language families represented in Africa.
    Language families are depicted in 14 colors. Afroasiatic languages dominate 
    across the north, with a band of several families just south of that group. 
    A large section of the continent is dominated by Bantu languages. Credit to 
    Wikipedia. More details are available at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Africa#/media/File:Africa_ethnic_groups_1996.jpg
