    A dot plot of the average summer temperature in Zurich versus the burn duration of the Böög in minutes, with a line of best fit and record summers annotated. The plot shows a slight trend up and to the right, but 2003 had the highest temperature at almost 22 degrees, but one of the lowest burn times of around 6 minutes. Likewise, the longest burn time of 60 minutes corresponds to one of the lowest average summer temperatures at about 17 degrees.
