    A close-up photo of a rectangular slice of flatbread or thin pizza on a 
    white plate with red heart patterns. The flatbread is topped with fresh 
    spinach leaves, sliced tomatoes, cubes of tofu in both light and dark 
    varieties, and zucchini. A dollop of mustard-like spread is visible on the 
    crust edge. In the background, part of another plate, a napkin, and a 
    person’s arm are slightly out of focus.
