    A line plot showing the amount of funding (in € millions) Science Foundation Ireland contributed to Higher Education Authorities in Ireland from 2000 to 2025. A map of Ireland is overlayed on the plot as the background. Funding starts a little below €100m in 2000, peaks above €400m in 2020, and drops to €0 in 2025 after Science Foundation Ireland was dissolved and merged with the Irish Research Council to form Taighde Éireann - Research Ireland.
