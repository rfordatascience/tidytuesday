  alt: "A four-panel line chart showing Most Favored Nation tariff rates by HTS section from 2000 to 2024. Each panel displays all four sections as thin grey background lines for comparison, with the focal section highlighted in a bold colored line matching its panel title. Panel I (orange, top-left) shows Live Animals & Animal Products with the highest rates, starting around 11% in 2000, dropping to about 9% in 2012, and stabilizing near 9.5% through 2024. Panel II (green, top-right) shows Vegetable Products declining from 8.5% in 2000 to about 6.5% in 2012, then climbing back to 7.5% by 2024. Panel III (pink, bottom-left) shows Animal/Vegetable Fats & Oils with the lowest rates, around 6-6.5%, also dropping in 2012 to about 5.5% before increasing back near 6% in 2020. Panel IV (blue, bottom-right) shows Prepared Foodstuffs remaining relatively stable around 7.5-8% throughout the period, with a similar 2012 drop. The title reads MFN tariff rates are highest for Live Animals & Animal Products with the section name in matching orange color. All panels share a common y-axis scale showing average tariff rates as percentages between 5% and 11.5%, and x-axis marks every four years for 2000 through 2024."
