    This horizontal bar chart shows gender distribution of winners across British literary awards. Each bar displays the percentage and count of women (blue), men (green), and non-binary (yellow) winners. The Women's Prize for Fiction is 100% women by design. Other awards show varying gender representation, with women most represented in children's literature (Costa Children's Book Award at 71%) and poetry (Ted Hughes Award at 50%). Most other prizes show male majorities, ranging from slight (Costa awards around 52% men) to substantial (BSFA Award at 79% men). The data reveals significant gender imbalances across most literary prizes, with men winning the majority of awards except in women-specific and children's categories.
