    A bar chart titled U.S. agricultural exports to China, by fiscal year, 
    1999–22 (year ending September 30) illustrates the value of these exports in 
    billions of U.S. dollars. The x-axis shows fiscal years from 1999/20 to 
    2021/22F (where F indicates forecast). The y-axis ranges from 0 to 40 
    billion dollars. The chart shows a general upward trend in exports from 
    1999/20 (under $5 billion) to a peak in 2013/14 (around $26 billion). 
    Exports then fluctuated and declined. The bars for fiscal years 2018/19 and 
    2019/20 are colored yellow and are marked with the annotation U.S. exports 
    hit by Chinese retaliatory tariffs. These bars show a significant drop, with 
    the 2018/19 value falling to around $10 billion and 2019/20 to approximately 
    $17 billion. The bars for fiscal years 2020/21 and 2021/22F are colored 
    green, indicating the period after the U.S.-China sign Phase One agreement 
    (as noted by an annotation). These bars show a sharp increase, with 2020/21 
    reaching over $33 billion and the 2021/22 forecast exceeding $36 billion, 
    the highest values on the chart. Notes below the chart explain the color 
    coding for retaliatory tariffs (yellow) and the Phase One agreement (green), 
    specify that 'F' means forecast, and mention a change in the USDA's 
    definition of agricultural products in March 2021. The source is listed as 
    USDA, Economic Research Service using data from their Trade Outlook Reports 
    and the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census.
