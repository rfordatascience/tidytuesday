|gini_disposable__age_total |double    |The Gini coefficient measures inequality on a scale from 0 to 1. Higher values indicate higher inequality. Income is 'post-tax' — measured after taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received. Income has been equivalized – adjusted to account for the fact that people in the same household can share costs like rent and heating. The entire population of each country is considered, and also the income definition is the newest from the OECD since 2012. For more information on the methodology, visit the [OECD Income Distribution Database (IDD)](http://www.oecd.org/social/income-distribution-database.htm). Survey estimates for 2020 are subject to additional uncertainty and are to be treated with extra caution, as in most countries the survey fieldwork was affected by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. |
