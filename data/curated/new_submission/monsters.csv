CR 10 (XP 5,900, or 7,200 in lair; PB +4)
Traits
Amphibious. The aboleth can breathe air and water.
Eldritch Restoration. If destroyed, the aboleth gains
a new body in 5d10 days, reviving with all its Hit
Points in the Far Realm or another location chosen
by the GM.
Legendary Resistance (3/Day, or 4/Day in Lair). If
the aboleth fails a saving throw, it can choose to suc-
ceed instead.
Mucus Cloud. While underwater, the aboleth is sur-
rounded by mucus. Constitution Saving Throw: DC 14,
each creature in a 5-foot Emanation originating from
the aboleth at the end of the aboleth’s turn. Failure: The
target is cursed. Until the curse ends, the target’s skin
becomes slimy, the target can breathe air and water,
and it can’t regain Hit Points unless it is underwater.
While the cursed creature is outside a body of water,
the creature takes 6 (1d12) Acid damage at the end of
every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to its skin
before those minutes have passed.
Probing Telepathy. If a creature the aboleth can see
communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the abo-
leth learns the creature’s greatest desires.
Actions
Multiattack. The aboleth makes two Tentacle attacks
and uses either Consume Memories or Dominate Mind
if available.
Tentacle. Melee Attack Roll: +9, reach 15 ft. Hit: 12
(2d6 + 5) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large
or smaller creature, it has the Grappled condition (es-
cape DC 14) from one of four tentacles.
Consume Memories. Intelligence Saving Throw: DC 16,
one creature within 30 feet that is Charmed or Grap-
pled by the aboleth. Failure: 10 (3d6) Psychic damage.
Success: Half damage. Failure or Success: The aboleth
gains the target’s memories if the target is a Humanoid
and is reduced to 0 Hit Points by this action.
Dominate Mind (2/Day). Wisdom Saving Throw: DC
16, one creature the aboleth can see within 30 feet.
Failure: The target has the Charmed condition until
the aboleth dies or is on a different plane of existence
from the target. While Charmed, the target acts as an
ally to the aboleth and is under its control while within
60 feet of it. In addition, the aboleth and the target
can communicate telepathically with each other over
any distance.
The target repeats the save whenever it takes damage
as well as after every 24 hours it spends at least 1 mile
away from the aboleth, ending the effect on itself on
a success.
Legendary Actions
Legendary Action Uses: 3 (4 in Lair). Immediately after
another creature’s turn, the aboleth can expend a use to
take one of the following actions. The aboleth regains all
expended uses at the start of each of its turns.
Lash. The aboleth makes one Tentacle attack.
Psychic Drain. If the aboleth has at least one creature
Charmed or Grappled, it uses Consume Memories and
regains 5 (1d10) Hit Points."

tion, the rug halves the damage it takes (round down),

tle can detach itself by using 5 feet of movement.

CR 5 (XP 1,800; PB +3)
Traits
Aversion to Fire. If the golem takes Fire damage, it has
Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the
end of its next turn.
Berserk. Whenever the golem starts its turn Bloodied,
roll 1d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of
its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest
creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to
move to and attack, the golem attacks an object. Once
the golem goes berserk, it remains so until it is de-
stroyed or it is no longer Bloodied.
The golem’s creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk
golem, can try to calm it by taking an action to make a
DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check; the golem must be
able to hear its creator. If this check succeeds, the go-
lem ceases being berserk until the start of its next turn,
at which point it resumes rolling for the Berserk trait
again if it is still Bloodied.
Immutable Form. The golem can’t shape-shift.
Lightning Absorption. Whenever the golem is sub-
jected to Lightning damage, it regains a number of Hit
Points equal to the Lightning damage dealt.
Magic Resistance. The golem has Advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.
Actions
Multiattack. The golem makes two Slam attacks.
Slam. Melee Attack Roll: +7, reach 5 ft. Hit: 13 (2d8 +

Traits
Ooze Cube. The cube fills its entire space and is trans-
parent. Other creatures can enter that space, but a
creature that does so is subjected to the cube’s Engulf
and has Disadvantage on the saving throw.
Creatures inside the cube have Total Cover, and the
cube can hold one Large creature or up to four Medium
or Small creatures inside itself at a time.
As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the cube can
pull a creature or an object out of the cube by suc-
ceeding on a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check, and the
puller takes 10 (3d6) Acid damage.
Transparent. Even when the cube is in plain sight, a
creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check to notice the cube if the creature hasn’t wit-
nessed the cube move or otherwise act.
Actions
Pseudopod. Melee Attack Roll: +4, reach 5 ft. Hit: 12
(3d6 + 2) Acid damage.
Engulf. The cube moves up to its Speed without
provoking Opportunity Attacks. The cube can move
through the spaces of Large or smaller creatures if it has
room inside itself to contain them (see the Ooze Cube
trait). Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 12, each creature
whose space the cube enters for the first time during
this move. Failure: 10 (3d6) Acid damage, and the target
is engulfed. An engulfed target is suffocating, can’t cast
spells with a Verbal component, has the Restrained
condition, and takes 10 (3d6) Acid damage at the start
of each of the cube’s turns. When the cube moves,
the engulfed target moves with it. An engulfed target
can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC
12 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check,
the target escapes and enters the nearest unoccupied
space. Success: Half damage, and the target moves to
an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the cube. If there
is no unoccupied space, the target fails the save instead."

except ones that specifically target Undead. The ghost’s
game statistics are the same, except it uses the pos-
sessed target’s Speed, as well as the target’s Strength,
Dexterity, and Constitution modifiers.

Points or the ghost leaves as a Bonus Action. When the
possession ends, the ghost appears in an unoccupied
space within 5 feet of the target, and the target is im-
mune to this ghost’s Possession for 24 hours.

sion for 24 hours."

has the Incapacitated condition and ignores the Luring
Song of other harpies. If the target is more than 5 feet
from the harpy, the target moves on its turn toward the
harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5
feet of the harpy. It doesn’t avoid Opportunity Attacks;
however, before moving into damaging terrain (such

Traits
Bound. The guardian is magically bound to an amulet.
While the guardian and its amulet are on the same
plane of existence, the amulet’s wearer can telepathi-
cally call the guardian to travel to it, and the guardian
knows the distance and direction to the amulet. If the
guardian is within 60 feet of the amulet’s wearer, half of
any damage the wearer takes (round up) is transferred
to the guardian.
Regeneration. The guardian regains 10 Hit Points at the
start of each of its turns if it has at least 1 Hit Point.
Spell Storing. A spellcaster who wears the guardian’s
amulet can cause the guardian to store one spell of
level 4 or lower. To do so, the wearer must cast the
spell on the guardian while within 5 feet of it. The
spell has no effect but is stored within the guardian.
Any previously stored spell is lost when a new spell is
stored. The guardian can cast the spell stored with any
parameters set by the original caster, requiring no spell
components and using the caster’s spellcasting ability.
The stored spell is then lost.

Multiattack. The guardian makes two Fist attacks.
Fist. Melee Attack Roll: +7, reach 10 ft. Hit: 11 (2d6
+ 4) Bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) Force damage.

guardian’s amulet while the wearer is within 5 feet of
the guardian. Response: The wearer gains a +5 bonus
to AC, including against the triggering attack and pos-
sibly causing it to miss, until the start of the guardian’s
next turn."

Legendary Resistance (6/Day). If the tarrasque fails a
saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
Magic Resistance. The tarrasque has Advantage on sav-
ing throws against spells and other magical effects.
Reflective Carapace. If the tarrasque is targeted by a
Magic Missile spell or a spell that requires a ranged
attack roll, roll 1d6. On a 1–5, the tarrasque is unaf-
fected. On a 6, the tarrasque is unaffected and reflects
the spell, turning the caster into the target.
Siege Monster. The tarrasque deals double damage to
objects and structures.
Actions
Multiattack. The tarrasque makes one Bite attack
and three other attacks, using Claw or Tail in any
combination.
Bite. Melee Attack Roll: +19, reach 15 ft. Hit: 36 (4d12
+ 10) Piercing damage, and the target has the Grappled
condition (escape DC 20). Until the grapple ends, the
target has the Restrained condition and can’t teleport.
Claw. Melee Attack Roll: +19, reach 15 ft. Hit: 28 (4d8
+ 10) Slashing damage.
Tail. Melee Attack Roll: +19, reach 30 ft. Hit: 23 (3d8
+ 10) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or
smaller creature, it has the Prone condition.
Thunderous Bellow (Recharge 5–6). Constitution Sav-
ing Throw: DC 27, each creature and each object that
isn’t being worn or carried in a 150-foot Cone. Failure:
78 (12d12) Thunder damage, and the target has the
Deafened and Frightened conditions until the end of its
next turn. Success: Half damage only.
Bonus Actions
Swallow. Strength Saving Throw: DC 27, one Large or
smaller creature Grappled by the tarrasque (it can have
up to six creatures swallowed at a time). Failure: The
target is swallowed, and the Grappled condition ends.
A swallowed creature has the Blinded and Restrained
conditions and can’t teleport, it has Total Cover against
attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it
takes 56 (16d6) Acid damage at the start of each of the
tarrasque’s turns.
If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single
turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must suc-
ceed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end
of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each
of which falls in a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque
and has the Prone condition. If the tarrasque dies, any
swallowed creature no longer has the Restrained con-
dition and can escape from the corpse using 20 feet of
movement, exiting Prone.
Legendary Actions
Legendary Action Uses: 3. Immediately after another
creature’s turn, the tarrasque can expend a use to take
one of the following actions. The tarrasque regains all
expended uses at the start of each of its turns.
Onslaught. The tarrasque moves up to half its Speed,
and it makes one Claw or Tail attack.
World-Shaking Movement. The tarrasque moves up to
its Speed. At the end of this movement, the tarrasque
creates an instantaneous shock wave in a 60-foot Em-
anation originating from itself. Creatures in that area
lose Concentration and, if Medium or smaller, have the
Prone condition. The tarrasque can’t take this action
again until the start of its next turn."

water, it shape-shifts into a Tiny bat (Speed 5 ft., Fly
Speed 30 ft.) or a Medium cloud of mist (Speed 5 ft.,
Fly Speed 20 ft. [hover]), or it returns to its vampire
form. Anything it is wearing transforms with it.
While in bat form, the vampire can’t speak. Its game
statistics, other than its size and Speed, are unchanged.
While in mist form, the vampire can’t take any ac-
tions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless and
can enter an enemy’s space and stop there. If air can
pass through a space, the mist can do so, but it can’t
pass through liquid. It has Resistance to all damage, ex-
cept the damage it takes from sunlight.
Legendary Actions
Legendary Action Uses: 3 (4 in Lair). Immediately after
another creature’s turn, the vampire can expend a use to
take one of the following actions. The vampire regains all
expended uses at the start of each of its turns.
Beguile. The vampire casts Command, requiring no
spell components and using Charisma as the spellcast-
ing ability (spell save DC 17). The vampire can’t take
this action again until the start of its next turn.
Deathless Strike. The vampire moves up to half its
Speed, and it makes one Grave Strike attack."
