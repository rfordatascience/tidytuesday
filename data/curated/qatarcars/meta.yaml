    A scatterplot showing the number of seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h on the x-axis (ranging from 0 to 15 seconds) and the logged price of cars in the y-axis (ranging from $10,000 to $10,000,000 USD). The points are colored by engine type (elective, hybrid, and petrol). The plot includes an annotation pointing out the $2.2 million Lotus Evija, which is an electric hypercar, and another annotation highlighting the fact that electric cars tend to accelerate quickly.
