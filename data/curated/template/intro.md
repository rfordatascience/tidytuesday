1. Describe the dataset. See previous weeks for the general format
of the DESCRIPTION. The description is the part of the readme.md file above "The
Data"; everything else will be filled in from the other md files in this
directory + automatic scripts. We usually include brief introduction along the lines of "This week we're exploring DATASET" or "The dataset this week comes from SOURCE", then a quote starting with ">", then a few questions participants might seek to answer using the data.
