DESCRIPTION

This week we're exploring data from the [FBI Crime Data API](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/docApi)! Specifically, we’re looking at agency-level data across all 50 states in the USA. This dataset provides details on law enforcement agencies that have submitted data to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program and are displayed on the Crime Data Explorer (CDE).

> Crime data is dynamic. Offenses occur, arrests are made, and property is recovered every day. The FBI’s Crime Data Explorer, the digital front door for UCR data, is an attempt to reflect that fluidity in crime. The data presented there is updated regularly in a way that UCR publications previously could not be. Launched in 2017, the CDE’s content and features are updated and expanded continuously. CDE enables law enforcement agencies, researchers, journalists, and the public to more easily use and understand the massive amounts of UCR data using charts and graphs.

QUESTION?

- How do agency types vary? How are agencies distributed geographically within each state?

- What percentage of agencies in each state participate in NIBRS reporting?  Are there any trends in NIBRS adoption?
