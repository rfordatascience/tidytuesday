This week we're exploring Bob's Burgers dialogue! Thank you to [Steven Ponce](https://github.com/poncest) for [the data](https://github.com/poncest/bobsburgersR), and a [blog post demonstrating how to visualize the data](https://stevenponce.netlify.app/projects/standalone_visualizations/sa_2024-11-11.html)!

See the [{bobsburgersR} R Package](https://github.com/poncest/bobsburgersR) for the original transcript data, as well as additional information about each episode!

- How have dialogue metrics changed over the seasons?
- Can you find any patterns not shown in Steven Ponce's original visualization?
