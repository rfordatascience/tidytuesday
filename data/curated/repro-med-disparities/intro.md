This week we're exploring data on studies investigating racial and ethnic disparities in reproductive medicine as published in the eight highest impact peer-reviewed Ob/Gyn journals from January 1, 2010 through June 30, 2023. The data were collected as part of a review article [Racial and ethnic disparities in reproductive medicine in the United States: a narrative review of contemporary high-quality evidence](https://www-sciencedirect-com.amherst.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0002937824007750?via%3Dihub) published in the *American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology* in January 2025.  

> "There has been increasing debate around how or if race and ethnicity should be used in medical researchâ€”including the conceptualization of race as a biological entity, a social construct, or a proxy for racism. The objectives of this narrative review are to identify and synthesize reported racial and ethnic inequalities in obstetrics and gynecology (ob/gyn) and develop informed recommendations for racial and ethnic inequity research in ob/gyn."

A companion [interactive website](https://obgyn-shiny.shinyapps.io/obgyn-disp/) was published alongside the review article, and the data has also been used by college students to create [data art](https://katcorr.github.io/this-art-is-HARD/) to raise awareness about this research.   

The data provides an opportunity to critically examine how racial and ethnic disparities in reproductive medicine are framed, measured, and discussed in the academic literature. 

QUESTION?

- Explore how race and ethnicity are categorized in these articles. Which categories are most prominent? Which are missing? How do sample sizes vary across groups?
- Has the sentiment of article titles, abstracts, keywords, and/or aims statements changed over time?  
- What type of health outcomes have been studied? What disparities have been identified?
