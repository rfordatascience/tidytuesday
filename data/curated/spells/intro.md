This week we're exploring magical spells from the recently released Dungeons and Dragons Free Rules (2024 edition).

> Many characters have the ability to cast spells, which have a huge variety of effects. Some spells are mostly useful in combat, by dealing damage or imposing conditions. Other spells have utility in exploration. If youâ€™re playing a spellcaster, look for a mix of combat-effective and utilitarian spells to help deal with varied challenges.

- Which class has the most options for spells to cast on themselves, or on targets they can touch?
- Which classes have the most spells that require concentration? Which classes have spells that last without concentration?
- Are there any interesting patterns in the text descriptions of the spells?
