This week's dataset is derived from the 2024 Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey. Conducted in May 2024, the survey gathered responses from over 65,000 developers across seven key sections:

1.  Basic information
2.  Education, work, and career
3.  Tech and tech culture
4.  Stack Overflow community
5.  Artificial Intelligence  (AI)
6.  Professional Developer Series - Not part of the main survey
7.  Thoughts on Survey

The dataset provided for this analysis focuses exclusively on the single-response questions from the main survey sections. Each categorical response in the survey has been integer-coded, with corresponding labels available in the crosswalk file.

What can you see about developer demographics? How do developers engage with Stack Overflow? What do they think about AI?
