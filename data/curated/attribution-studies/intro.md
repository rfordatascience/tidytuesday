Describe the dataset. See previous weeks for the general format of the
description. The description is the part of the readme.md file above "The Data";
everything else will be filled in from the other md files in this directory +
automatic scripts. We usually include brief introduction along the lines of
"This week we're exploring DATASET" or "The dataset this week comes from
SOURCE".

This week we're exploring extreme weather attribution studies. The dataset comes
from [Carbon Brief](https://carbonbrief.org)'s article [Mapped: How climate change affects extreme weather around the world](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/attribution-studies/index.html). An in-depth exploration of the evolution of extreme weather attribution science can be found in this [Q & A article](https://carbonbrief.org/qa-the-evolving-science-of-extreme-weather-attribution/).

The data was last updated in November 2024 and single study that covers multiple events or locations are separated out into individual entries when possible.
<!-- Add a quote from the source, starting lines with a ">" character, like
this:
> Plant traits are critical to plant form and function — including growth,
> survival and reproduction — and therefore shape fundamental aspects of
> population and ecosystem dynamics as well as ecosystem services. Here, we
> present a global species-level compilation of key functional traits for palms
> (Arecaceae), a plant family with keystone importance in tropical and
> subtropical ecosystems.
-->

> Attribution studies calculate whether, and by how much, climate change affected the intensity, frequency or impact of extremes - from wildfires in the US and drought in South Africa through to record-breaking rainfall in Pakistan and typhoons in Taiwan.

<!--
Optional: Add questions that users should try to answer. For example:
- How does the sizes of the different species of palms vary across sub families?
- Which fruit colors occur most often?
-->
Some questions you might explore:

- How do attribution study publications evolve over time? What about rapid attribution studies?
- What type of extreme event is more frequently the subject of an attribution study?
- In which regions are most studies focused?
- Is there a trend in how climate change influences different types of extreme weather?
