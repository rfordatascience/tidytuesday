This week we're exploring extreme weather attribution studies. The dataset comes
from [Carbon Brief](https://carbonbrief.org)'s article [Mapped: How climate change affects extreme weather around the world](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/attribution-studies/index.html). An in-depth exploration of the evolution of extreme weather attribution science can be found in this [Q & A article](https://carbonbrief.org/qa-the-evolving-science-of-extreme-weather-attribution/).

The data was last updated in November 2024 and single studies that cover multiple events or locations are separated out into individual entries when possible.

> Attribution studies calculate whether, and by how much, climate change affected the intensity, frequency or impact of extremes - from wildfires in the US and drought in South Africa through to record-breaking rainfall in Pakistan and typhoons in Taiwan.

Some questions you might explore:

- How do attribution study publications evolve over time? What about rapid attribution studies?
- What type of extreme event is more frequently the subject of an attribution study?
- In which regions are most studies focused?
- Is there a trend in how climate change influences different types of extreme weather?
