We're in Seattle this week for [posit::conf](https://posit.co/conference/), so we're exploring [World's Fairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_fair)! 

> A world's fair, also known as a universal exhibition or an expo, is a large global exhibition designed to showcase the achievements of nations. These exhibitions vary in character and are held in different parts of the world at a specific site for a period of time, typically between three and six months.

The data was scraped from [Wikipedia's list of world expositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_expositions).

Does the length of a Fair depend on the month in which the fair begins?
How has the cost per month changed over time?
How about the cost per visitor?
