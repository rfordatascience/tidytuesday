    Image shows faceted scatterplots of pokemon dataset. \n
    The breakdown highlights a somewhat linear relationship between attack and defense for most pokemon types. \n
    For the most part, they are correlated, with defense and attack increasing together. \n
    There is less variance between the two variables when type is "dragon", "electric", or "normal". \n
    Noticeable types that break this trend are "rock" type pokemon. \n
    In addition, a few outliers such as a "bug" type with a near-zero attack and defense >200 hp. \n    
    (chart legends: x = attack; y = defense; facet = pokemon type; color = primary pokemon color)
