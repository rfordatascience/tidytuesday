# TidyTuesday Datasets

This week we're exploring our own data!
The data this week comes from our [{ttmeta}](https://r4ds.github.io/ttmeta/) package, which automatically updates with information about the TidyTuesday datasets.
The data shared here was compiled on 2024-06-18. 
If you would like, you can use the package to retrieve updated information about the last few weeks.
