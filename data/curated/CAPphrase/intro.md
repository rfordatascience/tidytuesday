In an [online quiz](https://probability.kucharski.io/), created as an independent project by Adam Kucharski, over 5,000 participants compared pairs of probability phrases (e.g. “Which conveys a higher probability: Likely or Probable?”) and assigned numerical values (0–100%) to each of 19 phrases. The resulting data can be used to analyse how people interpret common probability phrases.

* Which phrases do people most disagree on, in relation to the probability they represent?
* Which demographic background is the most optimistic?
* Does the order people are shown phrases in change their interpretation?
