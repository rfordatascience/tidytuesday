The #TidyTuesday community will be taking a break from our own data this week and asking you to engage with, promote, and support Black people in data.

You're welcome to revisit older datasets from #TidyTuesday this week, but especially on Wednesday Nov 17th, please create space and engage with the #BlackInDataViz hashtag on Twitter rather than promoting your own work.
