Alexander trades thrusts and parries... gets knocked down... gets up for more. Worf unconsciously moves his own hands and arms in response to the movements of the Alien.

271,Computer Voice,Acknowledged.,The wall monitor COMES ALIVE. Satisfied  Data moves across the room to Ogawa... Quick action. Picard running down the corridor  spraying pheromones into the air as he goes. We can hear Worf's FOOTSTEPS not far behind. Picard comes to an intersection  ducks into another corridor and sprays the pheromones down that hall... sprays some more all around the intersection itself in an attempt to confuse Worf. He runs down a third corridor... (Near the Transporter Room set.) Picard ENTERS and runs down the long hall... and stops. He's at a deadend. He turns to go back  but the FOOTSTEPS are rapidly approaching. No time. He quickly moves to the Turbolift and taps the control pad. Nothing happens. Picard works at the control pad  desperately trying to get the door open... suspense building as the footsteps are getting closer and closer... The Turbolift doors finally SLIDE OPEN. Picard is about to enter when he hears a ROAR right behind him. He whirls around to see -- standing at the far end of the hall  looking directly at him. This is the first time we get a real look at the de-evolved Klingon. His HEAD has been utterly transformed -- his RIDGES are huge and curved  bristling with sharp edges and pointed angles. The ridges extend downward  encasing his entire face. His jaw and mouth region are protected by the same hard  black chitin-like material  and a LARGE MANDIBLE is snapping open and shut. Worf is hunched over  his body bulkier  more powerful  uniform torn in places. This is a Klingon from millions of years ago -- prehistoric and terrifying. There is a heart-stopping moment as the two men stare at one another. Picard frozen with fear; Worf staring with a look of realization -- he's been fooled. Worf tilts back his head and lets out a ROAR of rage. He starts moving toward Picard... turns and enters the Turbolift... rushing toward Picard... The doors close just as Worf reaches them.

The doors are opening -- we can now see Worf's face through the crack of the doors... he's looking in... Picard struggles to stay in control. He looks up at the ceiling with intent -- stretches upward and grabs hold of the HATCH on the ceiling and begins to remove it... (NOTE: We do not see him actually remove anything.)

He moves to another set of doors  but stops when a sudden NOISE echoes somewhere nearby. He stops and cocks his head  listening closely much like an animal would. He eyes the doors with concern... levels his phaser at the doors and hits a control -- The doors open -- no one is there. Picard bends over to enter the horizontal tube when a BLAST of VENOM sprays down from above. Picard cries out  drops the phaser  which falls away  lost. Picard falls to the floor... looks up... Worf is staring down at him from beyond the grating  in the Jefferies Tube above. He ROARS ferociously. grabs his arm  which is covered with ACID BURNS from the venom.

An access hatch opens behind him -- it's Worf. The Klingon starts after him. It's a tense chase down the crawlway until -- as Picard reaches an opened panel -- it's the same acideaten panel seen in Act Two. The power cable which Barclay re-routed earlier is still visible stretching across the Tube. Picard grabs hold of it  RIPS the cable from the panel with a fritzing sound.

Worf is almost on top of him when Picard jams the end of the cable into the metal grating of the Jefferies Tube -- as the ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE JEFFERIES TUBE LIGHTS UP WITH AN ELECTRICAL FLASH.
