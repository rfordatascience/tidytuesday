Kia is the latest with an ad for the 2021 Kia Seltos, the automaker’s newest crossover offering. The Super Bowl commercial stars rookie running back Josh Jacobs from the Oakland Raiders. And it’s much more serious than the others that’ll air during the game.

The commercial has Jacobs returning to the streets of his hometown – Tulsa, Oklahoma – where he offers his younger self some much-needed advice and inspiration to overcome some serious challenges. Jacobs faced homelessness as a child, managing to climb from the streets of Tulsa to the NFL. Jacobs tells his younger self, “Josh, It’s going to be hard growing up homeless. But you got to believe in yourself,” and “Be tougher than the world around you.”

The U.S. version of the Kia Seltos debuted late last year at the Los Angeles Auto Show. The model actually debuted earlier in the year in India. The U.S. Seltos debuted with a unique front fascia and the mandatory amber side markers. Powered comes from one of two gasoline engines – a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter or a turbocharged 1.6-liter. The larger mill makes 146 horsepower (109 kilowatts) while the smaller engine produces 175 hp (130 kW).

The 2.0-liter pairs with an Intelligent Variable Transmission while the smaller engine gets the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. All-wheel drive with a center locking differential is an available option.

The 2021 Kia Seltos is rumored to go on sale early next month in the U.S. with a starting price of just under $22,000, which is what Kia said the Seltos would start at. Europeans hoping for another new crossover to possibly purchase are out of luck. The new crossover won’t hit Kia dealerships in Europe.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lMs79UXam9A/sddefault.jpg,TIMECAR,2

About Ben Callner

Ben Callner has always had a passion for filmmaking and directing, switching his major during sophomore year at Georgia Tech from Industrial Design to the closest film major they had -- Science, Technology and Culture. Ben comes from a tight-knit family, and his spot reflects that; his mom served as the script supervisor, and his father, a purchasing manager, served as craft services manager for the shoot. ""Goat 4 Sale"" took 2,000 popsicle sticks, 150 bags of Doritos, a goat named Moose and a small team of volunteers from Pogo Pictures, the film production company that took him under their wing after Callner persistently pestered the company's owner with his silly commercial ideas.

This hilariously inspirational spot, which features comedians Seth Rogen and Amy Schumer on the road campaigning for their new party, claimed the 9th spot amongst the top performing commercials on game-day with over 3.6% of the Digital Share Of Voice, a million plus organic views and over 23,000 social actions.

What basically happens is that our two comedians campaign for the Bud Light Party by stumping across America on a platform of unity over division. We as a nation have much in common, like our love of Paul Rudd and beer. Bud Light also shows off its huge, yet manageable, caucus with a motivating speech lifted straight from 1996's ""Independence Day"".

Enjoy!

Agency: DAVID&GOLIATH
Director: JAKE SCOTT
Production:RSA
Animation/VFX: METHOD STUDIOS   http://www.methodstudios.com

Method VFX supervisor Andy Boyd in New York: ""As if making a CG rhino in a spacesuit wasn't cool enough, we got to animate him screaming and praying for his life as he re-entered the atmosphere in a rocket pod. 

""Realizing the baby planet and populating it with CG animals required a concerted effort during pre-production to prep the assets ahead of the shoot. CG supervisor Brian Burke led a creature team that involved the creation of over ten different types of CG animals as well as their customized spacesuits. 

""We were able to take tools from prior jobs and make it modular in a way that allowed individual artists to use them across different characters. The work done by one artist on previous jobs could be shared across the whole team.

""For outer space, director Jake Scott wanted an ethereal look similar to the formation sequence from the film 'The Tree of Life'. Scott consulted with 'Tree of Life' VFX supervisor and Method senior creative director Dan Glass about his approach to capturing these elements in-camera. Production built two large liquid containers that were shot as a B-unit during the shoot. Method used this footage as a basis for the space environments and added detail in matte painting and compositing.

""All of the animal assets were deep into development ahead of principal photography. As plates were coming back from production, the lighting team would have first pass renders in the scenes within days. The instantaneous workflow allowed clients very early access to animation and look development as they edited the piece.

""The Babylandia planet's lush landscapes were based on conceptual renderings from Method London and derived from aerial footage shot in Kauai, Hawaii by Method VFX producer Mike Wigart. The Los Angeles team, led by artists Chris Sanchez and Zach Christian, executed matte painted backgrounds for Babylandia and Earth.

Bands and athletes shower themselves in the beer to celebrate, and it's enjoyed on the dance floor as well as at the bar -- just not with fruit, which is why the man drinking it at the bar flicks the lemon slice off his glass. It's not a hobby, not small, not soft. The Budweiser Clydesdales are not ponies, the beer is not imported and it's not backing down. Budweiser says it's not for everyone, but this Bud's for you.

Toyota is returning to the 2018 Super Bowl like never before using sports to unite and inspire during three ads in the most-watched television event of the year. The final spot to be released is from the domestic U.S., longtime campaign “Let’s Go Places,” empowering viewers to see what they’re capable of when fans unite through sports. For the first time in the company’s history, Toyota will have three primetime commercials which will be airing in the first quarter, halftime and second half.  
 
Prior to the halftime show and following the Toyota Halftime Report and a throw from NBC Sports anchor Dan Patrick, Toyota’s 60-second ad, “One Team,” features an amusing, light-hearted narrative illustrating how people from diverse backgrounds unite to celebrate the spirit of what brings them together, their shared passion of sports. 
 
“This is an unprecedented opportunity for our team at Toyota to share messages of unity, friendship, diversity and perseverance,” says Ed Laukes, group vice president, Toyota Marketing, Toyota Motor North America. “With the Super Bowl and the Olympics just days apart on NBC, we’re excited to join fans’ enthusiasm for these two world-class events and connect with them by sharing meaningful and inspiring TV spots.”
 
View the 60-second “One Team.” Previously released were Toyota’s 60-second “Good Odds” which celebrates the automaker’s evolution to a mobility company and its eight-year global sponsorship of The Olympic Games and Paralympic Games; and the 30-second spot “Mobility Anthem” highlighting Toyota’s belief that when you are free to move, anything is possible. To view, visit YouTube.com/Toyota. 
 
The “Lets Go Places” TV spot “One Team” was created by Saatchi & Saatchi and directed by veteran filmmaker Ivan Zacharias. The “Start Your Impossible” TV commercials were developed by Toyota’s agencies of record, Saatchi & Saatchi and Dentsu, with “Good Odds” directed by esteemed director Aoife McArdle and “Mobility Anthem” directed by acclaimed director John Hillcoat.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Super Bowl LIII was an American football game between the three-time defending American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los Angeles Rams to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2018 season. The Patriots defeated the Rams by the score of 13-3. The game was a rematch of Super Bowl XXXVI, in which the Patriots, led by second-year head coach Bill Belichick and back-up quarterback Tom Brady, defeated the Rams, who played in St. Louis at the time, 20–17, and won their first Super Bowl. The game was played on February 3, 2019, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. This was the third Super Bowl in Atlanta, which previously hosted Super Bowl XXVIII in 1994 and Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000 at the Georgia Dome.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nScg3KmA_6k/sddefault.jpg,Red Shirt Media,1

Beer brewing in Budweis dates back to the 13th century. A few hundred years later, two breweries were founded in the city that made beer which they called ""Budweiser,"" both being beers from the city of Budweis, which was then a part of the Kingdom of Bohemia. In 1876, the American brewer Anheuser-Busch began making a beer which it also called ""Budweiser"".
