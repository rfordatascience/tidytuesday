# Malaria Dataset

A lot of different options this week - all related to malaria data.


## Data Challenge
There is a [Data Challenge](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn16788291/wiki/583310) hosted by the Wellcome Trust and Sage Bionetworks using the [`malariaAtlas`](https://github.com/malaria-atlas-project/malariaAtlas) package of data and tools. It was supposed to be opened today (November 12th, 2018), but looks like they still may be in the pre-register phase. You can still access the package to use the mapping tools and access their dataset.

## Our World In Data
Alternatively, if you'd rather work with some simple aggregated malaria data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/malaria), you can see many different summary-level datasets related to malaria incidence by region, age, or time.
