# Datathon for the Transgender Day of Rememberance

TDoR data from Cardiff RUser Group in [package form](https://github.com/CaRdiffR/tdor) or in the [raw data](https://github.com/rlgbtq/TDoR2018). More details about the datathon challenge can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PNMa6LmjsofR8FUrnXHnwdMrvxTrBMZU2Lh8DQrsmr0/edit#slide=id.g47d8b045e7_0_127).

The Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDoR), observed annually on 20 November, memorializes those who were
killed or lost to suicide as a result of anti-transgender hatred or prejudice in the past year.

We are holding a non-competitive datathon centred on the data collected by monitoring bodies and trans
activists about relevant deaths, as collated for recent years on https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/.
This repository will be used to share ideas and potentially host code and other documents generated as
part of the datathon.

The main event will be hosted by the Cardiff R User Group on Saturday 17 November, 10:30am to 4:30pm,
where we will welcome the maintainer of tdor.translivesmatter.info as an invited participant, see
[further details on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/events/256116362/).
