## Article

"The [Baltimore Sun](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-bridge-collapse-maryland-20180815-story.html) looked at which bridges in the region are listed in “poor” condition by the Federal Highway Administration — and in particular, which have been “poor” for several years.

To be clear, “poor” condition doesn’t mean a bridge is unsafe — officials and experts emphasize that a bridge found to be structurally unsound would be closed. Still, such bridges can be a nuisance, damaging to cars, particularly tires. And the costs for repairing long-deteriorating bridges increase with every year."
