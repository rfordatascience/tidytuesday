Most of them were varmints. But every once in a while in one of them there may have lived a man.He lay face down on the desert sand clutching a six gun in his hand.Shot from behind I thought he was dead for under his heart was an once of lead.But a spark still burned so I used my knife and late that night I saved the life of Ringo.I nursed him 'til the danger passed the days went by he mended fast and then from dawn.'til setting sun he practiced with that deadly gun and hour on hour I watched in awe.No human being could match the draw of Ringo.One day we rode the mountain crest and I went east and he went west.I took to law and wore a star while he spread terror near and far with lead and blood he gained such fame all through the west they feared the name of Ringo.I knew someday I'd face the test which one of us would be the best and sure enough the word came down that he was holed up in the town.I left the posse out in the street and I went in alone to meet Ringo.They said my speed was next to none but my lightning draw had just begun whenI heard a blast that stunned my wrist.The gun went flying from my fist and I was looking down the bore of the deadly 44 of Ringo.They say that was the only time that anyone had seen him smile.He slowly lowered his gun and then he said to me We're even friend.And so at last I understood that there was still a spark of good in Ringo.I blocked the path of his retreat he turned and stepped into the street a dozen guns spit fire and lead.A moment later he lay dead.The town began to shout and cheer Nowhere was there shed a tear for Ringo.The story spread throughout the land that I had beaten Ringo's hand and it was just the years they say that made me put my guns away but on his grave they can't explain the tarnished star above the name of Ringo.,Death;Good vs. Evil,1,1,0,0,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,0,NA,0,Cannot Locate

the door with you the air was cold.But something about it felt like home somehow.And I left my scarf there at your sister's house.And you've still got it in your drawer even now.Oh your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze.We're singing in the car getting lost upstate.Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place.And I can picture it after all these days.And I know it's long gone and.That magic's not here no more.And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all.Cause there we are again on that little town street.You almost ran the red cause you were looking over at me.Wind in my hair I was there.I remember it all too well.Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red.You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed.And your mother's telling stories about you on the tee-ball team.You taught me about your past thinking your future was me.And you were tossing me the car keys fuck the patriarchy.Key chain on the ground we were always skipping town.And I was thinking on the drive down any time now.He's gonna say it's love you never called it what it was.Til we were dead and gone and buried.Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same.After three months in the grave.And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you.But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame.And I know it's long gone and.There was nothing else I could do.And I forget about you long enough.To forget why I needed to.Cause there we are again in the middle of the night.We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light.Down the stairs I was there.I remember it all too well.And there we are again when nobody had to know.You kept me like a secret but I kept you like an oath.Sacred prayer and we'd swear.To remember it all too well yeah.Well maybe we got lost in translation.Maybe I asked for too much.But maybe this thing was a masterpiece.Til you tore it all up.Running scared I was there.I remember it all too well.And you call me up again just to break me like a promise.So casually cruel in the name of being honest.I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here.Cause I remember it all all all.They say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new Hell.Every time you double-cross my mind.You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine.And that made me want to die.The idea you had of me who was she.A never-needy ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you.Not weeping in a party bathroom.Some actress asking me what happened you.That's what happened you.You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes.Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show.But then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come.And he said It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one.Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it.I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it.After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own.Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone.But you keep my old scarf from that very first week.Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me.You can't get rid of it.Cause you remember it all too well yeah.Cause there we are again when I loved you so.Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known.It was rare I was there.I remember it all too well.Wind in my hair you were there.You remember it all.Down the stairs you were there.You remember it all.It was rare I was there.I remember it all too well.And I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes.I'll get older but your lovers stay my age.From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones.I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight.And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue.Just between us did the love affair maim you too.Cause in this city's barren cold.I still remember the first fall of snow.And how it glistened as it fell.I remember it all too well.Just between us did the love affair maim you all too well.Just between us do you remember it all too well.Just between us I remember it Just between us all too well.Wind in my hair I was there I was there.Down the stairs I was there I was there.Sacred prayer I was there I was there.It was rare you remember it all too well.Wind in my hair I was there I was there.Down the stairs I was there I was there.Sacred prayer I was there I was there.It was rare you remember it.Wind in my hair I was there I was there.Down the stairs I was there I was there.Sacred prayer I was there I was there.It was rare you remember it.Wind in my hair I was there I was there.Down the stairs I was
