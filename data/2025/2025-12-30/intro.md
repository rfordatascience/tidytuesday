This week we're exploring "Christmas" novels from Project Gutenberg via the [{gutenbergr}](https://docs.ropensci.org/gutenbergr/) R package! 
We're seeking a new maintainer (or new maintainer *team*) to take over stewardship of the package, so this is a great opportunity to get familiar with the package's functionality.
If you enjoy working with text data and R, consider stepping up to help maintain this useful package!
See [the New Maintainer Wanted issue in the gutenbergr repo](https://github.com/ropensci/gutenbergr/issues/95) for details.

You might find [*Text Mining with R*](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) helpful for analyzing this data.

- Which is mentioned more often in these novels: "spirit" or "santa"?
- What is the overall sentiment of each novel?
- How does the text sentiment change over the course of each novel?
