# Extreme Weather Attribution Studies

This week we're exploring extreme weather attribution studies. The dataset comes
from [Carbon Brief](https://carbonbrief.org)'s article [Mapped: How climate change affects extreme weather around the world](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/attribution-studies/index.html). An in-depth exploration of the evolution of extreme weather attribution science can be found in this [Q & A article](https://carbonbrief.org/qa-the-evolving-science-of-extreme-weather-attribution/).

The data was last updated in November 2024 and single studies that cover multiple events or locations are separated out into individual entries when possible.

> Attribution studies calculate whether, and by how much, climate change affected the intensity, frequency or impact of extremes - from wildfires in the US and drought in South Africa through to record-breaking rainfall in Pakistan and typhoons in Taiwan.

Some questions you might explore:

- How do attribution study publications evolve over time? What about rapid attribution studies?
- What type of extreme event is more frequently the subject of an attribution study?
- In which regions are most studies focused?
- Is there a trend in how climate change influences different types of extreme weather?

Thank you to [Rajo](https://github.com/rajodm) for curating this week's dataset.

## The Data

```r
# Using R
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR R package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-08-12')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 32)

attribution_studies <- tuesdata$attribution_studies
attribution_studies_raw <- tuesdata$attribution_studies_raw

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

attribution_studies <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-08-12/attribution_studies.csv')
attribution_studies_raw <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-08-12/attribution_studies_raw.csv')
```

```python
# Using Python
# Option 1: pydytuesday python library
## pip install pydytuesday

import pydytuesday

# Download files from the week, which you can then read in locally
pydytuesday.get_date('2025-08-12')

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub and assign to an object

attribution_studies = pandas.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-08-12/attribution_studies.csv')
attribution_studies_raw = pandas.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-08-12/attribution_studies_raw.csv')
```

```julia
# Using Julia
# Option 1: TidierTuesday.jl library
## Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/TidierOrg/TidierTuesday.jl")

using TidierTuesday

# Download files from the week, which you can then read in locally
download_dataset('2025-08-12')

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub and assign to an object with TidierFiles

attribution_studies = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-08-12/attribution_studies.csv")
attribution_studies_raw = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-08-12/attribution_studies_raw.csv")

# Option 3: Read directly from Github and assign without Tidier dependencies
attribution_studies = CSV.read("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-08-12/attribution_studies.csv", DataFrame)
attribution_studies_raw = CSV.read("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-08-12/attribution_studies_raw.csv", DataFrame)
```


## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) report, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R, Python, or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
- [Submit your own dataset!](../../../pr_instructions.md)
