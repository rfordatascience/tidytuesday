This is a secondary analysis of a single-center retrospective cohort examining 8,654 postpartum women from 2012 to 2014, of whom 2,205 (25.5%) underwent cesarean delivery. Insurance was analyzed as Medicaid compared with private insurance. The primary outcome was sterilization at the time of cesarean delivery. Reason for sterilization noncompletion and Medicaid sterilization consent form validity were recorded. Secondary outcomes included postpartum visit attendance, outpatient postpartum sterilization, and subsequent pregnancy within 365 days of delivery. Of the 481 women included in this analysis, 78 of 86 (90.7%) women with private insurance and 306 of 395 (77.4%) women with Medicaid desiring sterilization obtained sterilization at the time of cesarean delivery (relative risk 0.85, 95% CI 0.78-0.94). After multivariable logistic regression, gestational age at delivery (1.02 [1.00-1.03]), adequacy of prenatal care (1.30 [1.18-1.43]), and marital status (1.09 [1.01-1.19]) were associated with achievement of sterilization at the time of cesarean delivery. Sixty-four (66.0%) women who desired but did not receive sterilization at the time of cesarean delivery did not have valid, signed Medicaid sterilization forms, and 10 (10.3%) sterilizations were not able to be completed at the time of surgery owing to adhesions. Sterilization during cesarean delivery was not associated with less frequent postpartum visit attendance for either the Medicaid or privately insured population. Rates of outpatient postpartum sterilization were similar among those with Medicaid compared with private insurance. Among patients who did not receive sterilization at the time of delivery, 15 patients (each with Medicaid) had a subsequent pregnancy within the study period. Women with Medicaid insurance received sterilization at the time of cesarean delivery less frequently than privately insured counterparts, most commonly due to the absence of a valid Medicaid sterilization consent form as well as adhesive disease. The constraints surrounding the Medicaid form serve as a significant barrier to achieving desired sterilization.","Adult; Cesarean Section; Cohort Studies; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Insurance Coverage; Medicaid; Ohio; Patient Preference; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Retrospective Studies; Sterilization, Tubal; United States",To evaluate whether women with Medicaid are less likely than their privately insured counterparts to receive a desired sterilization procedure at the time of cesarean delivery.,OH,2012,2014,Retrospective cohort,Case Western Reserve University Electronic Medical Record,Black or African American,332,White,157,Hispanic,70,Asian,6,Other,16,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent elective surgery for gynecologic malignancies between 2015 and 2019. Patient outcomes were compared by payer status using logistic regression. Sociodemographic and clinical covariates were selected a priori and included age, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification, body mass index, smoking status, malignancy site, surgery type, race, estimated income, marital status, and medical interpreter requirement. A total of 1894 patients comprised the study sample. In the multivariate model, compared to patients with private insurance, Medicaid and Medicare patients were more likely to mobilize &gt;24â€¯h after surgery (OR 1.9, pâ€¯&lt;â€¯0.05 and OR 3.2, pâ€¯&lt;â€¯0.001, respectively), to require ICU admission (OR 4.0, pâ€¯&lt;â€¯0.05 and OR 5.0, pâ€¯&lt;â€¯0.05, respectively), and to have longer lengths of stay (OR 1.8, pâ€¯&lt;â€¯0.05 and OR 2.2, pâ€¯&lt;â€¯0.001, respectively). Medicaid patients were also more likely to have higher total hospital costs (OR 1.7, pâ€¯&lt;â€¯0.05). Payer status was not associated with postoperative pain, postoperative opiate use, or 30-day readmission rates. Medicaid and Medicare payer status are associated with worse postoperative outcomes in patients with gynecologic malignancies. The poor outcomes of Medicaid patients - a cohort defined by limited income - are noteworthy. The etiology is likely multifactorial, arising from a complex interplay of factors ranging from system issues such as access to care to the unique health status of a population bearing a high burden of disease and socioeconomic adversity.","Health disparities; Medicaid; Medicare; Outcomes; Payer status; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female; Gynecologic Surgical Procedures; Healthcare Disparities; Hospital Costs; Humans; Length of Stay; Medicaid; Medicare; Middle Aged; Pain, Postoperative; Patient Readmission; Retrospective Studies; San Francisco; Treatment Outcome; United States",To compare postoperative outcomes by primary payer status for patients with gynecologic malignancies,CA,2015,2019,Retrospective cohort,UCSF Perioperative Pathway program Electronic Medical Records,White - not Hispanic or Latino,1058,"American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian",37,Asian,228,Black or African American,80,Hispanic or Latino,347,Other,83,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The objectives of this study were to determine the rate of germline and somatic testing in women with ovarian cancer and to identify disparities in testing at a comprehensive cancer center (CCC) and a safety net hospital (SNH). Patients treated for ovarian cancer from 2011 to 2016 were included. Clinicopathologic data were abstracted from the electronic medical records. Logistic regression modeling were performed to calculate odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Out of 367 women, 55.3% completed germline testing; 27.0% received somatic testing. Women at the CCC were more likely to be tested for germline (60.4% vs 38.1%, pâ€¯â‰¤â€¯0.001) and somatic (34.3% vs 2.4%, pâ€¯â‰¤â€¯0.001) mutations than those at the SNH. Patients with Medicare (aORâ€¯=â€¯0.51, 95%CI 0.28-0.94, pâ€¯=â€¯0.032) or Medicaid (aORâ€¯=â€¯0.42, 95%CI 0.18-0.99, pâ€¯=â€¯0.048) were less likely to receive germline testing than those privately insured. Patients with Medicaid were less likely to receive somatic testing (aORâ€¯=â€¯0.15, 95%CI 0.04-0.62, pâ€¯=â€¯0.009) than those privately insured. Women with disease recurrence had a higher likelihood of being tested for germline (ORâ€¯=â€¯3.64, 95%CI 1.94-6.83, Pâ€¯&lt;â€¯0.001) and somatic (ORâ€¯=â€¯7.89, 95%CI 3.41-18.23, pâ€¯&lt;â€¯0.001) mutations. There was no difference in germline or somatic testing by race/ethnicity. Disparities in both germline and somatic testing exist.

All patients with stages IIIB-IV high-grade OC undergoing PDS at our institution from 1/2001-12/2013 were identified. Patients self-identified race/ethnicity as non-Hispanic White (NHW), non-Hispanic Black (NHB), Asian (A), or Hispanic (H). Income level for the entire cohort was estimated using the census-reported income level for each patient's zip code as a proxy for SES. Main outcome measures were PDS outcome and median OS. Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine differences in OS by racial/ethnic and income category, controlling for selected clinical factors. 963 patients were identified for analysis: 855 NHW; 43 A, 34H, 28 NHB, and 3 unknown. PDS outcome was not significantly different among NHB and H as compared to NHW. Compared to NHW, Asians were more likely to have &gt;1cm residual (AOR 2.32, 95%CI 1.1-4.9, p=0.03). Median income for the entire cohort was $85,814 (range $10,926-$231,667). After adjusting for significant prognostic factors, there were no significant differences in PDS outcome between income groups (p=0.7281). Median OS was 55.1mos (95%CI 51.8-58.5) with no significant differences in OS between the income (p=0.628) or racial/ethnic (p=0.615) groups. Statistically significant socio-demographic disparities in PDS and survival outcomes were not observed among women with advanced OC treated at this HVC.

The primary objective was to evaluate the impact of age at diagnosis on racial disparities in disease presentation and outcome in EC. We evaluated women diagnosed with EC between 1991 and 2010 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results. Mutation status for TP53 or PTEN, or with the aggressive integrative, transcript-based, or somatic copy number alteration-based molecular subtype were acquired from the Cancer Genome Atlas. Logistic regression model was used to estimate the interaction between age and race on histology. Cox regression model was used to estimate the interaction between age and race on survival. 78,184 white and 8518 black patients with EC were analyzed. Median age at diagnosis was 3-years younger for black vs. white patients with serous cancer and carcinosarcoma (P&lt;0.0001). The increased presentation of non-endometrioid histology with age was larger in black vs. white patients (P&lt;0.0001). The racial disparity in survival and cancer-related mortality was more prevalent in black vs. white patients, and in younger vs. older patients (P&lt;0.0001). Mutations in TP53, PTEN and the three aggressive molecular subtypes each varied by race, age and histology. Aggressive histology and molecular features were more common in black patients and older age, with greater impact of age on poor tumor characteristics in black vs. white patients. Racial disparities in outcome were larger in younger patients.

This study evaluated the similarity of patients enrolled in NCI-supported group gynecologic cancer trials to the incident US population. Accrual to NCI-sponsored ovarian, uterine, and cervical cancer treatment trials between 2003 and 2012 were examined. Race, ethnicity, age, and insurance status were compared to the analogous US patient population estimated using adjusted SEER incidence data. There were 18,913 accruals to 156 NCI-sponsored gynecologic cancer treatment trials, ovarian (56%), uterine (32%), and cervical cancers (12%). Ovarian cancer trials included the least racial, ethnic and age diversity. Black women were notably underrepresented in ovarian trials (4% versus 11%). Hispanic patients were underrepresented in ovarian and uterine trials (4% and 5% versus 18% and 19%, respectively), but not in cervical cancer trials (14 versus 11%). Elderly patients were underrepresented in each disease area, with the greatest underrepresentation seen in ovarian cancer patients over the age of 75 (7% versus 29%). Privately insured women were overrepresented among accrued ovarian cancer patients (87% versus 76%), and the uninsured were overrepresented among women with uterine or cervical cancers. These patterns did not change over time. Several notable differences were observed between the patients accrued to NCI funded trials and the incident population. Improving representation of racial and ethnic minorities and elderly patients on cancer clinical trials continues to be a challenge and priority.","Clinical trials; Disparities; SEER; Adult; African Americans; Age Factors; Aged; Clinical Trials as Topic; Ethnic Groups; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female; Geography; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Insurance, Health; Medically Uninsured; Middle Aged; Minority Groups; National Cancer Institute (U.S.); Ovarian Neoplasms; Patient Selection; SEER Program; United States; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Uterine Neoplasms",evaluated the similarity of patients enrolled in NCI-supported group gynecologic cancer trials to the incident US population,USA,2003,2012,Retrospective cohort,"Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Clinical Data Update Service, Integrated Platform for Agents and Diseases, and Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program",White,-99,Black,-99,American Indian/Alaska Native,-99,Asian/Pacific Islander,-99,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Not Hispanic,-99,Hispanic,-99,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Using the National Cancer Database (NCDB), we analyzed time to first surgery for epithelial endometrial cancer patients who underwent surgical treatment from 2003 to 2011. Poisson regression was used to examine delays &gt;6weeks between diagnosis and surgery, controlled for patients' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Survival for women diagnosed between 2003 and 2006 with timely versus delayed surgery was compared using Cox proportional hazards regression. The study included 112,041 women diagnosed at 1108 continuously reporting NCDB hospitals. Survival through 2011 was available for 40,184 women. All patients underwent hysterectomy. Twenty-eight percent of patients underwent surgery &gt;6weeks after diagnosis. Poisson regression estimates indicated that being younger than 40years old, being black or Hispanic, having Medicaid or being uninsured, or being from the lowest education quartile were associated with a significantly higher likelihood of surgical wait time&gt;6weeks. Patients diagnosed in 2010-2011 were more likely (IRR 1.32, 95% CI 1.24-1.40) to undergo surgery &gt;6weeks after diagnosis compared to patients treated in 2003. Survival for women with surgical wait times &gt;6weeks was worse than those treated within 6weeks of diagnosis (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.09-1.20). Being a minority patient and having lower socioeconomic status or poor insurance coverage were associated with an increased likelihood of delayed surgical treatment.

We utilized the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) to identify women diagnosed with uterine grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma, carcinosarcoma, clear cell carcinoma and papillary serous carcinoma between 2003 and 2011. The effect of treatment on survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Factors predictive of outcome were compared using the Cox proportional hazards model. 43,950 women were eligible. African American and Hispanic women had higher rates of stage III and IV disease compared to white women (36.5% vs. 36% vs. 33.5%, p&lt;0.001).

Studies of sexual problems in gynecologic cancer survivors overrepresent White non-Hispanic, highly educated, and married women. Less is known about the sexual health needs of women in medically underserved populations. We therefore conducted a study to characterize sexual activity and sexual function in this population. We recruited patients attending two gynecologic oncology clinics in a large public healthcare system that primarily serves uninsured and low-income patients. Participants were invited to complete a one-time survey to assess sexual function, sexual communication, sexual distress, relationship adjustment, depression, anxiety, prior help-seeking and help-seeking preferences, and reasons for sexual inactivity. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate models to predict sexual activity status and sexual dysfunction. Among 243 participants, the majority (n=160, 65.8%) were not sexually active in the past 4weeks, most often due to lack of a partner or lack of desire for sex. Just over one-fourth of sexually active participants were identified as likely cases of sexual dysfunction. Greater endorsement of depressive symptoms predicted both sexual inactivity and sexual dysfunction in multivariate analyses. Prior help-seeking for sexual problems was uncommon; however, a significant minority of participants expressed interest in receiving care for sexual problems. Gynecologic cancer survivors in our medically underserved population have high rates of sexual inactivity and sexual dysfunction. Future research should identify feasible strategies to address barriers to sexual healthcare in low-resource settings.","Depression; Gynecologic cancer; Sexual activity; Sexual dysfunction; Underserved; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Medicaid; Medically Underserved Area; Medically Uninsured; Middle Aged; Poverty; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Texas; United States",To estimate the prevalence of sexual inactivity and clinically significant sexual dysfunction in this population and to identify clinical and psychosocial prediictors of sexual inactivity and sexual dysfunction,TX,2012,2014,Cross-sectional,Gynecologic oncology clinics at Lyndon Baines Johnson Hospital (lbj) and Smith Clinic,White,133,American Indian or Alaska Native,2,Asian,4,Black or African American,54,Native Hawaiian or other pacific islander,1,More than one race,10,item missed or skipped,39,NA,NA,Not Hispanic or latino,86,hispanic or latino,147,Item missed or skipped,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yet, AA women are more likely to die from EC. Proposed etiologies for this racial disparity, such as socioeconomic status, aggressive, non-endometrioid tumor histology, and comorbid conditions, do not account for the entire disparity experienced by AA women, suggesting an unexplored genetic component. Germline mutations in PTEN cause Cowden syndrome (CS), which increases lifetime risk of endometrial cancer. In addition, somatic PTEN silencing is one of the most common initiating events in sporadic EC. Therefore, we hypothesized that specific PTEN haplotypes in the AA population may directly predispose AA women to unfavorable tumor characteristics when diagnosed with EC. We conducted a case-control association study of germline variations in and around the PTEN/10q region between 53 EA and 51 AA EC cases and ethnic controls. Eighteen tag SNPs with minor allele frequency â‰¥0.1, were genotyped and used to reconstruct haplotypes. Forty-eight ancestry informative markers were genotyped control for population stratification. Two haplotypes were overrepresented in AA, and there was a trend towards tumors with higher stage and grade in patients with these haplotypes. One haplotype was overrepresented in the EA population with a trend towards more endometrioid tumors. We show that specific PTEN/10q haplotypes are significantly different between EA and AA individuals (pâ‰¤0.02), and specific haplotypes may increase the risk of unfavorable tumor phenotypes in AA women diagnosed with EC.","Disparity; Endometrial cancer; Haplotypes; PTEN; Adult; African Americans; Alleles; Case-Control Studies; Endometrial Neoplasms; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Haplotypes; Humans; Middle Aged; PTEN Phosphohydrolase; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",To determine if specific PTEN haplotypes in the African-American population may directly predispose AA women to unfavorable tumor chraacteristics when diagnosed with EC,OH,-99,-99,Case-control,"Gynecologic pathology, Coriell Institute for Medical Research, and the Genomic Medicine Biorepository",African American,149,European American,223,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Prospective study of women with primary or recurrent cancer of the uterus or cervix treated at a GOG institution from July 2010 to January 2012. Logistic regression examined probability of availability, eligibility and enrollment in a GOG trial. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for significant (p&lt;0.05) results reported. Sixty institutions, 781 patients, and 150 physicians participated, 300/780 (38%) had a trial available, 290/300 had known participation status. Of these, 150 women enrolled (59.5%), 102 eligible did not enroll (35%), 38 (13%) were ineligible. Ethnicity and specialty of physician, practice type, data management availability, and patient age were significantly associated with trial availability. Patients with &gt;4 comorbidities (OR 4.5; CI 1.7-11.8) had higher odds of trial ineligibility. Non-White patients (OR 7.9; CI 1.3-46.2) and patients of Black physicians had greater odds of enrolling (OR 56.5; CI 1.1-999.9) in a therapeutic trial. Significant patient therapeutic trial enrollment factors: belief trial may help (OR 76.9; CI 4.9-&gt;1000), concern about care if not on trial (OR12.1; CI 2.1-71.4), pressure to enroll (OR .27; CI 0.12-.64), caregiving without pay (OR 0.13; CI .02-.84). Significant physician beliefs were: patients would not do well on standard therapy (OR 3.6; CI 1.6-8.4), and trial would not be time consuming (OR 3.3; CI 1.3-8.1).

This was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of enhanced information and values clarification regarding prenatal genetic testing in the absence of financial barriers to testing. Women in the third trimester of pregnancy were asked whether they had discussed prenatal genetic testing with their health care providers, whether they understood this testing was optional, and whether they had undergone testing during their pregnancy. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to determine independent predictors of these outcomes. Data were available from 710 study participants. Discussions about screening tests were reported by 654 participants (92%); only 412 (58%) reported discussing diagnostic testing. That screening and diagnostic testing were optional was evident to approximately two thirds of women (n=470 and 455, respectively). Recall of actual tests undergone was correct for 626 (88%) for screening and for 700 (99%) for diagnostic testing. Racial, ethnic and socioeconomic variation existed in the understanding of whether screening and diagnostic tests were optional and in the correct recall of whether screening had been undertaken in the current pregnancy. In the usual care group, women receiving care in low-income settings were less likely to recall being offered diagnostic testing (adjusted odds ratio 0.23 [0.14-0.39]). Disparities exist in women's recall of prenatal genetic testing discussions and their understanding of their own experience. Interventions that explain testing options to women and help clarify their preferences may help to eliminate these differences.","Adult; African Americans; Communication; Decision Making; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genetic Testing; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Mental Recall; Patient Participation; Poverty Areas; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Prenatal Diagnosis; Social Class; United States","To investigate women's understanding of prenatal testing options and of their own experience with screening, diagnostic genetic testing, or both",CA,2010,2012,Retrospective cohort,Secondary analysis,African American or Black,112,Caucasian or White,182,Latina (english-speaking),72,Latina (spanish speaking),250,"Other (Asian, pacific islander, native american, mixed or other)",94,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

We analyzed data from 9 years of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. The study asked participants reporting at least monthly UI about seeking treatment for their UI at baseline and in visit years 7, 8, and 9. Our main covariates included self-reported race or ethnicity, income, level of difficulty paying for basics, and education level. We used multiple logistic regression to examine associations between demographic, psychosocial, and longitudinal UI characteristics and whether women sought UI treatment. We explored interactions by race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status measures, and education level. A total of 1,550 women (68% of women with UI) reported seeking treatment for UI over the 9 years of this study. In multivariable analyses, women had higher odds of seeking treatment when UI in the year before seeking treatment was more frequent (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-8.67) and more bothersome (adjusted OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.18), with longer symptom duration, and with worsening UI symptoms (adjusted OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.01-3.04). Women who saw physicians regularly, had more preventive women's health visits, or both were more likely to seek UI treatment (adjusted OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.07, 1.30). Race or ethnicity, socioeconomic measures, and education were not significantly related to seeking treatment for UI. We found no evidence of racial or ethnic, socioeconomic, or education level disparities in UI treatment-seeking.

We hypothesized that a comprehensive classification systemÂ appropriately could group women with similar STPB causes and could provide an explanation, at least in part, for the disparities inÂ SPTB that are associated with race and gestational age at delivery. This was a planned analysis of a multicenter, prospective study of singleton SPTBs. Women with SPTB at &lt;34 weeks' gestation were included. We defined 9 potential SPTB phenotypes based on clinical data: infection/inflammation, maternal stress, decidual hemorrhage, uterine distention, cervical insufficiency, placental dysfunction, premature rupture of the membranes, maternal comorbidities, and familial factors. Each woman's condition was evaluated for each phenotype. Delivery gestational age was compared between those with and without each phenotype. Phenotype profiles were also compared between women with very early (20.0-27.9 weeks' gestation) SPTB vs those with early SPTB (28.0-34.0 weeks' gestation) and between African American and white women. Statistical analysis was by tÂ test and Ï‡(2) test, as appropriate. The phenotyping tool was applied to 1025 women with SPTBs who delivered at a mean 30.0 Â± 3.2 (SD) weeks' gestation.

Of the 52,260 women, 3932 (7.5%) were coded as Asian, and 48,328 (92.5%) were White. The median age of Asians at diagnosis was 56 vs. 64 years for the Whites (p&lt;0.001). Asians were more likely to undergo primary surgery, have an earlier stage of disease, have a diagnosis of a non-serous histology, and have lower grade tumors.

We used public-use data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. The study included 69,764 non-Hispanic White and Hispanic women diagnosed with endometrial cancer between 2000 and 2010. Using Cox proportional hazards models, demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatment were assessed as potential explanatory variables for the survival disparity between non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics. Kaplan-Meier estimation with Bonferroni correction showed statistically different cancer-specific survival for U.S.-born and foreign-born Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic Whites, but no difference between birthplace-unknown Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites. In 2000-2005, U.S.-born and foreign-born Hispanics had a higher risk of endometrial cancer death compared to non-Hispanic Whites after full adjustment (hazard rate (HR)=1.61, 95% Confidence Interval (CI):1.44-1.79 and 1.27, 95% CI:1.13-1.43). In 2006-2010, the risk of endometrial death was not statistically significant for U.S.-born Hispanics (HR=1.16, 95% CI:0.99-1.36), but increased for foreign-born Hispanics (HR=1.31, 95% CI:1.12-1.52). Most of the survival disparity between Hispanic and non-Hispanic White women was mediated by cancer characteristics, specifically, stage and node involvement. Hispanic women have higher cancer-specific mortality compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Compared to 2000-2005, more Hispanics were diagnosed at later stages and fewer received combination therapy in 2006-2010. Early detection is vital to improving endometrial cancer survival as most of the disparity was mediated by stage. Increased efforts are needed to improve education and access to care for Hispanic women.","Endometrial cancer; Hispanics; Non-Hispanic Whites; SEER; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Endometrial Neoplasms; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Status Disparities; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; SEER Program; Treatment Outcome; United States","To compare demographics, tumor characteristics, the first course of treatment, and cancer specific survival of non-Hispanic White and Hispanic women with endometrial cancer",USA,2000,2010,Retrospective cohort,"Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program",Non-Hispanic White,63216,Hispanic,69764,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,u.s.-born hispanics,1572,foreign-born hispanics,1561,hispanics with unknown birthplace,3415,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Pregnant women were sequentially included from four Wisconsin cohorts: large urban, midsize urban, small city, and rural city. Demographic, clinical, and current pregnancy data were collected. Cervical and urine specimens were analyzed by microscopy, culture, and polymerase chain reaction for potential pathogens. Six hundred seventy-six women were evaluated. Fifty-four (8.0%) had preterm birth: 12.1% (19/157) large urban, 8.8% (15/170) midsize urban, 9.4% (16/171) small city, and 2.3% (4/178) rural city. Associated host factors and infections varied significantly among sites. Urogenital infection rates, especially Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma parvum, were highest at the large urban site. Large urban site, minority ethnicity, multiple infections, and certain historical factors were associated with preterm birth by univariable analysis. By multivariable analysis, preterm birth was associated with prior preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-6.02) and urinary tract infection (aOR 2.62, 95% CI 1.32-519), and negatively associated with provider-assessed good health (aOR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23-0.76) and group B streptococcal infection treatment (surrogate for health care use) (aOR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15-.99). Risk and protective factors were similar for women with birth at less than 35 weeks, and additionally associated with M hominis (aOR 3.6, 95% CI 1.4-9.7). These measured differences among sites are consistent with observations that link epidemiologic factors, both environmental and genetic, with minimally pathogenic vaginal bacteria, inducing preterm birth, especially at less than 35 weeks of gestation.","Adolescent; Adult; Cervix Uteri; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Midwestern United States; Mycoplasma hominis; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Premature Birth; Risk Factors; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Ureaplasma",To correlate epidemiologic factors with urogenital infections associated with preterm birth,WI,2008,2011,Prospective cohort,questionnaire,White,492,Indigenous American,7,Pacific Islander,2,Black,139,Hispanic or Latino,20,multiple races,7,Asian,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The purpose is to assess the effect of neighborhood-level socioeconomic status (SES) on black-white treatment differences in a population-based analysis in a highly-segregated community. Illinois State Cancer Registry data for invasive epithelial ovarian cancer cases diagnosed in Cook County, IL in non-Hispanic white (NHW) or black (NHB) women from 1998 to 2009 was analyzed. As few women receive NCCN-adherent care, variables were constructed to assess extent of treatment, including receipt of: 1) debulking surgery; 2) any surgery; 3) multi-agent chemotherapy; and 4) any chemotherapy. Two measures (concentrated affluence and disadvantage) were used to estimate neighborhood-level SES. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), with generalized linear mixed models to account for hierarchical data. 2766 (81.0%) NHW and 647 (19.0%) NHB women were diagnosed. Adjusting for covariates, NHB were less likely to receive debulking surgery (OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.30-0.50), any surgery (OR: 0.38; 95%CI: 0.29-0.49), multi-agent chemotherapy (OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.45-0.71) and any chemotherapy (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.45-0.74). Concentrated affluence but not disadvantage was significant in final models for multi-agent and any chemotherapy, but not debulking or any surgery. Results identify black-white differences consistent across treatments that persist despite adjustment for neighborhood-level SES.

Patients diagnosed with stage IIIC/IV epithelial ovarian cancer (1/1/96-12/31/06) were identified from the California Cancer Registry.

Disparities in geographic predictors of treatment adherence were analyzed with the x(2) test for equality of proportions. Of the 11,770 patients identified, 45.4% were treated according to NCCN guidelines. Black race (OR=1.49, 95%CI=1.21-1.83), low-SES (OR=1.46, 95%CI=1.24-1.72), and geographic location â‰¥80 km/50 mi from a high-volume hospital (OR=1.88, 95%CI=1.61-2.19) were independently associated with an increased risk of non-adherent care, while high-volume hospital treatment (OR=0.59, 95%CI=0.53-0.66) and travel distance to receive care â‰¥32 km/20 mi (OR=0.80, 95%CI=0.69-0.92) were independently protective.

However, the fact that these same groups are more likely to use female sterilization, a highly effective method, suggests there may be variability in disparities in contraceptive use across a woman's life course. We sought to assess the relationship between race/ethnicity and contraceptive use in a nationally representative sample and to approximate a life course perspective by examining effect modification on these disparities by women's age, parity, and history of unintended pregnancy. We conducted an analysis of the 2006 through 2010 National Survey of Family Growth to determine the association between race/ethnicity and: (1) use of any method; (2) use of a highly or moderately effective method among women using contraception; and (3) use of a highly effective method among women using contraception. We then performed analyses to assess interactions between race/ethnicity and age, parity, and history of unintended pregnancy. Our sample included 7214 females aged 15-44 years.

We examine the effect of race on post-surgical complications, length of stay, and mortality specifically in a morbidly obese population. Black and white women with endometrial cancer diagnosed from 1996 to 2012 were identified from the University Pathology Group database in Detroit, Michigan, and records were retrospectively reviewed to obtain clinicopathological, demographic, and surgical information. Analysis was limited to those with a body mass index of 40kg/m(2) or greater. Differences in the distribution of variables by race were assessed by chi-squared tests and t-tests. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed to examine factors associated with mortality. 97 white and 89 black morbidly obese women were included in this analysis. Black women were more likely to have type II tumors (33.7% versus 15.5% of white women, p-value=0.003). Hypertension was more prevalent in black women (76.4% versus 58.8%, p-value=0.009), and they had longer hospital stays after surgery despite similar rates of open vs minimally invasive procedures and lymph node dissection (mean days=5.4) compared to whites (mean days=3.5, p-value=0.036). Wound infection was the most common complication (16.5% in whites and 14.4% in blacks, p-value=0.888). Blacks were more likely to suffer other complications, but overall the proportions did not differ by race. In univariate analyses, black women had higher risk of endometrial cancer-related death (p-value=0.090). No racial differences were noted in adjusted survival analyses. A more complete investigation, incorporating socio-demographic factors, is warranted to understand the effects of morbid obesity and race on endometrial cancer.","Endometrial carcinoma; Morbid obesity; Race/ethnicity; Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell; Adult; African Americans; Carcinoma; Carcinoma, Endometrioid; Endometrial Neoplasms; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Length of Stay; Middle Aged; Obesity, Morbid; Postoperative Complications; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Surgical Wound Infection; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","To examine the effect of race on post-surgical complications, length of stay, and mortality specifically in a morbidly obese population",MI,1996,2012,Retrospective cohort,University Pathology Group Database and Metropolitan Detroit Cancer Surveillance System,White,97,Black,89,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Data on deaths resulting from anomalies were obtained from U.S. vital statistics records (1983-2004) and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2003-2007). We conducted an ecological study using Poisson and logistic regression to explore the association between state Medicaid funding for pregnancy terminations of anomalous fetuses and infant death resulting from anomalies by calendar time, race, and individual Medicaid status. Since 1983, a gap in anomaly-related infant death has developed between states without compared with those with Medicaid funding for pregnancy termination (rate ratio in 2004 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-1.24; crude risks: 146.8 compared with 121.7/100,000). Blacks were significantly more likely than whites to be on Medicaid (60.2% compared with 29.2%) and to live in a state without Medicaid funding for pregnancy termination (65.8% compared with 59.6%). The increased risk of anomaly-related death associated with lack of state Medicaid funding for pregnancy termination was most pronounced among black women on Medicaid (relative risk 1.94, 95% CI 1.52-2.36; crude risks: 245.5 compared with 129.3/100,000). States without Medicaid funding for pregnancy termination of anomalous fetuses have higher rates of infant death resulting from anomalies than those with funding, and this difference is most pronounced among black women on Medicaid. Restrictions on Medicaid funding for termination of anomalous fetuses potentially could be contributing to the black-white disparity in anomaly-related infant death.

The objective of this investigation was to determine whether gene expression among endometrial cancers is different between Blacks and Whites. Fresh frozen tumors from 25 Black patients were matched by stage, grade, and histology to endometrial cancer specimens from 25 White patients. Each case was macrodissected to produce specimens possessing a minimum of 75% cancer cellularity. A subset of 10 matched pairs was also prepared using laser microdissection (LMD) to produce specimens possessing a minimum of 95% cancer cells. Total RNA isolated from each sample was analyzed using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Data were analyzed using principal component analysis and binary class comparison analyses. Unsupervised analysis of the 50 endometrial cancers failed to identify global gene expression profiles unique to Black or White patients. In a subset analysis of 10 matched pairs from Blacks and Whites prepared using LMD and macrodissection, unsupervised analysis did not reveal a unique gene expression profile associated with race in either set, but associations were identified that relate to sample preparation technique, histology and stage. Our microarray data revealed no global gene expression differences and identified few individual gene differences between endometrial cancers from Blacks and Whites.

All patients underwent hysterectomy and oophorectomy. 80% had peritoneal cytology examination and 69% underwent lymphadenectomy. AA patients were more likely to have higher grade tumors, and higher incidence of lymphovascular space involvement (LVSI). Although the two groups were balanced with regards to surgical staging and adjuvant treatment received, the 5-year RFS and DSS were significantly lower in AA compared to NAA patients (91% vs 84%, p=0.030; 95% vs 88%, p=0.011, respectively). Overall survival was not significantly different between the two groups. On multivariate analysis, after adjusting for other prognostic factors, race (AA vs NAA) was not a significant predictor of outcome. Grade 3 tumors and the presence of LVSI were the only two independent predictors of RFS and DSS with p â‰¤ 0.001 and p â‰¤ 0.001, respectively. In this large hospital-based study, AA race was associated with a higher incidence of adverse pathological features and worse recurrence-free and disease-specific survival.

In the US, the population with cervical cancer is changing. Patients are presently significantly more likely to be pre-menopausal, Asian or Pacific Islander, and more frequently have non-squamous histology than previously. These progressive and cumulative changes could be due to the disparate impact of current population based screening and prevention strategies. Understanding the implications of these evolving population characteristics may facilitate planning targeted studies and interventions for cervical cancer prevention, screening and treatment in the future.","Adenocarcinoma; African Americans; Age Factors; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Confidence Intervals; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Incidence; Neoplasm Staging; Odds Ratio; Retrospective Studies; SEER Program; United States; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms",to describe changes in the cervical cancer population,USA,1973,2008,Retrospective cohort,"Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (seer)",white,30426,black,6107,asian/pacific islander,3070,american indian/alaskan native,440,Other,320,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Black women with PCOS had higher bone mineral density (MD, 0.1 g/cm(2); 95% CI, 0.1, 0.2 g/cm(2)), lower percent body fat on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (MD, -2.8%; 95% CI, -5.1%, -0.5%), and overall a higher quality of life. Although most of these findings disappeared when the differences with racially matched controls were compared, black women with PCOS compared with black controls had lower estradiol levels than white women with PCOS compared with white controls (MD, -12.9 pg/mL; 95% CI, -24.9, -0.8 pg/mL), higher systolic blood pressure (MD, 9.1 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.8, 17.4 mm Hg), and lower fasting glucose levels (MD, -12.0 mg/dL; 95% CI, -22.3, -1.7 mg/dL).

Prospective cohort. Eight community and academic infertility practices. Three hundred ninety-one women presenting for an infertility evaluation. Face-to-face and telephone interviews and questionnaires. Use of infertility services and odds of pregnancy. Linear and logistic regression used to assess relationship between racial and socioeconomic characteristics, use of infertility services, and infertility outcomes. After adjustment for age and demographic and fertility characteristics, college-educated couples (Î² = $5,786) and households earning $100,000-$150,000 (Î² = $6,465) and â‰¥$150,000 (Î² = $8,602) spent significantly more on infertility care than their non-college-educated, lower-income counterparts. Higher income and college-educated couples were much more likely to use more cycles of higher-intensity fertility treatment. The increased cost of infertility care was primarily explained by these differences in number and type of infertility treatment. Even after adjustment for these factors and total amount spent on fertility care, having a college degree was associated with persistently higher odds of achieving a pregnancy (OR = 1.9). Education and household income were independently associated with the amount of money spent on fertility care. This relationship was primarily explained by types and intensity of infertility treatments used. Having at least a college degree was independently associated with improved odds of pregnancy.","Adult; Cohort Studies; Female; Fertilization in Vitro; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Infertility, Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; United States","To determine the effect of income, education, and race on the use and outcomes of infertility care.",ca,-99,-99,Prospective cohort,university of california,White,113,non white,278,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Physicians from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds (black, Latino, Native American, and Asian American) are more likely than white physicians to practice in underserved areas and serve patients who are poor or minorities. Abortion patients are racially diverse. However, we know little about racial and ethnic makeup of abortion providers and the differences in physicians' interest in providing abortions. The objective of the study was to examine racial differences in participation in abortion training and intention to provide abortion in postresidency practice. This is a cross-sectional study of Ryan Program residents after completing a family-planning rotation. The Ryan Program supports obstetrics-gynecology residency programs to incorporate routine abortion care into training. Since 2003 the Ryan Residency Program has administered postrotation resident surveys, and race/ethnicity was added in 2015. We assessed correlates of intention to provide abortion, specifically comparing minorities with whites and whether training participation varied by race. We conducted a modified mediation analysis to assess the role of potential mediators in the relationship between race and intention to provide abortion. A total of 777 residents (79.0%) responded from September 2015 through August 2018. The proportions were as follows: 64.9% white, 8.5% black, 4.1% Hispanic/Latino, 18.8% Asian, and 3.8% as other. Overall, 56.9% intended to provide abortion for all indications and 82.4% for pregnancy complications. In a univariate analysis, Asian residents were significantly more likely to intend to provide abortions for all indications compared with white residents (68.4% vs 56.0%, odds ratio, 1.69, confidence interval, 1.13-2.53). This difference was not significant when controlling for religiosity and abortion attitudes. Religiosity (odds ratio, 0.60, confidence interval, 0.47-0.77) and abortion attitude (odds ratio, 3.32, confidence interval, 2.48-4.44) were significantly correlated with intention to provide abortion for nonmedical indications after residency. In a modified mediation analysis, the relationship between race and intention to provide was mediated by religiosity for black residents and abortion attitude for Asian residents. There was no difference in participation in abortion training by race/ethnicity. Racial differences in intention to provide abortion in postresidency practice are mediated by religiosity and abortion attitude. Better understanding the intricate relationships between race, religiosity, participation in training, and future practice will allow us to improve abortion training while paving the way to support a more diverse abortion provider workforce.","abortion provision; abortion training; provider race; racial diversity; resident education; Abortion, Induced; Attitude of Health Personnel; Continental Population Groups; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Pregnancy; Religion; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States",to examine racial differences in participation in abortion training and intention to provide abortion in postresidency practice.,USA,2015,2018,Cross-sectional,Ryan Program,White,480,Black,63,Latino,30,Asian,139,Other,28,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

This is a retrospective cohort study of the National Cancer Database. We identified 25,223 patients diagnosed with stage IB2 through IVA cervical cancer who received radiation therapy during their primary treatment from 2004 to 2015. A univariate analysis was used to assess covariate association with brachytherapy. A multivariable regression model was used to evaluate the effect of race and insurance status on rates of brachytherapy treatment. The Cox proportional hazards model and the multiplicative hazard model were used to evaluate overall survival. P&lt;.05 indicated a statistically significant difference for comparisons of primary and secondary outcomes. Non-Hispanic black patients received brachytherapy at a significantly lower rate than non-Hispanic white patients (odds ratio [OR] 0.93; 95% CI 0.86-0.99; P=.036); Hispanic (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.85-1.02; P=.115) and Asian (OR 1.13; 95% CI 0.99-1.29; P=.074) patients received brachytherapy at similar rates. Compared with patients with private insurance, those who were uninsured (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.65-0.79; P&lt;.001), had Medicaid (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.77-0.89; P&lt;.001) or Medicare insurance (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.78-0.92; P&lt;.001) were less likely to receive brachytherapy. Brachytherapy was not found to be a mediator of race and insurance-related disparities in overall survival. Racial and insurance disparities exist for those who receive brachytherapy, with many patients not receiving the standard of care, but overall survival was not affected.","Adult; African Americans; Aged; Brachytherapy; Continental Population Groups; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Insurance Coverage; Insurance, Health; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; United States; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms",To evaluate the effects of race and insurance status on the use of brachytherapy for treatment of cervical cancer,USA,2004,2015,Retrospective cohort,National Cancer Database,Non-Hispanic white,16025,Hispanic,2846,Non-Hispanic black,4735,Asian,1178,Other,439,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Missed clinical opportunities to recommend and to administer human papillomavirus vaccine are considered one of the most important reasons for its low uptake in adolescents; however, little is known about the frequency or characteristics of missed opportunities in the young adult (18-26 years of age) population. The objective of the study was to assess both the rates of and the factors associated with missed opportunities for human papillomavirus immunization among young adult women who attended an urban obstetrics and gynecology clinic. In this cross-sectional study, medical records were reviewed for all women 18-26 years of age who were underimmunized (&lt;3 doses) and who sought care from Feb. 1, 2013, to January 31, 2014, at an urban, hospital-based obstetrics and gynecology clinic. A missed opportunity for human papillomavirus immunization was defined as a clinic visit at which the patient was eligible to receive the vaccine and a dose was due but not administered. Multivariable logistic regression was used to test associations between sociodemographic variables and missed opportunities. There were 1670 vaccine-eligible visits by 1241 underimmunized women, with a mean of 1.3 missed opportunities/person. During the study period, 833 of the vaccine eligible women (67.1%) had at least 1 missed opportunity. Overall, the most common types of visits during which a missed opportunity occurred were postpartum visits (17%) or visits for either sexually transmitted disease screening (21%) or contraception (33%). Of the patients with a missed opportunity, 26.5% had a visit at which an injectable medication or a different vaccine was administered. Women who identified their race as black had higher adjusted odds of having a missed opportunity compared with white women (adjusted odds ratio, 1.61 [95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.41], PÂ &lt;Â .02). Women who reported a non-English- or non-Spanish-preferred language had lower adjusted odds of having a missed opportunity (adjusted odds ratio, 0.25 [95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.87], PÂ =Â .03). No other patient characteristics assessed in this study were significantly associated with having a missed opportunity. A majority of young-adult women in this study had missed opportunities for human papillomavirus immunization, and significant racial disparity was observed. The greatest frequency of missed opportunities occurred with visits for either contraception or for sexually transmitted disease screening.","cervical cancer prevention; human papillomavirus; preventative medicine; vaccination; Adolescent; Adult; African Americans; Contraception; Cross-Sectional Studies; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Gynecology; Humans; Language; Obstetrics; Outpatient Clinics, Hospital; Papillomavirus Infections; Papillomavirus Vaccines; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; United States; Vaccination; Young Adult",The objective of the study was to assess both the rates of and the factors associated with missed opportunities for human papillomavirus immunization among young adult women who attended an urban obstetrics and gynecology clinic,CT,2013,2014,Cross-sectional,Yale New Haven Hospital Women's Center,Non-Hispanic white,132,Hispanic,493,Non-Hispanic black,514,Non-Hispanic other,16,Not identified,86,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

Molecular, clinical and PFS data were acquired from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) including classification into the integrative, somatic copy number alteration and transcript-based subtypes. The prevalence and prognostic value of the aggressive molecular subtypes (copy number variant [CNV]-high, cluster 4 or mitotic) were evaluated in Black and White patients. There were 337 patients including 14% self-designated as Black, 27% with advanced stage, and 82% with endometrioid histology. The CNV-high subtype was more common in Black than White patients (61.9% vs. 23.5%, P=0.0005) and suggested worse PFS in Black patients (hazard ratio [HR]=3.4, P=0.189). The cluster 4 subtype was more prevalent in Black patients (56.8% vs. 20.9%, P&lt;0.0001) and associated with worse PFS in Black patients (HR=3.4, P=0.049). The mitotic subtype was more abundant in Black patients (64.1% vs. 33.7%, P=0.002), indicated worse PFS in Black patients (HR=4.1, P=0.044) including the endometrioid histology (HR=6.1, P=0.024) and exhibited race-associated enrichment in cell cycle signaling and pathways in cancer including PLK1 and BIRC7. All of these aggressive molecular subtypes also indicated worse PFS in White patients, with unique enrichments in mitotic signaling different from Black patients. The aggressive molecular subtypes from TCGA were more common in Black endometrial cancer patients and indicated worse PFS in both Black and White patients.

We sought to investigate adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) practice patterns and effects on survival in elderly women with endometrial cancer. Women from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) with FIGO IA grade 3 to FIGO IVA endometrial cancer diagnosed from 2004-2013 were included. Chi square analysis was used to compare the elderly (80+) and non-elderly women (18-79) and women who received RT and those that did not. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to determine predictors of receipt of oncologic surgery and adjuvant RT. Univariate and multivariate Cox survival analyses were performed to examine the effect of radiotherapy on survival. Propensity score matching and shared frailty analysis were done in the elderly cohort. We identified 48,871 women for analysis. Rates of oncologic surgery were higher in the women 80+ compared with rates of adjuvant RT (95% versus 34%). Rates of RT receipt were higher in non-elderly women (48% versus 34%, p&lt;0.001). Age over 80 was a negative predictive factor (OR 0.62, p&lt;0.001) for receipt of adjuvant RT and oncologic surgery (OR 0.81, p=0.03). Adjuvant RT was associated with a decreased risk of death in elderly (HR 0.79, p&lt;0.001) and non-elderly women (HR 0.77, p&lt;0.001). Endometrial cancer patients over age 80 have similar rates of oncologic surgery as younger women but are significantly less likely to receive adjuvant RT, and this negatively impacts their survival.","Elderly; Endometrial cancer; Radiotherapy; Survival; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Databases, Factual; Endometrial Neoplasms; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Middle Aged; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; United States; Young Adult",to investigate adjuvant radiotherapy (rt) practice patterns and effects on survival in elderly women with endometrial cancer,USA,2004,2013,Retrospective cohort,National Cancer Database,White,40693,Black,3653,Hispanic,2400,Other,1591,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The mandate, one of very few in the country, has been in effect for 5 years. This study assesses the impact that it has had on the rates of human papillomavirus uptake. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the uptake of theÂ human papillomavirus vaccine among girls seeking well-child care 5Â years after the introduction of a statewide mandate in Virginia in OctoberÂ 2008. This prospective cohort study used the Clinical Data Repository at the University of Virginia to identify girls 11-12 years old who was seen for well-child care from January to December 2014. Billing and diagnosis codes were used to establish human papillomavirus vaccine administration. Those girls who were identified through the Clinical Data Repository were then contacted by advance letter followed by a representative from the University of Virginia Center for Survey Research whoÂ invited the responsible parent or guardian to complete a 50-item telephone questionnaire. Questionnaire results were used to inform objective findings and to assess parental attitudes that were related to human papillomavirus vaccination. Findings were compared against those of Pierce etÂ al (2013), who evaluated human papillomavirus vaccination levels in a similar cohort of patients in 2008, before mandate enactment, to assess relative change attributable to vaccine mandate. Nine hundred eight girls were identified through the Clinical Data Repository; 50.9% of the girls received at least 1 dose of human papillomavirus vaccine. White race and private insurance coverage were found to be associated negatively with human papillomavirus vaccine uptake (relative risk, 0.74 and 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.85 and 0.62-0.81, respectively). Black race and public insurance coverage were found to be associated positively with vaccine uptake (relative risk, 1.35 and 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.55 and 1.22-1.58, respectively). In comparison with the previous study, there has been no change in human papillomavirus vaccine uptake or distribution of uptake after the introduction of the statewide mandate for human papillomavirus vaccination.

We evaluated national utilization trends and factors associated with receiving SOC therapy. We utilized the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to identify women with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with definitive radiation or chemoradiation therapy and stratified these patients by treatment received. We identified 15,194 patients. Only 44.3% of patients received SOC treatment and this group had significantly improved OS. High volume centers, academic centers, comprehensive community cancer centers, private insurance, and higher income, were all associated with an increased likelihood of receiving SOC, whereas Black patients were less likely to receive SOC. We found 26.8% of patients received no radiation boost, 23.8% received an EBRT boost only, and 49.5% of patients received EBRT with brachytherapy. Although an EBRT boost was advantageous over no boost at all (HR 0.720, p&lt;0.001), OS was superior in patients who received brachytherapy (HR 0.554, p&lt;0.001). Patients were more likely to receive no radiotherapy boost if they had lower incomes, Medicaid, were treated at low volume centers, or were treated at non-comprehensive community cancer centers. SOC for locally advanced cervical cancer offers superior outcomes, yet less than half of patients receive SOC and there are disparities in which patients receive SOC treatment.

We analyzed data from a cohort of women who delivered at 25 hospitals across the United States over a 3-year period. Race and ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or Asian. Associations between race and ethnicity and severe postpartum hemorrhage, peripartum infection, and severe perineal laceration at spontaneous vaginal delivery as well as between race and ethnicity and obstetric care (eg, episiotomy) relevant to the adverse outcomes were estimated by univariable analysis and multivariable logistic regression. Of 115,502 studied women, 95% were classified by one of the race and ethnicity categories. Non-Hispanic white women were significantly less likely to experience severe postpartum hemorrhage (1.6% non-Hispanic white compared with 3.0% non-Hispanic black compared with 3.1% Hispanic compared with 2.2% Asian) and peripartum infection (4.1% non-Hispanic white compared with 4.9% non-Hispanic black compared with 6.4% Hispanic compared with 6.2% Asian) than others (P&lt;.001 for both).

The design was a retrospective population-based cohort study of patients with stage IIIC-IV epithelial ovarian cancer identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database (1992-2009). Quartile of census tract median household income was used as the measure of socioeconomic status (quartiles 1-4). A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify characteristics predictive of adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for surgery and chemotherapy. Cox proportional hazards models and propensity score matching were used for survival analyses. A total of 10,296 patients were identified, and 30.2% received National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline-adherent care. Among demographic variables, black race (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-1.92) and low socioeconomic status (quartile 1, adjusted OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.14-1.52) were independently associated with nonguideline care. Stratified multivariate survival analysis using the propensity score-matched sample (n=5,124) revealed that deviation from treatment guidelines was associated with a comparable risk of disease-related death across race-ethnicity: whites (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.59, 95% CI 1.48-1.71), blacks (adjusted HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.19-2.30), Asian or Pacific Islanders (adjusted HR 1.52, 95% CI 0.99-1.92), and Hispanics (adjusted HR 1.91, 95% CI 0.98-3.72).

Micro RNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as regulators of transcript expression and their aberrant expression has been discovered in many diseases, including endometrial cancer. We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based analysis in a set of endometrial cancers to identify whether there are racial differences in miRNA expression. Tumor cells from 50 stage-I endometrioid endometrial cancer specimens from 41 white and 9 black patients were prepared by laser microdissection and miRNA extracts were analyzed using TaqMan (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) low-density arrays. Statistically significant, differentially expressed miRNAs between blacks and whites were identified using multidimensional scaling, Wilcoxon testing, and analysis of variance. There were no global differences in miRNA expression between endometrial cancers from 41 white and 9 black patients. To minimize potential bias introduced by unbalanced sample size, we performed a subset analysis with stage- and histology-matched specimens from 9 whites and 9 blacks that identified 18 differentially abundant miRNAs (&gt;2-fold at P &lt; .005). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction validated miRNA-337-3p in an independent set of endometrial cancer specimens from 23 white and 24 black women. There were no racial differences in hsa-miR-337-3p expression in normal endometrium. These data indicate that hsa-mir-337-3p is more frequently down-regulated in endometrial cancers from whites compared to blacks.

Outcomes studied included overall hospice use in the last 6 months of life and late hospice enrollment, defined as within 3 days of death. We examined variations in these two measures based on year of diagnosis and sociodemographic characteristics (age, race, marital status, rural residence, income, education) and type of Medicare received (fee-for-service vs. managed care). Among 8211 women in the cohort who died from ovarian cancer, 39.7% never received hospice care (3257/8211). Overall hospice care increased over the period of observation, from 49.7% in 2001 to 63.6% [corrected] in 2005, but the proportion of women receiving hospice care within 3 days of death did not improve. Among those who received hospice care, 11.2% (556/4954) and 26.2% (1299/4954) received such care within 3 and 7 days of death, respectively. A higher proportion of black women (46.5% vs. 38.4% among whites), women in the lowest income group (42.8% vs. 37.0% in the highest income group), and those receiving fee-for-service Medicare (41.3% vs.33.5% for women in managed care) never received hospice care. In multivariable models, factors associated with lack of hospice care included age younger than 80 years (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.15-1.40), non-white race (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.26-1.65), low income (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04-1.32) and enrollment in fee-for-service Medicare compared with managed care (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.24-1.56). More older women with ovarian cancer are receiving hospice care over time, however, a substantial proportion receive such care very near death, and sociodemographic disparities in hospice care exist. Our data also support the need to target lower-income and minority women in efforts to increase optimally timed hospice referrals in this population. Our finding that ovarian cancer patients enrolled in managed care plans were more likely to receive hospice care suggests the importance of health care system factors in the utilization of hospice services.","African Americans; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Female; Health Services for the Aged; Healthcare Disparities; Hospice Care; Humans; Logistic Models; Medicare; Minority Groups; Ovarian Neoplasms; Poverty; Referral and Consultation; Registries; Socioeconomic Factors; Time Factors; United States","examined the extent and timing of hospice referrals in ovarian cancer patients over age 65, and the factors associated with these outcomes",USA,2000,2007,Retrospective cohort,"Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries",White,7149,Black,585,Other,477,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Nested case-control study. The Perinatal Research Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA. Maternal and fetal plasma and amniotic fluid samples were collected from 105 cases (59 African American and 46 European American) and 86 controls (40 African American and 46 European American). Thirty-six biomarkers were analysed using the protein microarray approach. Differences in biomarker concentrations between cases and controls of different races in maternal, fetal and intra-amniotic compartments, and the risk of PTB. Dysregulated biomarker-induced PTB pathways associated with PTB in each race were determined using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). Racial disparity was observed in biomarker concentrations in each compartment between cases and controls: amniotic fluid, IL8 and MIP1Î± differed between case and controls in European Americans, whereas ANGPT2, Eotaxin, ICAM-1, IL-1Î², IL1RA, RANTES and TNFÎ± differed between case and controls in African Americans. In both races the FAS ligand, MCP-3 and TNFR-I differed between cases and controls. For fetal plasma, ANGPT2, Eotaxin, FGF basic, ICAM-1, IGF-I, IL10, IL-1Î², IL2, IP10â€ƒKGF, MCP-3, MIP1Î±, PDGF-BB, TGFÎ±, TGFÎ²1, TIMP1, TNFÎ±, TNFR-I, TNFR-II and VEGF differed between cases and controls in European Americans, whereas only MMP7 differed between cases and controls in African Americans. IL-8 differed between cases and controls in both races. For maternal plasma, IL1RA, MMP7 and VEGF differed between cases and controls in European Americans, whereas ANGPT2, FGF basic, IL-1Î², IL5, IL6R, KGF, MCP-3, MIP1Î±, TIMP1 and TNFÎ± differed between cases and controls in African Americans. ANG, IL8 and TNFR-I differed between cases and controls in both races. We conclude that: (1) biomarker concentrations in maternal, fetal and intra-amniotic compartments differ between cases and controls; (2) there is racial disparity in the biomarker profile in each of the compartments; (3) substantial numbers of dysregulated fetal plasma biomarkers contribute to PTB in European Americans, whereas maternal plasma biomarkers contribute to PTB in African Americans; and (4) both inflammation and haematological functions are associated with PTB in European Americans, but maternal proinflammatory changes dominate PTB in African Americans. Biomarker analyses document racial disparity and the distinct pathophysiological contributions from different compartments that can determine pregnancy outcome.","Adolescent; Adult; African Americans; Amniotic Fluid; Biomarkers; Case-Control Studies; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Fetal Blood; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; Tennessee","To document racial disparity in biomarker concentrations in maternal/fetal plasma and amniotic fluid between African Americans and European Americans with spontaneous preterm birth (PTB; cases) and normal term birth (controls), and their contribution to distinct pathophysiological pathways of PTB.",TN,2003,2006,Case-control,Centennial Women’s Hospital,European Americans,92,African American,99,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

All consecutive patients diagnosed with Stage IIIC epithelial ovarian cancer between 1/1/95 and 12/31/08 were identified and clinic-pathologic variables retrospectively collected. Differences in initial treatment paradigm, surgical and adjuvant therapy, and overall survival according to racial classification were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. A total of 405 patients (White, n=366; African-American, n=39) were identified. There were no significant differences according to racial classification in age, CA125, ASA class, histology, tumor grade, the frequency of initial surgery (90.4% vs 82.1%, p=0.06), optimal residual disease (73.0% vs 69.2%, p=0.28), no gross residual disease (51.4% vs 53.8%, p=0.49), and platinum-taxane chemotherapy (88.3% vs 87.2%, p=0.55). The median overall survival for White patients was 50.5 months (95%CI=43.2-57.9 months), compared to 47.0 (95%CI=36.2-57.8) months for African-Americans (p=0.57). On multivariate analysis, age, tumor grade 3, serum albumin &lt;3.0 g/dl, platinum-based chemotherapy, and no gross residual disease were independently associated with overall survival, while African-American race was not (HR=1.06, 95%CI=0.61-1.79). Among women undergoing initial treatment for ovarian cancer at a tertiary referral center, African-American patients were as likely as White patients to undergo cytoreductive surgery, be left with minimal post-surgical residual disease, and receive appropriate chemotherapy. With equal access to gynecologic oncology care and multidisciplinary cancer resources, the survival disparities according to race observed in population-based studies are largely mitigated.","African Americans; Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial; Ovarian Neoplasms; Referral and Consultation; Treatment Outcome",To examine disparities in delivery of care and survival according to racial classification among White and African-American women with Stage IIIC epithelial ovarian cancer undergoing initial treatment in a tertiary referral center setting,MD,1995,2008,Retrospective cohort,Johns Hopkins medical institutions,White,366,African American,39,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Kaplan-Meier (KM) and multivariate Cox proportional hazards were used to estimate 4 year survival rates and hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), respectively. Among the 39,510 evaluable patients, African Americans had a higher risk of death compared to whites (HR=1.43 95% CI 1.31-1.56) after adjusting for age, clinical and facility factors and zip code level education. After additional adjustment for treatment, the risk death decreased among African Americans (HR=1.33 95%CI 1.21-1.46) and subsequent adjustment for insurance further reduced the hazard of death (HR=1.28 95% CI 1.17-1.40).

We conducted a national poll of pregnant women using a random online sample (237) and opt-in supplement (277). In all, 42% of pregnant women reported getting the vaccine. Vaccination was positively associated with attitudinal factors including believing the vaccine is very safe or benefits the baby, and with provider recommendations. Women in racial/ethnic minority groups, women with less education, and women &lt;35 years were less likely to get the vaccine and had differing views and experiences. Despite H1N1 vaccination rates that are higher than past seasonal influenza rates, barriers like safety concerns may persist in a pandemic. Messaging from providers that encourages women to believe the vaccine is very safe and benefits their baby may be compelling. Messaging and outreach during future pandemics may require customization to increase vaccination among high-risk groups.","Adult; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Motivation; Pandemics; Physician-Patient Relations; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Pregnant Women; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; Vaccination",to examine motivators and barriers related to monovalent 2009 influenza A (H1N1) vaccination among pregnant women,USA,2009,2009,Retrospective cohort,Knowledge Network's online KnowledgePanel; Harvard Opinion Research Program,Minority,195,"White, non-Hispanic",320,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The purpose of this study was to investigate the following: (1) differences in survival status by ethnicity and neighborhood median income level; and (2) individual- and neighborhood-level factors influencing cervical cancer survival. This study was based on data from 1811 cervical cancer cases obtained through the California Cancer Surveillance Program. The dependent variable was days of survival from date of cancer diagnosis. Zip code-based neighborhood-level variables were obtained from Census 2000 data. Ethnicity was significantly associated with survival (Ï‡Â²=20.58; p&lt;0.001), with African-Americans showing the shortest survival. The 5-year survival rates of European-, African-, Latino-, and Asian-American patients for all stages combined were 85%, 75%, 85%, and 84%, respectively.

However, when ethnicity was considered, Asian-Americans who lived in high-income regions showed longer survival than their low-income community counterparts (Ï‡Â²=4.531; p&lt;0.05). The multilevel model demonstrated ethnicity, age at diagnosis, and cancer stage stratified by surgery to be significantly associated with cervical cancer survival at the individual level. At the neighborhood level, residing in neighborhoods with a high proportion of African-Americans increased the risk of death by 1%.

Self-administered questionnaires examined sexual desire, activity, satisfaction, and problems in a multiethnic cohort of women aged 40 years and older with at least one past childbirth event. Trained abstractors obtained information on parity, mode of delivery, and other parturition-related factors from archived records. Multivariable regression models examined associations with sexual function controlling for age, race or ethnicity, partner status, diabetes, and general health. Among 1,094 participants, mean (standard deviation) age was 56.3 (Â±8.7) years, 568 (43%) were racial or ethnic minorities (214 African American, 171 Asian, and 183 Latina), and 963 (88%) were multiparous. Fifty-six percent (n=601) reported low sexual desire; 53% (n=577) reported less than monthly sexual activity, and 43% (n=399) reported low overall sexual satisfaction. Greater parity was not associated with increased risk of reporting low sexual desire (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.08, confidence interval [CI] 0.96-1.21 per each birth), less than monthly sexual activity (adjusted OR 1.05, CI 0.93-1.20 per each birth), or low sexual satisfaction (adjusted OR 0.96, CI 0.85-1.09 per each birth).

Vaccination &quot;completers&quot; were defined as patients who had completed all three vaccinations within 12 months of initiating the vaccination series. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with vaccine completion.

Of the 1,413 girls and young women who initiated HPV vaccination, 469 (33.2%) completed the vaccine series. Overall, private insurances (odds ratio 1.87, 95% confidence interval 1.26-2.76) and suburban practice locations (odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.98) were associated with higher vaccine completion rates. African American race was associated with lower completion rates (odds ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.65). In multivariable analyses, the combination of younger age (11-17 years) and urban practice location was associated with very low likelihood of completing HPV vaccination (22%; P=.023). The HPV vaccine completion rate is low. When resources are limited, disparities in HPV vaccine completion should be considered when developing programs to improve vaccine utilization.

Women who were 35-49 years old were randomly selected from the membership of a large urban health plan; 80% of those determined to be eligible were enrolled and screened with ultrasound for fibroids â‰¥ 0.5 cm in diameter. African-American and white premenopausal participants who responded to at least one follow-up interview (N = 964, 85% of those eligible) constituted the study cohort. During follow-up (5822 person-years), participants self-reported any major uterine procedure (67% hysterectomies). Life-table analyses and Cox regression (with censoring for menopause) were used to estimate the risk of having a uterine procedure for women with no fibroids, small (&lt;2 cm in diameter), medium (2-3.9 cm), and large fibroids (â‰¥ 4 cm). Differences between African-American and white women, importance of a clinical diagnosis of fibroids prior to study enrollment, and the impact of submucosal fibroids on risk were investigated. There was a greater loss to follow-up for African-Americans than whites (19 versus 11%). For those with follow-up data, 64% had fibroids at baseline, 33% of whom had had a prior diagnosis. Of those with fibroids, 27% had small fibroids (&lt;2 cm in diameter), 46% had medium (largest fibroid 2-3.9 cm in diameter), and 27% had large fibroids (largest â‰¥ 4 cm in diameter). Twenty-one percent had at least one submucosal fibroid. Major uterine procedures were reported by 115 women during follow-up. The estimated risk of having a procedure in any given year of follow-up for those with fibroids compared with those without fibroids increased markedly with fibroid-size category (from 4-fold, confidence interval (CI) (1.4-11.1) for the small fibroids to 10-fold, CI (4.4-24.8) for the medium fibroids, to 27-fold, CI (11.5-65.2) for the large fibroids). This influence of fibroid size on risk did not differ between African-Americans and whites (P-value for interaction = 0.88). Once fibroid size at enrollment was accounted for, having a prior diagnosis at the time of ultrasound screening was not predictive of having a procedure. Exclusion of women with a submucosal fibroid had little influence on the results. The 8-year risk of a procedure based on lifetable analyses was 2% for women with no fibroids, 8, 23, and 47%, respectively, for women who had small, medium or large fibroids at enrollment. Given the strong association of fibroid size with subsequent risk of a procedure, these findings are unlikely to be due to chance. Despite a large sample size, the number of women having procedures during follow-up was relatively small. Thus, covariates such as BMI, which were not important in our analyses, may have associations that were too small to detect with our sample size. Another limitation is that the medical procedures were self-reported. However, we attempted to retrieve medical records when participants agreed, and 77% of the total procedures reported were verified. Our findings are likely to be generalizable to other African-American and white premenopausal women in their late 30s and 40s, but other ethnic groups have not been studied. Though further studies are needed to confirm and extend the results, our findings provide an initial estimate of disease progression that will be helpful to clinicians and their patients.",disease progression; heath disparity; hysterectomy; ultrasonography; uterine leiomyoma; Adult; Endometrial Ablation Techniques; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hysterectomy; Hysteroscopy; Leiomyoma; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Ultrasonography; Uterus,"to investigate how well a single baseline ultrasound assessment of fibroid burden (presence or absence of fibroids and size of largest, if present) can predict future probability of having a major uterine procedure",USA,1996,2004,Prospective cohort,the uterine fibroid study,White,380,African American,515,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

We used cross-sectional, population-based data on women delivering full-term (37 weeks of gestation or greater), singleton neonates in 28 states who participated in the 2010 or 2011 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for inadequate and excessive compared with adequate gain, stratified by prepregnancy BMI. Overall, 20.9%, 32.0%, and 47.2% of women gained inadequate, adequate, and excessive gestational weight, respectively. Prepregnancy BMI was strongly associated with weight gain outside recommendations. Compared with normal-weight women (prevalence 51.8%), underweight women (4.2%) had decreased odds of excessive gain (adjusted OR 0.50, CI 0.40-0.61), whereas overweight and obese class I, II, and III (23.6%, 11.7%, 5.4%, and 3.5%, respectively) women had increased odds of excessive gain (adjusted OR range 2.07, CI 1.63-2.62 to adjusted OR 2.99, CI 2.63-3.40). Underweight and obese class II and III women had increased odds of inadequate gain (adjusted OR 1.25, CI 1.01-1.55 to 1.86, CI 1.45-2.36). Most characteristics associated with weight gain adequacy were demographic such as racial or ethnic minority status and education and varied by prepregnancy BMI. Notably, one behavioral characteristic-smoking cessation-was associated with excessive gain among normal-weight and obese women. Most women gained weight outside recommendations. Understanding characteristics associated with inadequate or excessive weight gain may identify potentially at-risk women and inform much-needed interventions.","Adult; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Educational Status; Female; Guideline Adherence; Guidelines as Topic; Humans; Hypertension; Ideal Body Weight; National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, U.S., Health and Medicine Division; Obesity; Pregnancy; Prevalence; Smoking; Thinness; United States; Weight Gain; Young Adult","To estimate the prevalence of gestational weight gain adequacy according to the 2009 Institute of Medicine recommendations and examine demographic, behavioral, psychosocial and medical characteristics associated with inadequate and excessive gain, stratified by pre pregnancy body mass index (BMI) category","ak, ar, co, de, ga, hi, ma, md, me, mi, mn, ms, ne, nj, nm, ny, oh, ok, or, pa, ri, tx, ut, vt, wa, wi, wv, wy",2010,2011,Cross-sectional,Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System,White,27585,Black,5419,Hispanic,7462,Asian,2310,American Indian,355,Alaskan Native,44,Hawaiian,133,Other,1155,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Between 2003 and 2006, there were 47,390 patients with ovarian cancer registered with the National Cancer Database. Variables included demographics, insurance, Charlson comorbidity score, zip income, and facility characteristics. Multivariable log binomial regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with nonstandard care. Among the 47,390 patients, 27,045 (81%) were stage IIIC or IV. After excluding patients with missing treatment information (n=1,129 [2.38%]), 13,789 (53.21%) had received standard treatment. In multivariable analyses, uninsured and Medicaid-insured patients were less likely to receive standard treatment as compared with privately insured patients (relative risk 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-0.93 and relative risk 0.91, 95% CI 0.86-0.95, respectively). African Americans and Hispanics were also less likely to receive standard treatment (relative risk 0.87, 95% CI 0.83-0.92 and relative risk 0.89, 95% CI 0.84-0.94, respectively). Patients with a Charlson comorbidity score of 2+ were less likely to receive standard care (relative risk 0.74, 95% CI 0.68-0.80). Treatment at a community cancer hospital compared with a teaching hospital was also less likely to be associated with standard treatment (relative risk 0.83, 95% CI 0.80-0.87). In this large multi-institutional cohort, approximately 47% of patients with stage IIIC and IV ovarian cancer did not receive standard treatment.

The linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results and Medicare databases were queried to identify patients diagnosed with grade 3 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma, uterine carcinosarcoma, uterine clear cell carcinoma, and uterine serous carcinoma between 1992 and 2009. The effect of treatment modality on survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Factors predictive of outcome were compared using the Cox proportional hazards model. A total of 9,042 patients met study eligibility criteria. African Americans had definitive surgery (76.8% compared with 88.7%; P&lt;.001) less frequently. There was no difference in the rate of adjuvant treatment between the groups. In the crude models for both all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality, African American women had an increased overall and disease-specific hazard of death compared with white women. The overall hazard ratio for African American women was 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-1.7), and the disease-specific hazard ratio was 1.5 (95% CI 1.3-1.6). Over the entire study period, after adjusting for stage, age, period of diagnosis, registry region, urban compared with rural setting, marital status, treatment, surgery, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities, there was no association between race and lower disease-specific survival (hazard ratio 1.1, 95% CI 1-1.2; P=.06). African American women had lower cancer-specific and all-cause survival compared with white women.

Little is known about the use of this therapy in the Medicare population. We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database to identify 4665 women aged 66 and older with epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosed between 2005-2009, with their Medicare claims. We defined receipt of any IV/IP chemotherapy when there was claims evidence of any receipt of such treatment within 12 months of the date of diagnosis. We used descriptive statistics to examine factors associated with treatment and health services use. Among 3561 women with Stage III or IV epithelial ovarian cancer who received any chemotherapy, only 124 (3.5%) received IV/IP chemotherapy. The use of IV/IP chemotherapy did not increase over the period of the study. In this cohort, younger women, those with fewer comorbidities, whites, and those living in Census tracts with higher income were more likely to receive IV/IP chemotherapy. Among women who received any IV/IP chemotherapy, we did not find an increase in acute care services (hospitalizations, emergency department visits, or ICU stays). During the period between 2005 and 2009, few women in the Medicare population living within observed SEER areas received IV/IP chemotherapy, and the use of this therapy did not increase.

Our objective was to compare treatment and survival outcomes between Black and White women at a National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) cancer center serving a diverse racial population. An IRB approved retrospective cohort study of uterine carcinosarcoma patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2012 was performed. Survival was compared by race and stratified by stage. Median progression free and overall survival (PFS and OS) were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates and compared with the log-rank test. Multivariate survival analysis was performed with Cox proportional hazards model. 158 women were included: 93 (59%) were Black and 65 (41%) were White. 95 (60%) had early stage disease and 63 (40%) had advanced stage disease.

Since then rates have been reported among privately insured women and regional health care provider populations, ranging from 1.6-2.45%. This study assessed the rate of ectopic pregnancy among Medicaid beneficiaries (New York, California, and Illinois, 2000-03), a previously unstudied population. We identified Medicaid administrative claims records for inpatient and outpatient encounters with a principal International Classification of Diseases 9th Revision diagnosis code for ectopic pregnancy. We calculated the ectopic pregnancy rate among female beneficiaries aged 15-44 as the number of ectopic pregnancies divided by the number of total pregnancies, which included spontaneous abortions, induced abortions, ectopic pregnancies, and all births. We used Poisson regression to assess the risk of ectopic pregnancy by age and race. Four-year Medicaid ectopic pregnancy rates were 2.38% of pregnancies in New York, 2.07% in California, and 2.43% in Illinois. Risk was higher among black women compared with whites in all states (relative risk, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.28; P &lt; .0001), and among older women compared with younger women (trend for age, P &lt; .001).

Pathology records were reviewed. 984 patients were identified. Racial/ethnic distribution was 382 (39%) white, 308 (31%) black, 232 (24%) Hispanic, and 62 (6.3%) other races, mixed, or unknown. 592 (60%) patients had endometrioid histology. Blacks were much more likely than whites to have non-endometrioid histologies (p&lt;0.001), including papillary serous, carcinosarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma. Blacks and Hispanics were at least as likely as whites to receive either chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The hazard ratio for death for black versus white patients was 1.94 (p&lt;0.001) when all histological subtypes were included. The hazard ratio for Hispanics for death was 1.2 (p=0.32) compared to whites. However, when patients were divided into endometrioid and non-endometrioid histological subtypes, there was no significant difference in survival by race/ethnicity. Black patients with uterine cancer are much more likely to die and are much more likely to have non-endometrioid histologies than white patients.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 316 women in group prenatal care that was compared with 3767 women in traditional prenatal care. Women self-selected participation in group care. Risk factors for preterm birth were similar for group prenatal care vs traditional prenatal care: smoking (16.9% vs 20%; P = .17), sexually transmitted diseases (15.8% vs 13.7%; P = .29), and previous preterm birth (3.2% vs 5.4%; P = .08). Preterm delivery (&lt;37 weeks' gestation) was lower in group care than traditional care (7.9% vs 12.7%; P = .01), as was delivery at &lt;32 weeks' gestation (1.3% vs 3.1%; P = .03). Adjusted odds ratio for preterm birth for participants in group care was 0.53 (95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.81). The racial disparity in preterm birth for black women, relative to white and Hispanic women, was diminished for the women in group care. Among low-risk women, participation in group care improves the rate of preterm birth compared with traditional care, especially among black women. Randomized studies are needed to eliminate selection bias.","Adult; Cohort Studies; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Logistic Models; Odds Ratio; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Poverty; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; Prenatal Care; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; South Carolina",to evaluate the impact of group prenatal care on rates of preterm birth,SC,2009,2010,Retrospective cohort,Centering Pregnancy at Greenville Hospital System Obstetrics Center,White,1832,Black,1068,Hispanic,890,Other,293,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

An analysis of SEER data.,"Race has been postulated to be a prognostic factor in women with ovarian cancer. The reasons for racial disparities are multifactorial. Recent literature suggests that racial disparities in ovarian cancer survival emerged in the 1980s, when modern treatments such as aggressive surgical debulking and platinum-based chemotherapy first gained widespread use. We suspect that as improvements in treatment have evolved, the effects of access to treatment have amplified racial disparities in survival from ovarian cancer. SEER 9 data were analyzed, including African American and white patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer from 1973 to 2007, with 2008 as the cutoff for follow-up. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, we evaluated racial differences in survival, to determine whether this difference has increased over time. There were 44,562 white and 3190 African American women available for analysis. Overall African Americans had 1.10 times the crude hazard (95% CI 1.06-1.15) of all-cause mortality compared to whites, with a widening trend over time (p&lt;0.01). Adjusted for SEER registry, age, tumor stage, marital status and time of diagnosis, the hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality comparing African Americans to whites was 1.31 (95% CI 1.26-1.37). When the receipt of surgery was added to the model, the HR for all-cause mortality remained higher for African American women at 1.27 (95% CI 1.21-1.34). African Americans diagnosed with ovarian cancer have worse survival than whites, and this disparity has increased over time. Measured differences in treatment, such as receipt of surgery, account for part of the disparity.","African Americans; Aged; Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial; Cohort Studies; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Middle Aged; Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial; Ovarian Neoplasms; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Survival Rate; United States","to examine populationlevel changes over time in survival for african american and white women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer, while accounting for both biologic (eg. stage and grade) and treatment related prognostic factors (eg. receipt of cancer-directed surgery and chemotherapy)",USA,1973,2008,Retrospective cohort,"Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (seer) public access database",White,44562,African American,3190,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is relatively more common in black compared to white women. The aim of our study is to analyze the impact of race on survival in USC. We conducted a retrospective review in women with USC managed at two large urban medical centers. Clinical and histopathologic parameters were retrieved. Recurrence and survival data were obtained from medical records and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry. Differences in overall survival between African American and Caucasian women were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and log rank test for univariate analysis. Cox regression models for multivariate analyses were built to evaluate the relative impact of the various prognostic factors. One hundred seventy-two women with USC were included in this study, including 65 Caucasian women and 107 African American women. Both groups were similar with respect to age, stage at diagnosis, angiolymphatic invasion (p=0.79), and the depth of myometrial invasion (p=0.36). There was no statistical difference in overall survival between African American and Caucasian patients in univariate analysis (p=0.14). In multivariate analysis, stage at diagnosis, angiolymphatic invasion, and depth of myometrial invasion, but not race, were significantly associated with overall survival. In this study, African American women with USC had a similar survival to Caucasian women. This suggests that the racial differences seen in USC at a larger population level may be diminished in hospital-based studies, where women are managed in a uniform way.","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous; Endometrial Neoplasms; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Michigan; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Neoplasm Staging; Retrospective Studies; SEER Program; Survival Rate",to analyze the impact of race on survival in uterine serous carcinoma (usc),MI,1992,2009,Retrospective cohort,Karmanos Cancer Center and Henry Ford Health System computerized databases,Caucasian,65,African American,107,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The design was a retrospective cohort study of discharge data from nonfederal acute care hospitals in Maryland from 2000 to 2009. Women aged 18 and older who underwent hysterectomy for uterine cancer were included in the study population. The main outcome measure was receipt of lymphadenectomy. Secondary outcomes included receipt of minimally-invasive surgical approach, in-hospital mortality and individual surgeon and individual hospital annual uterine cancer case volume. The independent variable was race. We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios and confidence intervals for each outcome of interest. Caucasians were the reference group. Among 5470 women who underwent hysterectomy, 2727 (49.9%) underwent lymphadenectomy and 512 (9.4%) underwent surgery through a minimally-invasive approach. After adjusting for age, payer status and APR-DRG mortality risk score, African-Americans were more likely to be operated on by high-volume surgeons (adjusted OR=1.27, 95% CI: 1.09-1.49) yet were less likely to undergo minimally-invasive surgery (adjusted OR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.45-0.80). For the outcome of lymphadenectomy, there was no significant difference between Caucasians and African-Americans (OR=1.13, 95% CI: 0.98-1.30). There was no association between race and in-hospital mortality or between race and the odds of undergoing surgery at a high-volume hospital.

Details about demographic characteristics, health care access, and treatment opinions based on patient race or ethnicity. The median age of participants was 35 years; 41% were white, 28% African American, 18% Hispanic, and 7% Asian. Compared with white women, African American and Hispanic women had been attempting to conceive for 1.5 years longer. They also found it more difficult to get an appointment, to take time off from work, and to pay for treatment. Forty-nine percent of respondents were concerned about the stigma of infertility, 46% about conceiving multiples, and 40% about financial costs. Disappointing one's spouse was of greater concern to African-American women, whereas avoiding the stigmatization of infertility was of greatest concern to Asian-American women. While the demand for infertility treatment increases in the United States, attention to cultural barriers to care and cultural meanings attributed to infertility should be addressed. Enhanced cultural competencies of the health care system need to be employed if equal access is to be realized as equal utilization for women of color seeking infertility care.","Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Causality; Cross-Sectional Studies; Culture; Ethnic Groups; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Infertility, Female; Middle Aged; Midwestern United States; Reproductive Techniques, Assisted; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",To identify cultural differences in access to infertility care,IL,2004,2005,Prospective cohort,University of Illinois at Chicago Fertility Center,African American,208,Asian American,54,White,306,Hispanic or Latina,134,Other,41,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Endometrial cancer cases were adjudicated by trained physicians and pathology reports were used to determine stage and grade. Cox proportional hazards models generated hazard ratios (HR) for associations between BMI and WHR and risk of endometrial cancer. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between BMI and WHR and disease stage and grade. During a mean 7.8 (standard deviation 1.6) years of follow-up, 806 women were diagnosed with endometrial cancer.

While 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17OHP-C) is recommended for preterm birth prevention in women with a prior preterm birth, non-Hispanic black women continue to experience higher rates of recurrent preterm birth than white women receiving the same treatment. Further investigation of disparities in 17OHP-C use and adherence is warranted. We sought to evaluate whether racial and ethnic disparities exist in the use of and adherence to 17OHP-C within a population of eligible women. This was a retrospective cohort study of women with a prior spontaneous, singleton preterm birth who were eligible for 17OHP-C for preterm birth prevention and received care at a single institution from 2010 through 2014. Associations between self-identified race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic black vs women in all other racial/ethnic groups) and documented counseling about 17OHP-C, receipt of any 17OHP-C, and adherence to 17OHP-C administration were each estimated by bivariable analysis and multivariable logistic regression. Adherence to 17OHP-C was defined as not &gt;1 missed dose, initiation &lt;20 weeks' gestational age, and continuation until 37 weeks or delivery. Of 472 women who were clinically eligible for 17OHP-C, 72% (N = 296) had documented 17OHP-C counseling and 48.9% (N = 229) received 17OHP-C. There were no differences in likelihood of 17OHP-C counseling or receipt of 17OHP-C based on race/ethnicity. While overall 83% (N = 176) of women were adherent to 17OHP-C, only 70% (N = 58) of non-Hispanic black women were adherent, compared to 91% (N = 118) of all other women (P &lt; .001). Non-Hispanic black women had more missed doses (2.4 vs 0.4 doses, P &lt; .001) and later initiation of care (12.0 vs 10.2 weeks, P &lt; .001) than women in other racial/ethnic groups. After adjustment for potential confounders, non-Hispanic black women were significantly less likely to be adherent to 17OHP-C (adjusted odds ratio, 0.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.65).

Median follow-up was 46.4 (range, 6.2-137.3) months. Thirteen (6.3%) patients developed with locoregional recurrent disease and 15 (7.2%) patients developed distant metastasis. Freedom from recurrence at 5 years was 88.6% for white patients and 60.5% for black patients (p=0.0093).

The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the role of comorbid conditions as modifiers of endometrial cancer survival by race. Two hundred seventy-one black women and 356 white women who had been diagnosed with endometrial cancer from 1990-2005 were identified from a large urban integrated health center. A retrospective chart review was conducted to gather information on comorbid conditions and other known demographic and clinical predictors of survival. Black women experienced a higher hazard of death from any cause (hazard ratio [HR] 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-1.87) and from endometrial cancer (HR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.63-3.60). After adjustment for known clinical prognostic factors and comorbid conditions, the hazard of death for black women was elevated but no longer statistically significant for overall survival (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.94-1.57), and the hazard of death from endometrial cancer remained significantly increased (HR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.39-3.68).

The higher prevalence of comorbid conditions among black women does not explain fully the racial disparities that are seen in endometrial cancer survival. The association between hypertension and a lower hazard of death from endometrial cancer is intriguing, and further investigation into the underlying mechanism is needed.","comorbid condition; disease-specific survival; endometrial cancer; hypertension; racial disparity; Adenocarcinoma; Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell; Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous; African Americans; Aged; Carcinoma, Endometrioid; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease-Free Survival; Endometrial Neoplasms; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Hypertension; Middle Aged; Obesity; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Protective Factors; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors",to evaluate the role of comorbid conditions as modifiers of endometrial cancer survival by race,MI,1990,2005,Retrospective cohort,henry ford health system (hfhs) tumor registry; medical record abstraction; metropolitan detroit cancer surveillance system (mdcss) registry,White,356,Black,271,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We used 2008 through 2011 linked State Inpatient Database and American Hospital Association data from 7 states, and designated hospitals with &gt;50% of deliveries to non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic women as white-, black-, and Hispanic-serving, respectively. We calculated indicator rates per 1000 deliveries by hospital type and, separately, for non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic women within each hospital type. We fitted multivariate Poisson regression models to examine associations between delivery-related indicators and patient and hospital characteristics by hospital type. White-serving hospitals offer obstetric care to an older and wealthier population than black- or Hispanic-serving hospitals. Rates of the most prevalent indicators examined (complicated vaginal delivery, complicated cesarean delivery, obstetric trauma) were lowest in Hispanic-serving hospitals. Generally, indicator rates were similar in Hispanic- and white-serving hospitals. Black-serving hospitals performed worse than other hospitals on 12 of 15 indicators. Indicator rates varied greatly by race/ethnicity in white- and Hispanic-serving hospitals, with non-Hispanic blacks having 1.19-3.27 and 1.15-2.68 times higher rates than non-Hispanic whites, respectively, for 11 of 15 indicators. Conversely, there were few indicator rate differences by race/ethnicity in black-serving hospitals, suggesting an overall lower performance of these hospitals compared to white- and Hispanic-serving hospitals. We found considerable differences in delivery-related indicators by hospital type and patients' race/ethnicity.

However, whether this pattern differs by age is unknown. Cervical cancer cases (1975-2009, N=36,503) were obtained from nine Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program registries. Age-standardized incidence rates for white and black women were calculated from 1975-1979 through 2005-2009 by age group (&lt;50, 50-64, and â‰¥65 years). Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) evaluated differences in rates for blacks vs. whites by age group and stage at diagnosis during 1975-1979 and 2005-2009. Among women aged &lt;50 years, the black-to-white disparity RR decreased from nearly two-fold (RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.7-2.1) during 1975-1979 to unity during 2005-2009 (RR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.8-1.0).

Patients with a diagnosis of invasive vaginal cancer were identified from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program from 1988 to 2007 and were divided into White (W) and African American (AA) subgroups. Student's t test, Kaplan-Meier survival methods, and Cox regression proportional hazards were performed. A total of 2675 patients met the inclusion criteria, with histologic distribution of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; 2190, 82%) and adenocarcinoma (AC; 485, 18%); 2294 (85.8%) were W, and 381 (14.2%) were AA. Median age was 69 for W and 65 for AA (p&lt;0.001). SCC and AC were equally distributed between W and AA. Advanced stage disease (FIGO III and IV) was more prominent in AA compared with W (30.4% vs. 23.1%, p=0.019). Radiation therapy was utilized equally in both racial groups; however, surgical treatment alone or combined with radiation therapy was more frequent in W compared with AA (27.7% vs. 17.5%, p&lt;0.001). The 5-year survival was 45% in W and 38.6% in AA (p=0.008). In multivariate analysis, AA had significantly poorer survival compared with Whites when controlling for age, histology, stage, grade and treatment modality (HR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.4, p=0.007). African American women with vaginal cancer were more likely to present, at a younger age, advanced stage and less likely to receive surgical treatment.

We used the US 2005 Natality data file. Analysis was limited to singleton births. The prevalence of cervical insufficiency was examined by the maternal characteristic for each racial group. Unconditional logistic regression modeling was used to assess the association between race and cervical insufficiency while controlling for confounders. Cervical insufficiency risk for Black women was more than twice that for their White counterparts [odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) of 2.45 (2.22-2.71)]. Prior pregnancy termination showed a dose-response relationship with cervical insufficiency. Compared with women with no history of prior pregnancy termination, primiparous women who have had one pregnancy termination had an OR (95% CI) of 2.49 (2.23-2.77). The OR for two, three and four or more terminations were 4.66 (4.07-5.33), 8.07 (6.77-9.61) and 12.36 (10.19-15.00), respectively. Other predictors of cervical insufficiency included previous preterm birth, parity, marital status, renal disease, history of diabetes, polyhydramnios and anemia. There were significant racial/ethnic disparities with Black women having increased cervical insufficiency risk, independent of other studied factors. Prior pregnancy termination is also a major risk factor for cervical insufficiency. The White/Black disparity is evident in both primiparous and multiparous women.","Abortion, Habitual; Adult; African Americans; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Parity; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; Risk Factors; United States; Uterine Cervical Incompetence",to examine racial/ethnic differences in cervical insufficiency risk,USA,2005,2005,Retrospective cohort,US 2005 Natality data file,White,852296,Black,166966,Asian/Pacific Islander,82965,American Indian/Alaskan Native,13314,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

In this retrospective cohort study, the National Inpatient Sample database was analyzed in patients with nonmetastatic endometrial cancer who underwent hysterectomy during 2012-2013. Hierarchical multiple logistic regression and propensity score matching were used to compare complications among patients treated with open compared with minimally invasive hysterectomy surgery. Cost of care was also compared using generalized linear modeling. We identified 9,799 patients; 52.4% underwent open and 47.6% minimally invasive hysterectomy. Many patients (43.4%) were treated at low-volume hospitals (less than 10 endometrial cancer cases annually). Patients were less likely to undergo open surgery in high-volume compared with low-volume hospitals (51.8% compared with 58.1%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.13-0.94) and more likely to undergo open surgery in rural compared with urban teaching hospitals (75.6% compared with 51.1%, respectively; adjusted OR 14.34, 95% CI 9.66-21.27), government compared with nonprofit hospitals (61.3% compared with 51.1%, respectively; adjusted OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.15-2.39), and in patients of black (67.9%; OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.30-1.65) and &quot;other&quot; race (60.5%; adjusted OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.99-2.87) compared with white race (49.2%, referent).

Approximately 79% of the population was aged 18-35 years, and almost half were nulliparous. Almost 20% of the women were African American, 36.4% were Hispanic, and 33.6% were white. Overall, 33.6% of periviable neonates were delivered by cesarean. In multivariable analyses adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, cesarean delivery did not differ among African American and Hispanic women compared with white women (odds ratio [OR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.05; and OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83-1.09, respectively). Women presenting with preterm labor were significantly less likely to undergo cesarean delivery (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.96), whereas women presenting with preterm premature rupture of membranes (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.14-1.45) or abruption (OR 2.43, 95% CI 2.09-2.81) were more likely to have cesarean deliveries.

Unlike disparities observed at later gestational ages, cesarean delivery did not differ by race and ethnicity among this periviable cohort. Instead, medical indications such as pregnancy-induced hypertension, preterm premature rupture of membranes, or abruption were associated with a higher likelihood of cesarean delivery. Periviable deliveries represent a subset of deliveries, wherein race and ethnicity do not influence mode of delivery; the acuity of the clinical encounter dictates the course of care.","Adolescent; Adult; African Americans; Cesarean Section; Comorbidity; Female; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced; Logistic Models; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; United States; Young Adult",To test for racial or ethnic disparities or both in periviable cesarean delivery and describe sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with periviable cesarean delivery,"CA, MO, PA",1995,2005,Retrospective cohort,statelevel maternal and neonatal hospital discharge data linked to vital statistics data for deliveries,White,2788,African American,1615,Hispanic,3015,Other,872,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to examine risk factors associated with advanced-stage (stage III or IV) disease at diagnosis. Multivariable Cox regression models were performed to explore risk factors associated with 5-year all-cause mortality.

Large racial differences in premenopausal hysterectomy rates between Black and White women in the United States likely affect calculation of race-based risk. The objectives of the study were to determine how the long-term trends in Black-White differences in endometrial cancer incidence and histology type have changed over time for women at risk. Using longitudinal Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data from 1997 to 2014 and state-level hysterectomy prevalence from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we calculated hysterectomy-adjusted incidence rates of endometrial cancer and the proportion of high vs low-risk endometrial cancer, by race, over time. In women older than 50 years who have not had a hysterectomy, endometrial cancer incidence is 87 per 100,000 from 1997 to 2014. Among White women endometrial cancer incidence changed from 102 (1997-2001) to 86 (2012-2014) cases per 100,000, with a nonsignificant decreasing linear trend (adjusted risk ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.00; p=0.05). In contrast, incidence for Black women was 88 (1997-2001), 101 (2002-2006), 100 (2007-2011), and 102 (2012-2014) cases per 100,000 with no decreasing trend (adjusted risk ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-1.10, PÂ = .449). High-risk histology increased among both groups (White: adjusted risk ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.11; PÂ = .015; Black: adjusted risk ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.10, PÂ = .007). Racial difference in the proportion of high-risk disease remained stable. Updated hysterectomy-adjusted incidence demonstrates that endometrial cancer is the second most common cancer among women older than 50 years with a uterus and that endometrial cancer has been more common among Black women compared with White women in the United States since 2002. A clinical approach of proactive communication and routine screening for early symptoms in the perimenopausal and menopausal years, especially among Black women, is warranted. These findings can also inform equitable distribution of research funding for endometrial cancer and serve to promote public awareness of this common cancer.","African-Americans; endometrial neoplasms; epidemiology; health status disparities; hysterectomy; Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell; African Americans; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Endometrioid; Carcinosarcoma; Endometrial Neoplasms; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Hysterectomy; Incidence; Middle Aged; Neoplasms, Cystic, Mucinous, and Serous; Prevalence; SEER Program; United States",to determine how the long-term trends in Black-White differences in endometrial cancer incidence and histology type have changed over time for women at risk.,"CT, CA, IA, KY, LA, NJ, UT, NM, AK",1997,2014,Retrospective cohort,"Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) -18 registry cohorts; behavioral risk factor surveillance system",White,-99,Black,-99,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

We conducted a retrospective cohort study among 25,251 black and white women delivering a live, singleton infant with vertex presentation at a large, regional hospital between 2004 and 2010. Demographic and clinical data were derived from electronic hospital records. Differences in risk factors for primary cesarean delivery were analyzed using a modified Poisson regression approach stratified by race and parity. Black and white women had a primary cesarean delivery rate of 24.7% and 22.2%, respectively (P &lt; .001). Black women had an increased risk of cesarean delivery after adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical risk factors (adjusted relative risk [RR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-1.29). Among nulliparas, labor induction had a greater effect on cesarean delivery for black women (adjusted RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.20-1.44) than for white women (adjusted RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.07-1.20). Among multiparas, labor induction reduced the risk of cesarean delivery for white women (adjusted RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.55-0.72), whereas no association was observed for black women (adjusted RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.92-1.28).

Among nulliparas, delivery at 37-38 weeks' gestation reduced the risk of cesarean delivery for black women (adjusted RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73-0.92), whereas no association was observed for white women (adjusted RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.90-1.04).

We examined whether the magnitude of the survival differential between black and white women varied based on hospital procedural volume for endometrial cancer. We utilized the National Cancer Data Base to examine women with endometrial cancer from 1998 to 2012. Annualized hospital procedural volume was calculated and hospitals grouped into volume-based quartiles. Multivariable models were developed to examine differences in two and five-year survival between black and white women across the hospital volume categories. Patients were classified as early or advanced stage and as type I (low grade, endometrioid) or type II (high grade endometrioid, other histologies) cancers. We identified 243,422 (75.0%) white and 27,764 (8.6%) black women treated at 1059 hospitals. Regardless of hospital volume, black women had decreased survival. For each tumor class, the absolute difference in adjusted two-year survival between black and white women decreased with increasing hospital volume. For example, for women with early-stage, type I tumors, the adjusted two-year survival differential between blacks and whites was -1.4% (95%CI, -2.4 to -0.5%) at low volume centers and decreased to -0.5% (95%CI, -0.9 to 0%) at high-volume hospitals (P&lt;0.0001). For advanced stage, type I tumors, the adjusted survival differential decreased from -12.4% (95%CI, -24.0 to -0.9%) to 1.2% (95%CI, -2.9 to 5.3%) at high volume hospitals (P&lt;0.0001). Black race is an independent predictor of mortality. The impact of race on mortality is mitigated, albeit not eliminated, by increasing hospital volume.","Black; Disparities; Endometrial cancer; Hysterectomy; Uterine cancer; Adult; African Americans; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Endometrioid; Endometrial Neoplasms; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Hispanic Americans; Hospitals; Humans; Middle Aged; United States",examined whether the magnitude of the survival differential between black and white women varied based on hospital procedural volume for endometrial cancer,USA,1998,2012,Retrospective cohort,National Cancer Data Base,White,243422,Black,27764,Hispanic,16266,Other,9918,Unknown,27132,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This study investigates disparities in TTI and the impact of TTI on overall survival (OS). Adult women with non-metastatic cervical squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed between 2004 and 2014, treated with definitive RT or CRT, and reported to the National Cancer Database were included. TTI was defined as days from diagnosis to start of RT or CRT. The impact of TTI on OS in patients treated with concurrent CRT which included brachytherapy was then assessed. Overall, 14,924 patients were included (84.7% CRT, 15.3% RT). TTI was significantly longer for Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.18) and Hispanic women (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.24) compared to Non-Hispanic White (NHW) women. Expected TTI (eTTI) for NHW, NHB, and Hispanic women were 38.1, 45.2, and 49.4days. eTTI rose from 36.2days in 2004 to 44.3days by 2014. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was associated with increased eTTI of 46.5days versus 40.0days for non-IMRT. Longer TTI was not associated with inferior OS in patients treated with concurrent CRT. Delays in starting RT/CRT for cervical cancer increased from 2004 to 2014. Delays disproportionately affect NHB and Hispanic women. However, increased TTI was not associated with increased mortality for women receiving CRT. Further study of TTI's impact on other endpoints is warranted to determine if TTI represents an important quality indicator.","Cervical cancer; Chemoradiation; Disparity; Ethnic; NCDB; Racial; Radiation; Adolescent; Adult; African Continental Ancestry Group; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brachytherapy; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Chemoradiotherapy; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Middle Aged; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated; Time-to-Treatment; United States; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Young Adult",to investigate the disparities in delays in time to treatment initiation and the impact of delays in time to treatment initiation on overall survival,USA,2004,2014,Retrospective cohort,National Cancer Database,Non-Hispanic White,8503,Non-Hispanic Black,2758,Hispanic,1975,Asian American and Pacific Islander,759,Other/Unknown,929,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The objective of this study was to determine risk for peripartum hysterectomy for women at low and moderate risk for the procedure. This population-based study used data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to characterize risk for peripartum hysterectomy. Women with a diagnosis of placenta accreta or prior cesarean and placenta previa were excluded. Obstetrical risk factors along with demographic and hospital factors were evaluated. Multivariable mixed-effects log-linear regression models were developed to determine adjusted risk. Based on these models receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted, and the area under the curve was determined to assess discrimination. Peripartum hysterectomy occurred in 1 in 1913 deliveries. Risk factors associated with significant risk for hysterectomy included mode of delivery, stillbirth, placental abruption, fibroids, and antepartum hemorrhage. These factors retained their significance in adjusted models: the risk ratio for stillbirth was 3.44 (95% confidence interval, 2.94-4.02), abruption 2.98 (95% confidence interval, 2.52-3.20), fibroids 3.63 (95% confidence interval, 3.22-4.08), and antepartum hemorrhage 7.15 (95% confidence interval, 6.16-8.32). The area under the curve for the model was 0.833. Peripartum hysterectomy is a relatively common event that hospitals providing routine obstetric care should be prepared to manage. That specific risk factors are highly associated with risk for hysterectomy supports routine use of hemorrhage risk-assessment tools. However, given that a significant proportion of hysterectomies will be unpredictable, the availability of rapid transfusion protocols may be necessary for hospitals to safely manage these cases.","atony; hysterectomy; postpartum hemorrhage; Adolescent; Adult; Databases, Factual; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Hysterectomy; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Obstetric Labor Complications; Peripartum Period; Pregnancy; ROC Curve; Regression Analysis; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Young Adult",to determine risk for peripartum hysterectomy for women at low and moderate risk for the procedure,USA,1998,2011,Retrospective cohort,Nationwide Inpatient Sample,White,22689016,Black,5673336,Hispanic,9741891,Other,4326777,Unknown,12784189,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Women diagnosed with EC between 1998 and 2010 were identified from the National Cancer Database. Variables associated with the outcomes of interest were assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression. Among 228,511 women identified, the percentage of blacks with stage IIIC/IV disease at diagnosis was nearly twice that of non-Hispanic whites (17.8% vs 9.8%; P&lt;0.001). Patients with advanced disease who were insured with Medicare were less likely to receive standard-of-care postoperative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy than those with private insurance (odds ratio: OR 0.80, P&lt;0.001), as were those residing in the South (reference) in comparison to the Northeast, Atlantic, Great Lakes, and Midwest regions (OR 1.3-1.7, all P&lt;0.001). Those residing in the Mountain region were even less likely to receive appropriate treatment (OR 0.7, P&lt;0.001). Five-year stage IIIC/IV survival was 42.8% for non-Hispanic whites vs 24.6% for blacks (hazard ratio 1.3, P&lt;0.001).

Numerous studies have shown disproportionately higher prevalence rates in Non-Hispanic Black women. Due to high rates of reinfection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends retesting women treated for trichomoniasis. Despite these national guidelines, there are few studies examining adherence to retesting recommendations for patients with trichomoniasis. Adherence to retesting guidelines has been shown in other infections to be an important determinant for racial disparities. The purpose of this study is to describe Trichomonas vaginalis infection rates, to evaluate adherence to retesting guidelines, and to examine characteristics of women who were not re-tested according to the guidelines in an urban, diverse, hospital-based Ob/Gyn clinic population. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients from a single hospital-based Ob/Gyn clinic who were tested for Trichomonas vaginalis between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2019. Descriptive statistics were used to examine guideline-concordant testing for reinfection amongst patients with trichomoniasis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify characteristics associated with testing positive and with appropriate retesting. Sub-group analyses were performed for patients who were pregnant and tested positive for Trichomonas vaginalis. Among the 8,809 patients tested for Trichomonas vaginalis, 799 (9.1%) tested positive at least once during the study. Factors associated with trichomoniasis included identifying as non-Hispanic Black (aOR 3.13, 95% CI 2.52-3.89), current or former tobacco smoker (aOR 2.27, 95% CI 1.94-2.65), and single marital status (aOR 1.96, 95% CI 1.51-2.56). Similar associated factors were found in the pregnant sub-group analysis. For women with trichomoniasis, guideline-concordant retesting rates were low across the entire population with only 27% (214/799) of patients retested within the recommended timeframe; 42% (82/194) of the pregnant sub-group underwent guideline concordant retesting. Non-Hispanic Black women had significantly lower odds of undergoing guideline-recommended retesting than non-Hispanic White women (aOR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31-0.92). Among patients tested within guideline recommendations, we found a high rate of Trichomonas vaginalis positivity at retesting: 24% in the entire cohort (51/214) and 33% in the pregnant sub-group (27/82).

The outcomes (modelled separately) were diagnoses of DM and GDM. From 2011 to 2019, there were increases in both the frequency (per 1000 live births; mean APC, 95% CI per year) of DM and GDM in rural areas (DM: 7.6 to 10.4 per 1000 live births; APC 2.8%, 95% CI 2.2%-3.4%; and GDM: 41.4 to 58.7 per 1000 live births; APC 3.1%, 95% CI 2.6%-3.6%) and urban areas (DM: 6.1 to 8.4 per 1000 live births; APC 3.3%, 95% CI 2.2%-4.4%; and GDM: 40.8 to 61.2 per 1000 live births; APC 3.9%, 95% CI 3.3%-4.6%). Individuals living in rural areas were at higher risk of DM (aRR 1.48, 95% CI 1.45%-1.51%) and GDM versus those in urban areas (aRR 1.17, 95% CI 1.16%-1.18%).

The objective of this study was to evaluate integration of 9vHPV inpatient vaccination into routine postpartum care. Obstetrics professionals at an academic urban referral center received an emailed protocol outlining a novel 9vHPV vaccination program of postpartum inpatients aged 26 years or younger. A retrospective evaluation from March 2021 to March 2022 was conducted to evaluate implementation. Characteristics of patients vaccinated before pregnancy compared with vaccine-eligible patients (none, unknown, or partially vaccinated status) were compared by the use of &#x3c7;2, analysis of variance, and multivariable logistic regression. Similarly, analyses were performed comparing vaccine-eligible patients who did with those who did not receive an inpatient 9vHPV vaccination. Of 569 postpartum inpatients, 370 (65.0%) were already vaccinated, 70 (34.2%) were never vaccinated, 49 (24.6%) were partially vaccinated, and 80 (14.1%) had unknown status. Of vaccine-eligible patients, 46 (23.1%) received 9vHPV vaccination as an inpatient. In multivariable analysis, race and ethnicity, marital status, and primary language were significant predictors of vaccination before pregnancy. Among vaccine-eligible patients, inpatient vaccination recipients were primarily Hispanic, Spanish speaking, and publicly insured. In multivariable analysis of vaccine-eligible patients, receiving care from the certified nurse midwifery practice was the only independent predictor of vaccination (odds ratio 2.4, 95% CI 1.02-5.74, P=.04). Non-Hispanic White, Spanish-speaking, and married patients were disproportionally undervaccinated in our baseline population, but about one quarter of vaccine-eligible patients received 9vHPV vaccination postpartum.

Perioperatively, the bedside nurse carries the greatest responsibility of direct care, which includes pain reassessment, a metric tracked for compliance. To critically assess disparities in OBGYN perioperative care and how these have changed since March 2020 using nursing pain reassessment compliance within a quality improvement framework. Retrospective cohort of 76,984 pain reassessment encounters from 10,774 OBGYN patients at a large, academic hospital 9/2017-3/2021 obtained from Tableau: Quality, Safety &amp; Risk Prevention platform. Non-compliance proportions were analyzed by patient race across service lines; a sensitivity analysis was performed excluding patients who were of neither Black nor White race. Secondary outcomes included analysis by patient ethnicity, BMI, age, language, procedure, and insurance. Additional analyses were performed temporally stratifying patients into pre- and post-March 2020 cohorts to investigate potential pandemic and sociopolitical effects on healthcare disparities. Continuous variables were assessed with Wilcoxon rank test, categorical variables were assessed with &#x3c7;2, and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed (p&lt;0.05). Pain reassessment non-compliance proportions did not differ significantly between Black and White patients as an aggregate of all OBGYN patients (8.1% vs 8.2%), but greater differences were found within the divisions of Benign Subspecialty Gynecologic Surgery (MIGS + Urogynecology) (14.9% vs 10.70%, p=0.03) and Maternal Fetal Medicine (9.5% vs 8.3%, p=0.04). Black patients admitted to Gynecologic Oncology experienced lower non-compliance proportions than White patients (5.6% vs 10.4%, p&lt;0.01). These differences persisted after adjustment for BMI, age, insurance, timeline, procedure type, and number of nurses attending to each patient with multivariable analyses. Non-compliance proportions were higher for patients with BMI&#x2265;35 kg/m2 within Benign Subspecialty Gynecology (17.9% vs 10.4%, p&lt;0.01). Non-Hispanic/Latino patients (p=0.03), those &#x2265;65 years (p&lt;0.01), those with Medicare (p&lt;0.01), and those who underwent hysterectomy (p&lt;0.01) also experienced greater non-compliance proportions. Aggregate non-compliance proportions differed slightly pre- and post-March 2020; this trend was seen across all service lines except Midwifery and was significant for Benign Subspecialty Gynecology after multivariable analysis (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.02-1.93, p=0.04). Though increases in non-compliance proportions were seen for non-White patients after March 2020, this was not statistically significant. Significant race, ethnicity, age, procedure, and BMI-based disparities were identified in the delivery of perioperative bedside care, especially for those admitted to Benign Subspecialty Gynecologic Services. Conversely, Black patients admitted to Gynecologic Oncology experienced lower levels of nursing non-compliance. Non-compliance proportions increased after March 2020 within Benign Subspecialty Gynecologic Services. Though this study was not designed to establish causation, possible contributing factors include implicit or explicit biases regarding pain experience across race, BMI, age, or surgical indication, discrepancies in pain management across hospital units, and downstream effects of healthcare worker burnout, understaffing, increased use of travelers, or socio-political polarization since March 2020.

We used data from four case-control studies and two case-control studies nested within prospective cohorts in the OCWAA (Ovarian Cancer in Women of African Ancestry) consortium. The study population included 3,124 Black participants and 5,458 White participants, of whom 1,008 Black participants and 2,237 White participants had ovarian cancer. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for the associations of endometriosis and leiomyomas with ovarian cancer risk, by race, stratified by histotype and hysterectomy. The prevalences of endometriosis and leiomyomas were 6.4% and 43.2% among Black participants and 7.0% and 21.5% among White participants, respectively. Endometriosis was associated with an increased risk of endometrioid and clear-cell ovarian cancer in both racial groups (eg, OR for endometrioid tumors for Black and White participants 7.06 [95% CI 3.86-12.91] and 2.17 [95% CI 1.36-3.45], respectively, Phetereogeneity=.003).

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 43,915 patients across four study sites in four states, of whom 3,013 (7.1%) had a documented contraceptive plan of permanent contraception at the time of postpartum discharge and either Medicaid insurance or private insurance. Our primary outcome was permanent contraception fulfillment before hospital discharge; we compared individuals with private insurance with individuals with Medicaid insurance. Secondary outcomes were permanent contraception fulfillment within 42 and 365 days of delivery, as well as the rate of subsequent pregnancy after nonfulfillment. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used. Patients with Medicaid insurance (1,096/2,076, 52.8%), compared with those with private insurance (663/937, 70.8%), were less likely to receive desired permanent contraception before hospital discharge (P&#x2264;.001). After adjustment for age, parity, weeks of gestation, mode of delivery, adequacy of prenatal care, race, ethnicity, marital status, and body mass index, private insurance status was associated with higher odds of fulfillment at discharge (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.48, 95% CI 1.17-1.87) and 42 days (aOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.13-1.80) and 365 days (aOR 1.36, 95% CI 1.08-1.71) postpartum.

RNA sequencing, tissue microarray, and immunohistochemistry data revealed that Black and White women have significant differences in their myometrium and leiomyoma profiles. Black women develop uterine leiomyoma earlier than White women, and are more likely to be anemic, have multiple tumors, undergo hysterectomy at an earlier age, have a higher uterine weight, and report very severe pelvic pain. Uterine tissues were collected from premenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy or myomectomy at Northwestern University Prentice Women's Hospital (Chicago, IL) from 2010 to 2021. Tissues were collected from a total of 309 women, including from 136 Black women, 135 White women, and 38 women from other racial groups. A total of 529 uterine leiomyomas (290 from Black women, 184 from White women, and 55 from women of other racial groups) were subjected to molecular analysis. Leiomyoma and matched myometrium from a total of 118 cases including 60 Black women and 58 White women, were used for tissue microarrays, along with 34 samples of myometrium without leiomyoma from White women.

We used a quasiexperimental difference-in-difference multivariable Cox regression analysis to compare 2-year survival between states that expanded Medicaid in January 2014 and states that did not expand Medicaid as of 2016. We performed univariable subgroup difference-in-difference Cox regression analyses on the basis of stage, income, race, ethnicity, and geographic location. Adjusted linear difference-in-difference regressions evaluated the proportion of uninsured patients on the basis of expansion status after 2014. We evaluated adjusted Kaplan-Meier curves to examine differences on the basis of study period and expansion status. Our sample included 169,731 women, including 78,669 (46.3%) in expansion states and 91,062 (53.7%) in nonexpansion states. There was improved 2-year survival on adjusted difference-in-difference Cox regressions for women with ovarian cancer in expansion than in nonexpansion states after 2014 (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.94; P&lt;.001) with no differences in endometrial, cervical, vaginal, vulvar, or combined gynecologic cancer sites on the basis of expansion status. On univariable subgroup difference-in-difference Cox analyses, women with ovarian cancer with stage III-IV disease (P=.008), non-Hispanic ethnicity (P=.042), those in the South (P=.016), and women with vulvar cancer in the Northeast (P=.022), had improved 2-year survival in expansion than in nonexpansion states after 2014. In contrast, women with cervical cancer in the South (P=.018) had worse 2-year survival in expansion than in nonexpansion states after 2014. All cancer sites had lower proportions of uninsured patients in expansion than in nonexpansion states after&#xa0;2014. There was a significant association between Medicaid expansion and improved 2-year survival for women with ovarian cancer in states that expanded Medicaid after 2014.

Although it is known that nonpregnant patients are often reluctant to share their genetic data for research, pregnant patients' knowledge of, and opinions about, genetic data privacy are unknown. We investigated whether pregnant patients who had already undergone cell-free DNA screening were aware that genetic data derived from cell-free DNA may be shared for research. Furthermore, we examined whether pregnant patients exposed to video education about the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act-a federal law that mandates workplace and health insurance protections against genetic discrimination-were more willing to share cell-free DNA-related genetic data for research than pregnant patients who were unexposed. In this randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04420858), English-speaking patients with singleton pregnancies who underwent cell-free DNA and subsequently presented at 17 0/7 to 23 6/7 weeks of gestation for a detailed anatomy scan were randomized 1:1 to a control or intervention group. Both groups viewed an infographic about cell-free DNA. In addition, the intervention group viewed an educational video about the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. The primary outcomes were knowledge about, and willingness to share, prenatal genetic data from cell-free DNA by commercial laboratories for nonclinical purposes, such as research. The secondary outcomes included knowledge about existing genetic privacy laws, knowledge about the potential for reidentification of anonymized genetic data, and acceptability of various use and sharing scenarios for prenatal genetic data. Eighty-one participants per group were required for 80% power to detect an increase in willingness to share data from 60% to 80% (&#x3b1;=0.05). A total of 747 pregnant patients were screened, and 213 patients were deemed eligible and approached for potential study participation. Of these patients, 163 (76.5%) consented and were randomized; one participant discontinued the intervention, and two participants were excluded from analysis after the intervention when it was discovered that they did not fulfill all eligibility criteria. Overall, 160 (75.1%) of those approached were included in the final analysis. Most patients in the control group (72 [90.0%]) and intervention (76 [97.4%]) group were either unsure about or incorrectly thought that cell-free DNA companies could not share prenatal genetic data for research. Participants in the intervention group were more likely to incorrectly believe that their prenatal genetic data would not be shared for nonclinical purposes than participants in the control group (28.8% in the control group vs 46.2% in the intervention; P=.03). However, video education did not increase participant willingness to share genetic data in multiple scenarios. Non-White participants were less willing than White participants to allow sharing of genetic data specifically for academic research (P&lt;.001). Most participants were unaware that their prenatal genetic data may be used for nonclinical purposes. Pregnant patients who were educated about the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act were not more willing to share genetic data than those who did not receive this education. Surprisingly, video education about the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act led patients to falsely believe that their data would not be shared for research, and participants who identified as racial minorities were less willing to share genetic data.

This cohort study included pregnant patients who presented for childbirth at two hospitals in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from April 13 to December 31, 2020. Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was determined by measuring immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in discarded maternal serum samples obtained for clinical purposes. Race and ethnicity were self-reported and abstracted from medical records. Patients' residential addresses were geocoded to obtain three Census tract variables: community deprivation, racial segregation (Index of Concentration at the Extremes), and crowding. Multivariable mixed effects logistic regression models and causal mediation analyses were used to quantify the extent to which neighborhood variables may explain racial and ethnic disparities in seropositivity. Among 5,991 pregnant patients, 562 (9.4%) were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. Higher seropositivity rates were observed among Hispanic (19.3%, 104/538) and Black (14.0%, 373/2,658) patients, compared with Asian (3.2%, 13/406) patients, White (2.7%, 57/2,133) patients, and patients of another race or ethnicity (5.9%, 15/256) (P&lt;.001). In adjusted models, per SD increase, deprivation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.16, 95% CI 1.02-1.32) and crowding (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.05-1.26) were associated with seropositivity, but segregation was not (aOR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78-1.04). Mediation analyses revealed that crowded housing may explain 6.7% (95% CI 2.0-14.7%) of the Hispanic-White disparity and that neighborhood deprivation may explain 10.2% (95% CI 0.5-21.1%) of the Black-White disparity.

Differences in adjuvant treatment have been proposed to be major contributors to this disparity. However, little is known about the differences in type or timing of adjuvant treatment as it relates to race and ethnicity in the Medicare population. This study aimed to examine patterns of adjuvant therapy and survival for non-Hispanic Black women vs non-Hispanic White women and Hispanic women who have undergone surgery for high-grade endometrial cancer in the Medicare population. We used the Medicare-linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to identify women who underwent surgery as a primary treatment for uterine grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma, carcinosarcoma, clear-cell carcinoma, or serous carcinoma between the years 2000 and 2015. Women who did not identify as White or Black race or Hispanic ethnicity were excluded. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for receiving a treatment delay or not receiving adjuvant treatment (compared with those who received adjuvant treatment within 12 weeks) adjusted for clinical and demographic characteristics. Overall survival was stratified by race and ethnicity, route of surgery, operative complications, and type and timing of adjuvant therapy, which were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio of death by race and ethnicity adjusted for known predictors and surgical outcomes and adjuvant therapy patterns. A total of 12,201 women met the study inclusion criteria. Non-Hispanic Black patients had a significantly worse 5-year overall survival than Hispanic and non-Hispanic White patients (30.9 months vs 51.0 months vs 53.6 months, respectively). Approximately 632 of 7282 patients (8.6%) who received adjuvant treatment experienced a treatment delay. Delay in treatment of &#x2265;12 weeks was significantly different by race and ethnicity (P=.034), with 12% of Hispanic, 9% of non-Hispanic Black, and 8% of non-Hispanic White women experiencing a delay. After adjustment for the number of complications, age, histology (endometrioid vs nonendometroid), International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, marital status, comorbidity count, surgical approach, lymph node dissection, and urban-rural code, Hispanic women had a 71% increased risk of treatment delay (odds ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-2.38) for all stages of disease. In the same model, non-Hispanic Black race was independently predictive of decreased use of adjuvant treatment for the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage II and higher (odds ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.68). Non-Hispanic Black race, number of perioperative complications, and nonendometrioid histology were predictive of worse survival in univariate models. Treatment delay was not independently predictive of worse 1- or 5-year survival at any stage. Non-Hispanic Black race was predictive of worse 5-year survival across all stages and was associated with omission of adjuvant treatment in International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage II or higher high-grade endometrial cancer. In unadjusted analyses, patients who experience treatment omission or delay experienced poorer overall survival, but these factors were not independently associated in multivariate analyses. This study suggests that race and ethnicity are independently associated with the type and timing of adjuvant treatment in patients with high-grade endometrial cancer. Further efforts to identify specific causes of barriers to care and timely treatment are imperative.","adjuvant Treatment; high-grade endometrial cancer; racial disparities; Aged; Carcinoma, Endometrioid; Carcinosarcoma; Endometrial Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Medicare; Neoplasm Staging; United States",to examine patterns of adjuvant therapy and survival for non-Hispanic Black women vs non-Hispanic White women and Hispanic women who have undergone surgery for high-grade endometrial cancer in the Medicare population,USA,2000,2015,Retrospective cohort,"surveillance, epidemiology, and end results",Non-Hispanic White,9891,Non-Hispanic Black,1474,Hispanic,656,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This study evaluated tumor miRNA expression by race, clinical and tumor characteristics, and survival outcomes. FFPE tumor tissue from hysterectomy specimens was identified for 29 AA cases. Case matching was performed by computer-based random assignment in a 1:1 ratio with Caucasian controls based on age, stage and histologic subtype (pure vs. mixed). RNA was extracted from 77 specimens (54 tumors and 23 matched normal endometrium). MicroRNA array profiling was performed by microRNA Hi-Power Labeling (Hy3/Hy5) and hybridization to miRCURY LNA microRNA Array 7th Gen. Clinical and treatment characteristics were similar for cases and controls, although use of adjuvant radiation was less common in African Americans (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.03). Of 968 miRNAs analyzed, 649 were differentially expressed in normal endometrium vs. tumor. When compared by race, histologic subtype, stage or presence of LVI, no differentially expressed miRNAs were identified. In patients with disease recurrence at 3&#xa0;years, the three most upregulated miRNAs were miR-1, miR-21-5p and miR-223. Of these, increased miR-223 expression (&gt;median) was associated with worse OS (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0496) in an independent dataset (TCGA dataset) comprising of 140 patients with USC (mixed or pure serous). After adjusting for age, ethnicity and BMI, upregulation of miR-223 remained risk factor for death (adjusted HR 2.87, 95% CI 1.00-8.27).

All women undergoing abdominal myomectomy in California from 2005 to 2012 were identified from the OSHPD (Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development) using appropriate International Classification of Diseases and Current Procedural Terminology codes. Demographics, comorbidities, surgical approaches, and complications occurring within 30 days of the procedure were identified. Multivariate associations were assessed with mixed effects logistic regression models. The cohort of 35,151 women was racially and ethnically diverse (White, 38.8%; Black, 19.9%; Hispanic, 20.3%; and Asian, 15.3%). Among all procedures, 33,906 were performed through an open abdominal approach, and 1,245 were performed using a minimally invasive approach. Proportionally, Black patients were more likely than White patients to have open procedures, and open approaches were associated with higher complication rates. Overall, 2,622 (7.5%) women suffered at least one complication. Although severe complications did not vary by race or ethnicity, Black (9.0%), Hispanic (7.9%), and Asian (7.5%) patients were more likely to suffer complications of any severity compared with White patients (6.7%, P&lt;.001). As compared with patients with private insurance (6.4%), those with indigent payer status (Medicaid [12.1%] and self-pay [11.1%]) had higher complication rates (P&lt;.001). Controlling for all factors, Black and Asian patients were more likely to suffer complications compared with White patients. The overall complication rate after abdominal myomectomy was 7.5%.

Using data from CONCORD-3, we analyzed cervical cancer survival trends by race, stage and period of diagnosis. Data from 41 state-wide population-based cancer registries on 138,883 women diagnosed with cervical cancer during 2001-2014 were available. Vital status was followed up until December 31, 2014. We estimated age-standardized five-year net survival, by race (Black or White), stage and calendar period of diagnosis (2001-2003, 2004-2008, 2009-2014) in each state, and for all participating states combined. White women were most commonly diagnosed with localized tumors (45-50%). However, for Black women, localized tumors were the most common stage (43.0%) only during 2001-2003. A smaller proportion of Black women received cancer-directed surgery than White women. For all stages combined, five-year survival decreased between 2001-2003 and 2009-2014 for both White (64.7% to 63.0%) and Black (56.7% to 55.8%) women. For localized and regional tumors, survival increased over the same period for both White (by 2-3%) and Black women (by 5%). Survival did not change for Black women diagnosed with distant tumors but increased by around 2% for White women. Despite similar screening coverage for both Black and White women and improvements in stage-specific survival, Black women still have poorer survival than White women. This may be partially explained by inequities in access to optimal treatment.

Median overall survival was 61.1 months in White patients and 49.3 months in Black patients (P &lt; 0.0001). Our data suggest that while Black patients and patients who receive non-NCCN guideline directed care have worse survival outcomes, guideline adherence is not independently associated with Black race. We must consider other socioeconomic, environmental and system factors that are contributing to the survival discrepancy in Black patients with ovarian cancer.","Ovarian cancer disparities; Ovarian cancer survival; Racial disparities; Black People; Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial; Databases, Factual; Female; Guideline Adherence; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Middle Aged; Ovarian Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; White People",to determine whether guideline non-adherence is associated with Black race,USA,2012,2016,Retrospective cohort,National Cancer Database,White,27744,Black,2204,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Because there are competing positive and negative sequelae associated with surgical menopause, clinical guidelines have not been definitive. Previous research indicates that White women have higher rates of surgical menopause than other racial groups. However, previous studies may have underestimated the rates of surgical menopause among Black women. Furthermore, clinical practice has changed dramatically in the past 15 years, and there are no population-based studies in which more recent data were used. Tracking actual racial differences among women with surgical menopause is important for ensuring equity in gynecologic care. This population-based surveillance study evaluated racial differences in the rates of surgical menopause in all inpatient and outpatient settings in a large, racially diverse US state with historically high rates of hysterectomy. We evaluated all inpatient and outpatient surgeries in North Carolina from 2011 to 2014 for patients aged between 20 and 44 years. Surgical menopause was defined as a bilateral oophorectomy, with or without an accompanying hysterectomy, among North Carolina residents. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and Current Procedural Terminology codes were used to identify inpatient and outpatient procedures, respectively, and diagnostic indications. We estimated age-, race-, and ethnicity-specific rates of surgical menopause using county-specific population estimates based on the 2010 United States census. We used Poisson regression with deviance-adjusted residuals to estimate the incidence rate ratios in the entire state population. We tested changes in surgery rates over time (reference year, 2011), differences by setting (reference, inpatient), and differences by race and ethnicity (reference, non-Hispanic White). We then described the surgery rates between non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black patients. Between 2011 and 2014, 11,502 surgical menopause procedures for benign indications were performed in North Carolina among reproductive-aged residents. Most (95%) of these surgeries occurred concomitant with a hysterectomy. Over the 4-year study period, there was a 39% reduction in inpatient surgeries (incidence rate ratio, 0.61) and a 100% increase in outpatient surgeries (incidence rate ratio, 2.0). Restricting the analysis to surgeries among non-Hispanic White and Black patients, the increase in outpatient surgeries was significantly higher among non-Hispanic Black women (P&lt;.01) for year-race interaction (reference, 2011 and non-Hispanic White). The overall rates of bilateral oophorectomy for non-Hispanic Black women rose more quickly than for non-Hispanic White women (P&lt;.01). In 2011, the rate of surgical menopause was greater among White women than among Black women (17.7 vs 13.2 per 10,000 women). By 2014, the racial trends were reversed (rate, 24.8 per 10,000 for non-Hispanic White women and 28.4 per 10,000 for non-Hispanic Black women). Our findings suggest that the rates of surgical menopause increased in North Carolina in the early 2010s, especially among non-Hispanic Black women. By 2014, the rates of surgical menopause among non-Hispanic Black women had surpassed that of non-Hispanic White women. Given the long-term health consequences associated with surgical menopause, we propose potential drivers for the racially-patterned increases in the application of bilateral oophorectomy before the age of 45 years.",bilateral oophorectomy; health disparities; population-based; premenopausal; Adult; Black or African American; Ambulatory Surgical Procedures; Female; Humans; Hysterectomy; North Carolina; Ovariectomy; Population Surveillance; Postmenopause; White People; Young Adult,"to evaluate racial differences in the rates of surgical menopause in all inpatient and outpatient settings in a large, racially diverse US state with historically high rates of hysterectomy",NC,2011,2014,Retrospective cohort,"north carolina hospital discharge data; north carolina ambulatory surgical visit data; surveillance, epidemiology, and end results",Hispanic,412,Non-Hispanic White,7887,Non-Hispanic Black,2843,Non-Hispanic Native American,207,Non-Hispanic Asian,95,Non-Hispanic Other,468,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

This study aimed to examine the effect of discontinuing methadone and buprenorphine in women with opioid use disorder in the year following delivery and determine the extent to which maternal and infant characteristics are associated with time to discontinuation of medications for opioid use disorder. This population-based retrospective cohort study used linked administrative data of 211,096 deliveries in Massachusetts between 2011 and 2014 to examine the adherence to medications for opioid use disorder. Individuals receiving medications for opioid use disorder after delivery were included in the study. Here, demographic, psychosocial, prenatal, and delivery characteristics are described. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression modeling were used to examine factors associated with medication discontinuation. A total of 2314 women who received medications for opioid use disorder at delivery were included in our study. Overall, 1484 women (64.1%) continued receiving medications for opioid use disorder for a full 12 months following delivery. The rate of continued medication use varied from 34% if women started on medications for opioid use disorder the month before delivery to 80% if the medications were used throughout pregnancy. Kaplan-Meier survival curves differed by maternal race and ethnicity (the 12-month continuation probability was .65 for White non-Hispanic women and .51 for non-White women; P&lt;.001) and duration of use of prenatal medications for opioid use disorder (12-month continuation probability was .78 for women with full prenatal engagement and .60 and .44 for those receiving medications for opioid use disorder &#x2265;5 months [but not throughout pregnancy] and &#x2264;4 months prenatally, respectively; P&lt;.001). In all multivariable models, duration of receipt of prenatal medications for opioid use disorder (&#x2264;4 months vs throughout pregnancy: adjusted hazard ratio, 3.26; 95% confidence interval, 2.72-3.91) and incarceration (incarceration during pregnancy or after delivery vs none: adjusted hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-2.12) were most strongly associated with the discontinuation of medications for opioid use disorder. Almost two-thirds of women with opioid use disorder continued using medications for opioid use disorder for a full year after delivery; however, the rates of medication continuation varied significantly by race and ethnicity, degree of use of prenatal medications for opioid use disorder, and incarceration status. Prioritizing medication continuation across the perinatal continuum, enhancing sex-specific and family-friendly recovery supports, and expanding access to medications for opioid use disorder despite being incarcerated can help improve postpartum medication adherence.","adherence; buprenorphine; discontinuation; disparities; medication for drug use disorder; methadone; opioid use disorder; perinatal continuum; postpartum; substance use disorder; Adult; Black or African American; Analgesics, Opioid; Buprenorphine; Correctional Facilities; Ethnicity; Female; Hispanic or Latino; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Medication Adherence; Methadone; Opiate Substitution Treatment; Opioid-Related Disorders; Postpartum Period; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Proportional Hazards Models; White People; Young Adult",to examine the discontinuation of methadone and buprenorphine among women with opioid use disorder in the year following delivery and determine the extent to which maternal and infant characteristics are associated with time to discontinuation of MOUD,MA,2011,2014,Retrospective cohort,Public Health Data Warehouse,White non-Hispanic,2085,Black non-Hispanic,56,Hispanic,130,Other,39,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Understanding differences in pregnancy-related mortality across and within urban and rural areas can guide the development of interventions for preventing future pregnancy-related deaths. We sought to compare pregnancy-related mortality across and within urban and rural counties by race and ethnicity and age. We conducted a descriptive analysis of 3747 pregnancy-related deaths during 2011-2016 (the most recent available data) with available zone improvement plan code or county data in the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System, among Hispanic and non-Hispanic White, Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Asian or Pacific Islander women aged 15 to 44 years. We aggregated data by US county and grouped counties per the National Center for Health Statistics Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties. We used R statistical software, epitools, to calculate the pregnancy-related mortality ratio (number of pregnancy-related deaths per 100,000 live births) for each urban-rural grouping, obtain 95% confidence intervals, and perform exact tests of ratio comparisons using the Poisson distribution. Of the total 3747 pregnancy-related deaths analyzed, 52% occurred in large metro counties, and 7% occurred in noncore (rural) counties. Large metro counties had the lowest pregnancy-related mortality ratio (14.8; 95% confidence interval, 14.2-15.5), whereas noncore counties had the highest (24.1; 95% confidence interval, 21.4-27.1), including race and ethnicity and age groups. Pregnancy-related mortality ratio age disparities increased with rurality. Women aged 25 to 34 years and 35 to 44 years living in noncore counties had pregnancy-related mortality ratios 1.5 and 3 times higher, respectively, than women of the same age groups in large metro counties. Within each urban-rural category, pregnancy-related mortality ratios were higher among non-Hispanic Black women than non-Hispanic White women. Non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native pregnancy-related mortality ratios in small metro, micropolitan, and noncore counties were 2 to 3 times that of non-Hispanic White women in the same areas. Although more than half of pregnancy-related deaths occurred in large metro counties, the pregnancy-related mortality ratio rose with increasing rurality. Disparities existed in urban-rural categories, including by age group and race and ethnicity. Geographic location is an important context for initiatives to prevent future deaths and eliminate disparities. Further research is needed to better understand reasons for the observed urban-rural differences and to guide a multifactorial response to reduce pregnancy-related deaths.","Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System; age disparities; maternal death; maternal mortality; metropolitan; noncore; policy; pregnancy-related death; racial and ethnic disparities; Adolescent; Adult; Black or African American; Age Distribution; Asian; Female; Health Status Disparities; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Indians, North American; Maternal Mortality; Pregnancy; Rural Population; United States; Urban Population; White People; Young Adult",to compare pregnancy-related mortality across and within urban and rural counties by race and ethnicity and age,USA,2011,2016,Retrospective cohort,National Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System,White,12738577,Black,3500990,American Indian or Alaska Native,225937,Asian or Pacific Islander,1562250,Hispanic,5472466,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

This study aimed to describe the distribution of cervical length and frequency of funneling and debris at midgestation in nulliparous women by gestational age and race/ethnicity. This secondary analysis of screening data from a multicenter treatment trial of singleton nulliparous patients with short cervix was conducted at 14 geographically distributed, university-affiliated medical centers in the United States. Singleton nulliparous patients with no known risk factors for preterm birth were screened for trial participation and asked to undergo a transvaginal ultrasound to measure cervical length by a certified sonographer. The distribution of cervical length and the frequency of funneling and debris were assessed for each gestational age week (16-22 weeks) and stratified by self-reported race and ethnicity, which for this study were categorized as White, Black, Hispanic, and other. Patients enrolled in the randomized trial were excluded from this analysis. A total of 12,407 nulliparous patients were included in this analysis. The racial or ethnic distribution of the study participants was as follows: White, 41.6%; Black, 29.6%; Hispanic, 24.2%; and others, 4.6%. The 10th percentile cervical length for the entire cohort was 31.1 mm and, when stratified by race and ethnicity, 31.9 mm for White, 30.2 mm for Black, 31.4 mm for Hispanic, and 31.2 mm for patients of other race and ethnicity (P&lt;.001). At each gestational age, the cervical length corresponding to the tenth percentile was shorter in Black patients. The 25 mm value commonly used to define a short cervix and thought to represent the 10th percentile ranged from 1.3% to 5.4% across gestational age weeks and 1.0% to 3.8% across race and ethnicity groups. Black patients had the highest rate of funneling (2.6%), whereas Hispanic and Black patients had higher rates of intraamniotic debris than White and other patients (P&lt;.001).

Pregnant patients can serve as a model for the success of clinical and public health responses during public health emergencies as they are typically in frequent contact with the medical system. Population-based estimates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in pregnancy are unknown because of incomplete ascertainment of pregnancy status or inclusion of only single centers or hospitalized cases. Whether pregnant women were protected by the public health response or through their interactions with obstetrical providers in the early months of pandemic is not clearly understood. This study aimed to estimate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate in pregnancy and to examine the disparities by race and ethnicity and English language proficiency in Washington State. Pregnant patients with a polymerase chain reaction-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection diagnosed between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020 were identified within 35 hospitals and clinics, capturing 61% of annual deliveries in Washington State. Infection rates in pregnancy were estimated overall and by Washington State Accountable Community of Health region and cross-sectionally compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rates in similarly aged adults in Washington State. Race and ethnicity and language used for medical care of pregnant patients were compared with recent data from Washington State. A total of 240 pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections were identified during the study period with 70.7% from minority racial and ethnic groups. The principal findings in our study were as follows: (1) the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate was 13.9 per 1000 deliveries in pregnant patients (95% confidence interval, 8.3-23.2) compared with 7.3 per 1000 (95% confidence interval, 7.2-7.4) in adults aged 20 to 39 years in Washington State (rate ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.3); (2) the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate reduced to 11.3 per 1000 deliveries (95% confidence interval, 6.3-20.3) when excluding 45 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 detected through asymptomatic screening (rate ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-1.9); (3) the proportion of pregnant patients in non-White racial and ethnic groups with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 infection was 2- to 4-fold higher than the race and ethnicity distribution of women in Washington State who delivered live births in 2018; and (4) the proportion of pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection receiving medical care in a non-English language was higher than estimates of pregnant patients receiving care with limited English proficiency in Washington State (30.4% vs 7.6%). The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate in pregnant people was 70% higher than similarly aged adults in Washington State, which could not be completely explained by universal screening at delivery. Pregnant patients from nearly all racial and ethnic minority groups and patients receiving medical care in a non-English language were overrepresented. Pregnant women were not protected from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in the early months of the pandemic. Moreover, the greatest burden of infections occurred in nearly all racial and ethnic minority groups. These data coupled with a broader recognition that pregnancy is a risk factor for severe illness and maternal mortality strongly suggested that pregnant people should be broadly prioritized for coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine allocation in the United States similar to some states.","Alaskan Native; American Indian; Black; Hispanic; Pacific Islander; Washington State; coronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; ethnic disparity; fetus; infection rate; pregnancy; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Adult; COVID-19; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Racial Groups; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Washington; Young Adult",to estimate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate in pregnancy and to examine the disparities by race and ethnicity and English language proficiency in Washington State,WA,2020,2020,Retrospective cohort,multiple institution EHR,Hispanic,16136,"American Indian or Alaska Native, non-Hispanic",1214,"Asian, non-Hispanic",8851,"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic",1203,"Black, non-Hispanic",4171,"White, non-Hispanic",49567,Multiracial or other,3777,Unknown,1370,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

Virtual visit data of 270 gynecology oncology patients at a single institution from March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020 was obtained by querying a cohort discovery tool. Through geocoding, the CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) was utilized to assign social vulnerability indices to each patient and the results were analyzed for trends and statistical significance. African American patients were the most vulnerable with a median SVI of 0.71, Asian 0.60, Hispanic 0.41, and Caucasian 0.21. Eighty-seven percent of patients in this study were Caucasian, 8.9% African American, 3.3% Hispanic, and 1.1% Asian, which is comparable to the baseline institutional gynecologic cancer population. The mean census tract SVI variable when comparing patients to all census tracts in the United States was 0.31 (range 0.00 least vulnerable to 0.98 most vulnerable). Virtual visits were utilized by patients of all ages and gynecologic cancer types. African Americans were the most socially vulnerable patients of the cohort.

After adjustment, allostatic load was associated with cardiovascular disease risk (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.0, 95% CI 1.8-2.3), hypertension (aOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.8-2.4) and metabolic disorder (aOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-2.1). Allostatic load was a partial mediator between race and cardiovascular disease risk. Race did not significantly moderate this relationship. High allostatic load during pregnancy is associated with cardiovascular disease risk.

In endometrial cancer, Black patients are reported to have higher incidence of aggressive endometrial cancer subtypes and higher death rates than White women. To date, diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers associated with race-specific methylation driven genes have yet to be identified. The objective of this study was to explore DNA methylation patterns in endometrial tumor samples from White and Black women. Differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified in White tumor samples compared to Black tumor samples using Endometrial Carcinoma (EC) methylation and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Survival analysis was performed using survival R package and results were visualized using Kaplan-Meier plots. To access the correlation between changes in methylation and gene expression, we downloaded raw RNA-sequencing by Expectation-Maximization (RSEM) counts data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using TCGABiolinks package (v2.18.0). Our analysis revealed 704 differentially methylated CpGs in tumors from Black and White women. These differentially methylated genes showed strong negative correlation with gene expression and statistically significant enrichment in regulatory regions such as DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHSs) and transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Increased variability in methylation occurred in genes such as the insulin signaling pathway in Black tumor samples. By using two independent statistical method based on means (DMR, DMCs) and variances (DVCs) on the endometrial carcinoma TCGA data, we showed that endometrial tumors from Black women are hypomethylated and more hypervariable than tumors from White women. In-depth investigation of these methylation driven markers can aid in successful management of endometrial cancer disparities and improved overall survival in Black and White populations.","Endometrial cancer; Enrichment; Expression; Methylation-driven markers; Race; Humans; Female; DNA Methylation; Endometrial Neoplasms; Black People; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; White People",To explore DNA methylation patterns in endometrial tumor samples from White and Black women,USA,-99,-99,Case-control,The Cancer Genome Atlas,White,294,Black,99,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We conducted a population-based cohort study of patients aged 18-45 years who were diagnosed with cervical cancer (stage IA, IB), endometrial cancer (grade 1, stage IA, IB), or ovarian cancer (stage IA, IC) between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2015, using linked data from the CCR (California Cancer Registry), the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology. The primary outcome was receipt of fertility-sparing treatment , defined as surgical or medical treatment to preserve the uterus and at least one ovary. The secondary outcome was fertility preservation , defined as ART use after cancer diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% CIs for the association between fertility-sparing treatment and exposures of interest: age at diagnosis, race and ethnicity, health insurance, socioeconomic status, rurality, and parity. We identified 7,736 patients who were diagnosed with cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer with eligible histology. There were 850 (18.8%) fertility-sparing procedures among 4,521 cases of cervical cancer, 108 (7.2%) among 1,504 cases of endometrial cancer, and 741 (43.3%) among 1,711 cases of ovarian cancer. Analyses demonstrated nonuniform patterns of sociodemographic disparities by cancer type for fertility-sparing treatment, and ART. Fertility-sparing treatment was more likely among young patients, overall, and of those in racial and ethnic minority groups among survivors of cervical and ovarian cancer. Use of ART was low (n=52) and was associated with a non-Hispanic White race and ethnicity designation, being of younger age (18-35 years), and having private insurance. This study demonstrates that clinical and sociodemographic disparities exist in the receipt of fertility-sparing treatment and ART use among patients with a history of cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer.","Pregnancy; Female; Humans; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Cohort Studies; Ethnicity; Minority Groups; Endometrial Neoplasms; Ovarian Neoplasms; Reproductive Techniques, Assisted; Fertility Preservation; Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial; Neoplasm Staging; Retrospective Studies","To assess the presence of sociodemographic and clinical disparities in fertility-sparing treatment and assisted reproductive technology (ART) use among patients with a history of cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer",CA,2000,2015,Retrospective cohort,california cancer registry; california department of health care access and information); society for assisted reproductive technology clinic outcome reporting system,American Indian,-99,Asian or Pacific Islander,1163,Hispanic,2770,Non-Hispanic Black,324,Non-Hispanic White,3298,None of the above,56,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Innovative group prenatal care models, such as CenteringPregnancy, have been proposed as a potential approach to improve the rates of preterm birth and low birthweight and to reduce disparities in these pregnancy outcomes. This study aimed to test whether participation in group prenatal care would reduce the rates of preterm birth and low birthweight compared with individual prenatal care and whether group prenatal care would reduce the racial disparity in these rates between Black and White patients. This was a randomized controlled trial among medically low-risk pregnant patients at a single study site. Eligible patients were stratified by self-identified race and ethnicity and randomly allocated 1:1 between group and individual prenatal care. The primary outcomes were preterm birth at &lt;37 weeks of gestation and low birthweight of &lt;2500 g. The primary analysis was performed according to the intent-to-treat principle. The secondary analyses were performed according to the as-treated principle using modified intent-to-treat and per-compliance approaches. The analysis of effect modification by race and ethnicity was planned. A total of 2350 participants were enrolled, with 1176 assigned to group prenatal care and 1174 assigned to individual prenatal care. The study population included 952 Black (40.5%), 502 Hispanic (21.4%), 863 White (36.8%), and 31 ""other races or ethnicity"" (1.3%) participants. Group prenatal care did not reduce the rate of preterm birth (10.4% vs 8.7%; odds ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.63; P=.17) or low birthweight (9.6% vs 8.9%; odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-1.45; P=.62) compared with individual prenatal care. In subgroup analysis, greater attendance in prenatal care was associated with lower rates of preterm birth and low birthweight. This effect was most noticeable for the rates of low birthweight for Black participants in group care: intent to treat (51/409 [12.5%]), modified intent to treat (36/313 [11.5%]), and per compliance (20/240 [8.3%]). Although the rates of low birthweight were significantly higher for Black participants than White participants seen in individual care (adjusted odds ratio, 2.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-3.50), the difference was not significant for Black participants in group care compared with their White counterparts (adjusted odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-3.34). There was no difference in the overall rates of preterm birth or low birthweight between group and individual prenatal care. With increased participation in group prenatal care, lower rates of preterm birth and low birthweight for Black participants were observed. The role of group care models in reducing racial disparities in these birth outcomes requires further study.","CenteringPregnancy; group prenatal care; health disparities; low birthweight; prenatal care; preterm birth; racial equity; Pregnancy; Female; United States; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Premature Birth; Prenatal Care; Birth Weight; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Hispanic or Latino",To test whether participation in group prenatal care would reduce the rates of preterm birth and low birthweight compared with individual prenatal care and whether group prenatal care would reduce the racial disparity in these rates between Black and White patients,SC,2016,2020,RCT,single institution EHR,Black,952,Hispanic,502,White,863,Other races or ethnicity,31,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

This population-based cohort study used U.S. vital statistics data (2015-2019) to evaluate low-risk, nulliparous patients with nonanomalous singletons who labored and delivered at 37-41 weeks of gestation. The primary outcome was the primary cesarean delivery rate. Secondary outcomes included composite neonatal adverse outcome (Apgar score less than 5 at 5 minutes, assisted ventilation for more than 6 hours, seizure, or death), and composite maternal adverse outcome (intensive care unit admission, blood transfusion, uterine rupture, or unplanned hysterectomy), as well as infant death. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to estimate adjusted relative risks (aRR) and 95% CIs. Among 4.3 million births, 60.6% identified as non-Hispanic White, 14.6% identified as non-Hispanic Black, and 24.8% identified as Hispanic. The rate of primary cesarean delivery was 18.5% (n=804,155). An increased risk for cesarean delivery was found in non-Hispanic Black (21.7%, aRR 1.24, 95% CI 1.23-1.25) and Hispanic (17.3%, aRR 1.09, 95% CI 1.09-1.10) individuals, compared with non-Hispanic White individuals (18.1%) after multivariable adjustment. There was an upward trend in the rate of primary cesarean delivery in all racial and ethnic groups ( P for linear trend&amp;lt;0.001 for all groups). However, the racial and ethnic disparity in the rate of primary cesarean delivery remained stable during the study period. The composite neonatal adverse outcome was lower in Hispanic individuals in all newborns (10.7 vs 8.3 per 1,000 live births, aRR 0.74, 95% CI 0.72-0.75), and in newborns delivered by primary cesarean delivery (18.5 vs 15.0 per 1,000 live births, aRR 0.73, 95% CI 0.70-0.76), compared with non-Hispanic White individuals. Using a nationally representative sample in the United States, we found racial and ethnic disparities in the primary cesarean delivery rate in low-risk nulliparous patients, which persisted throughout the study period.","Humans; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy; Infant; Female; United States; Ethnicity; Cohort Studies; Risk; Retrospective Studies; Parity","To compare trend of primary cesarean delivery rate and composite neonatal and maternal adverse outcomes in low-risk pregnancies among racial and ethnic groups: non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic",USA,2015,2019,Retrospective cohort,"US vital statistics period-linked, birth-infant death data",Non-Hispanic White,2634378,Non-Hispanic Black,635418,Hispanic,1079754,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Black women are less likely than their non-Black counterparts to have minimally invasive surgery. This study aimed to assess the trends in surgical approach among women who underwent minimally invasive myomectomies for uterine leiomyomas within a large integrated healthcare system as initiatives were implemented to encourage minimally invasive surgery, particularly evaluating differences in the proportion of minimally invasive surgery performed in Black vs non-Black women. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of women, aged &#x2265;18 years, who underwent a myomectomy for a uterine leiomyoma within Kaiser Permanente Northern California between 2009 and 2019. Generalized estimating equations and Cochran-Armitage testing were used to assess myomectomy incidence and linear trend in the proportions of myomectomy by surgical route-abdominal myomectomy and minimally invasive myomectomy. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the associations between surgical route and (1) race and ethnicity and (2) complications, controlling for patient demographic, clinical, and surgical characteristics. A total of 4033 adult women underwent a myomectomy during the study period. Myomectomy incidence doubled from 0.12 (95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.13) per 1000 women in 2009 to 0.25 (95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.25) per 1000 women in 2019 (P&lt;.001). During the 11-year study period, the proportion of minimally invasive myomectomy increased from 6.0% to 89.5% (a 15-fold increase). The proportion of minimally invasive myomectomy in Black women remained lower than in non-Black women (54.5% vs 64.7%; P&lt;.001). Black women undergoing myomectomy were younger (36.4&#xb1;5.6 vs 37.4&#xb1;5.8 years; P&lt;.001), had a higher mean fibroid weight (436.0&#xb1;505.0 vs 324.7&#xb1;346.1 g; P&lt;.001), and had a higher mean body mass index (30.8&#xb1;7.3 vs 26.6&#xb1;5.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; P&lt;.001) than their non-Black counterparts. In addition to patient race, surgery performed between 2016 and 2019 compared with surgery performed between 2009 and 2012 and higher surgeon volume compared with low surgeon volume were associated with an increased proportion of minimally invasive myomectomy (adjusted relative risks, 12.58 [95% confidence interval, 9.96-15.90] and 6.63 [95% confidence interval, 5.35-8.21], respectively). Black race and fibroid weight of &gt;500 g each independently conferred lower rates of minimally invasive myomectomy. In addition, there was an interaction between race and fibroid weight such that Black women with a fibroid weight of &#x2264;500 g or &gt;500 g were both less likely to have minimally invasive myomectomy than non-Black women with a fibroid weight of &#x2264;500 g (adjusted relative risks, 0.74 [95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.95] and 0.26 [95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.36], respectively). Operative, perioperative, and medical complications were low during the 11-year study period. In regression analyses, after controlling for race, age, fibroid weight, parity, low-income residence, body mass index, surgeon volume, and year of myomectomy, the risk of complications was not markedly different comparing abdominal myomectomy with minimally invasive myomectomy. Similar results were found comparing laparoscopic minimally invasive myomectomy with robotic-assisted minimally invasive myomectomy except for women who underwent laparoscopic minimally invasive myomectomy had a lower risk of experiencing any medical complications than those who underwent robotic-assisted minimally invasive myomectomy (adjusted relative risk, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.83; P=.02). Within an integrated healthcare delivery system, although initiatives to encourage minimally invasive surgery were associated with a marked increase in the proportion of minimally invasive myomectomy, Black women continued to be less likely to undergo minimally invasive myomectomy than their non-Black counterparts. Race and fibroid weight alone did not explain the disparities in minimally invasive myomectomy.","fibroids; minimally invasive myomectomy; open myomectomy; racial differences; surgeon volume; uterine leiomyomas; Adolescent; Adult; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Female; Humans; Laparoscopy; Leiomyoma; Pregnancy; Retrospective Studies; Uterine Myomectomy; Uterine Neoplasms","To assess the trends in surgical approach among women who underwent minimally invasive myomectomies for uterine leiomyomas within a large integrated healthcare system as initiatives were implemented to encourage minimally invasive surgery, particularly evaluating differences in the proportion of minimally invasive surgery performed in Black vs non-Black women",CA,2009,2019,Retrospective cohort,single institution EHR,Non-Hispanic White,1027,Hispanic,714,Black,1124,Asian or Pacific Islander,920,Other,248,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Reproductive racism across the life course included subthemes of early sexualization of Black women, heightened awareness of reproductive health inequities, and knowledge of reproductive oppression. Anti-Black racism in the reproductive health care system included subthemes of absence of shared decision making; vicarious reproductive health experiences; stereotyping, invalidation, and dismissal by reproductive health professionals; and medical mistrust. Participants guarded themselves against racism within reproductive health care by engaging in a variety of self-protective actions including seeking a health care professional of color, overpreparing for their appointments, enlisting advocates, seeking care only when desperate, and heightening symptoms to be heard.

The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried to identify stage II-IVA cervical cancer patients diagnosed in the United States between 2004 and 2015 who were treated with definitive chemoradiation therapy. We defined standard of care (SOC) treatment as receiving external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and concurrent chemotherapy, brachytherapy (BT), and completing treatment within 8&#xa0;weeks, and compared SOC treatment to non-SOC. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). We also evaluated the effect of sociodemographic and clinical variables on receiving SOC. We identified 10,172 women with locally advanced cervical cancer primarily treated with chemotherapy and concurrent EBRT of which 6047 (59.4%) patients received brachytherapy, and only 2978 (29.3%) completed treatment within 8&#xa0;weeks (SOC). Receipt of SOC was associated with significantly improved overall survival (median OS 131.0 mos vs 95.5 mos, 78.1 mos, 49.2 mos; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.0001).

However, in endometrial cancer, quantitative data to support this hypothesis is mixed. Factors that cuase delay prior to clinical presentation are present among Black women, however the whether and how they present among White women, and thus how they may drive racial disparity is unknown. In this qualitative study, from June 2019 to March 2020, we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews among 17 White women with EC (34-73&#xa0;years), living in the Northwest (11), West (2), Midwest (1), Southwest (1), and Northeast (2) U.S. regions, including six with high-risk and/or advanced stage endometrial cancer. An exploratory and descriptive content analysis was performed using iterative rounds of inductive coding, case summaries, and additional interviews to confirm emergent themes, followed by synthetic analysis of themes from a prior qualitative study conducted among Black women, which we analyzed for overlap and distinctions. There were critical points of overlap and distinction between Black and White women in four delay factors identified: menopause and endometrial cancer knowledge, prior negative healthcare experiences, prior/concurrent reproductive conditions, and healthcare provider response. Conceptualizing the care journey as a circular path demonstrates the potential for accumulation of delay that is dependent on underlying risk. We have identified four areas of vulnerability that are often unrecognized and difficult to assess in quantitative investigations of overall quality and co-occurring disparities in endometrial cancer care. With the addition of epidemiologic risk, we present a unified model of vulnerability to care delay in endometrial cancer that can be applied to future quantitative studies and ongoing clinical care.","Endometrial neoplasms; Gynecologic disease; Health care disparities; Healthcare quality, access, and evaluation; Qualitative research; Racism; Adult; Black or African American; Aged; Endometrial Neoplasms; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Menopause; Middle Aged; Physician-Patient Relations; Qualitative Research; Time-to-Treatment; White People","To understand the nature of whether and how these factors may present among White women, and how they may drive the racial disparity in delay of care for endometrial cancer","WA, CA, MA, MI, NJ, TX",2019,2020,Retrospective cohort,University of Washington,White (or Caucasian),17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

A secret-shopper telephone survey was used to assess participation in pharmacist-prescribed contraception. Geospatial analysis was used to map the distribution of participating pharmacies by population characteristics. Of all operating Class A retail pharmacies in Utah, 127 (27%) were providing pharmacist-prescribed contraception 1 year after implementation of the Utah standing order. Oral contraceptive pills were widely accessible (100%); however, other allowed methods were not (vaginal ring 14%; contraceptive patch 2%). Consultation fees and medication costs varied widely. Participating pharmacies were mainly concentrated in population centers. Assuming access to a personal vehicle, urban areas with a high percentage of Hispanic people (Utah's largest minority race or ethnicity group) have access to a participating pharmacy within a 20-minute driving distance. However, access in rural areas with a high percentage Hispanic or other minority were limited. We identified 235 (40%) census tracts with a high proportion of Utah's residents living below the poverty line or of minority race or ethnicity who also had low access to pharmacist-prescribed contraception. Although the pharmacy-based model is intended to increase access to contraception, practical availability 1 year after the authorization of pharmacist-prescribed contraception in Utah suggests that this service does not adequately serve rural areas, particularly rural areas with a high proportion of minorities and those living below the federal poverty line.",Adolescent; Adult; Contraception; Drug Costs; Female; Health Plan Implementation; Health Services Accessibility; Hispanic or Latino; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pharmaceutical Services; Pharmacies; Pharmacists; Pharmacy; Poverty; Referral and Consultation; Rural Population; Utah; Young Adult,To assess pharmacy participation in and accessibility of pharmacist-prescribed contraception after legislation effective in the state of Utah in 2019,UT,2020,2020,Cross-sectional,Utah Health Department,Hispanic,-99,Native American,-99,Black,-99,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, gender and racial biases in obstetrics and gynecology residency letters of recommendation are understudied. This study aimed to determine whether there are differences in the letters of recommendation written for medical students applying for obstetrics and gynecology residency based on applicant gender and underrepresented in medicine status. We analyzed all letters of recommendation submitted to a single obstetrics and gynecology residency program during the 2019-2020 application cycle using a computerized text analysis software to evaluate the presence of 25 word categories. Multivariable regression was used to compare differences in the frequency of word categories by gender and underrepresented in medicine status. Concurrently, we performed a qualitative content analysis of letters from a random sample of applicants balanced for gender and underrepresented in medicine status and explored emerging themes until thematic saturation was reached. We analyzed 3060 letters written for 834 applicants, 721 (87%) of whom were women and 198 (24%) of whom were underrepresented in medicine. Men authored 1605 letters (53%). There was no difference in word categories used in letters written for men and women applicants on multivariable analysis. Similarly, there was no word category difference between letters written for applicants who were underrepresented in medicine compared with White and Asian applicants. However, women letter writers used more communal (relationship-oriented) words compared with men letter writers (P&lt;.001). Moreover, on the qualitative analysis of letters from a random sample of 30 applicants, comments about personality traits were frequent in all letters. Comments on surgical skills, work ethic, and leadership were found more in letters for White and Asian applicants, and phrases that were doubt raisers were found more in letters written for underrepresented medicine applicants.

This study aimed to evaluate the differences in surgical approach for apical vaginal prolapse and postoperative complications by race and ethnicity. This is a retrospective cohort study of women undergoing surgical repair for apical vaginal prolapse between 2014 and 2017 using data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they underwent either vaginal colpopexy or abdominal sacrocolpopexy. Abdominal sacrocolpopexy cases were further divided into those performed by laparotomy and those performed by laparoscopy. Multivariable logistic regression models that controlled for age, comorbidities, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification, and concurrent surgery were used to determine whether race and ethnicity are associated with the type of colpopexy (vaginal vs abdominal) or the surgical route of abdominal sacrocolpopexy. Similar models that also controlled for surgical approach were used to assess 30-day complications by race and ethnicity. A total of 22,861 eligible surgical cases were identified, of which 12,337 (54%) were vaginal colpopexy and 10,524 (46%) were abdominal sacrocolpopexy. Among patients who had an abdominal sacrocolpopexy, 2262 (21%) were performed via laparotomy and 8262 (79%) via laparoscopy. The study population was 70% White, 9% Latina, 6% African American, 3% Asian, 0.6% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 0.4% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 11% unknown. In multivariable analysis, Asian and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander women were less likely to undergo abdominal sacrocolpopexy compared with White women (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.99, and odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.82, respectively). Among women who underwent an abdominal sacrocolpopexy, Latina women and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander women were less likely to undergo a laparoscopic approach compared with White women (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.79, and odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.56, respectively). Complication rates also differed by race and ethnicity. After a colpopexy, African American women were more likely to need a blood transfusion (odds ratio, 3.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.95-4.73; P&#x2264;.001) and have a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus (odds ratio, 2.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-5.48; P=.028), but less likely to present with postoperative urinary tract infections (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.96; P=.028) than White women in multivariable regression models. Using the Clavien-Dindo classification system, Latina women had higher odds of developing grade II complications than White women in multivariable models (odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.51; P=.02). There are racial and ethnic differences in the type and route of surgical repair for apical vaginal prolapse. In particular, Latina and Pacific Islander women were less likely to undergo a laparoscopic approach to abdominal sacrocolpopexy compared with White women. Although complications were uncommon, there were several complications including blood transfusions that were higher among African American and Latina women.

Whether Black-White disparities in maternal in-hospital mortality during the delivery hospitalization vary across hospital types (Black-serving vs nonBlack-serving and teaching vs nonteaching) and whether overall maternal mortality differs across hospital types is not known. The aims of this study were to determine whether risk-adjusted Black-White disparities in maternal mortality during the delivery hospitalization vary by hospital types (this is analysis of disparities in mortality within hospital types) and compare risk-adjusted in-hospital maternal mortality among Black-serving and nonBlack-serving teaching and nonteaching hospitals regardless of race (this is an analysis of overall mortality across hospital types). We performed a population-based, retrospective cohort study of 5,679,044 deliveries among Black (14.2%) and White patients (85.8%) in 3 states (California, Missouri, and Pennsylvania) from 1995 to 2009. A hospital discharge disposition of ""death"" defined maternal in-hospital mortality. Black-serving hospitals had at least 7% Black obstetrical patients (top quartile). We performed risk adjustment by calculating expected death rates using predictions from logistic regression models incorporating sociodemographics, rurality, comorbidities, multiple gestations, gestational age at delivery, year, state, and mode of delivery. We calculated risk-adjusted risk ratios of mortality by comparing observed-to-expected ratios among Black and White patients within hospital types and then examined mortality across hospital types, regardless of patient race. We quantified the proportion of Black-White disparities in mortality attributable to delivering in Black-serving hospitals using causal mediation analysis. There were 330 maternal deaths among 5,679,044 patients (5.8 per 100,000). Black patients died more often (11.5 per 100,000) than White patients (4.8 per 100,000) (relative risk, 2.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.89-2.98). Examination of Black-White disparities revealed that after risk adjustment, Black patients had significantly greater risk of death (adjusted relative risk, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.79) and that the disparity was similar within each of the hospital types. Comparison of mortality, regardless of race, across hospital types revealed that among teaching hospitals, mortality was similar in Black-serving and nonBlack-serving hospitals. However, among nonteaching hospitals, mortality was significantly higher in Black-serving vs nonBlack-serving hospitals (adjusted relative risk, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.87). Notably, 53% of Black patients delivered in nonteaching, Black-serving hospitals compared with just 19% of White patients. Among nonteaching hospitals, 47% of Black-White disparities in maternal in-hospital mortality were attributable to delivering at Black-serving hospitals. Maternal in-hospital mortality during the delivery hospitalization among Black patients is more than double that of White patients. Our data suggest this disparity is caused by excess mortality among Black patients within each hospital type, in addition to excess mortality in nonteaching, Black-serving hospitals where most Black patients deliver. Addressing downstream effects of racism to achieve equity in maternal in-hospital mortality will require transparent reporting of quality metrics by race to reduce differential care and outcomes within hospital types, improvements in care delivery at Black-serving hospitals, overcoming barriers to accessing high-quality care among Black patients, and eventually desegregation of healthcare.","cohort study; health equity; health services; inpatient mortality; maternal morbidity; maternal mortality; population study; pregnancy; racial disparities; racism; Adult; Black or African American; Cohort Studies; Delivery, Obstetric; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Hospital Mortality; Hospitals; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Maternal Mortality; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Retrospective Studies; United States; White People",To determine whether risk-adjusted Black-White disparities in maternal mortality during the delivery hospitalization vary by hospital types (this is analysis of disparities in mortality within hospital types) and compare risk-adjusted in-hospital maternal mortality among Black-serving and nonBlack-serving teaching and nonteaching hospitals regardless of race (this is an analysis of overall mortality across hospital types),"CA, MO, PA",1995,2009,Retrospective cohort,linked birth certificate and hospital discharge data,White,4843924,Black,835120,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

We conducted a secondary analysis of a randomized trial of expectant management compared with induction of labor in low-risk nulliparous people at term. The primary outcome was cesarean birth. Secondary outcome was maternal morbidity, defined as: transfusion of 4 or more units of red blood cells, any transfusion of other products, postpartum infection, intensive care unit admission, hysterectomy, venous thromboembolism, or maternal death. Multivariable modified Poisson regression was used to evaluate associations between race and ethnicity, cesarean birth, and maternal morbidity. Indication for cesarean birth was assessed using multivariable multinomial logistic regression. A mediation model was used to estimate the portion of maternal morbidity attributable to cesarean birth by race and ethnicity. Of 5,759 included participants, 1,158 (20.1%) underwent cesarean birth; 1,404 (24.3%) identified as non-Hispanic Black, 1,670 (29.0%) as Hispanic, and 2,685 (46.6%) as non-Hispanic White.

Research has shown that insurance mandates are not enough to ensure equal access. Many workplaces, schools, and medical education programs have made efforts in recent years to improve the cultural humility of providers in efforts to engage more racially and economically underrepresented groups in medical care. However, these efforts have not been assessed on a population of patients receiving fertility care, an experience that is uniquely shaped by individual social, cultural, and economic factors. This study aimed to better understand the racial, cultural, economic, and religious factors that impact patient experiences obtaining fertility care. A cross-sectional self-administered survey was administered at an academic fertility center in Chicago, Illinois. Of 5000 consecutive fertility care patients, 1460 completed the survey and were included in the study sample. No interventions were used. Descriptive univariate frequencies and percentages were calculated to summarize sociodemographic and other relevant patient characteristics (eg, race or ethnicity, age, household income, religious affiliation, insurance coverage). Rates of endorsing perceived physician cultural competency were compared among demographic subgroups using Pearson chi-squared tests with 2-sided P&lt;.05 indicative of statistical significance. To identify the key determinants of patient-reported worry regarding 9 different fertility treatment outcomes and related concerns, a series of multiple logistic regression models were fit to examine factors associated with patient report of being ""very worried"" or ""extremely worried."" Members of our sample (N=1460) were between 20 and 58 years of age (meanadjusted, 36.2; standard deviation, 4.4). Among Black participants, 42.3% reported that their physician does not understand their cultural background compared with 16.5% of White participants (P&lt;.0001). Participants who identified as Latinx were significantly more likely than White participants to report being very/extremely worried about side effects of treatment, a miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, and birth defects (P&lt;.05, P=.02, P=.002, P=.001, respectively). Individuals who identify as Hindu were nearly 4 times more likely to report being very/extremely worried about experiencing an ectopic pregnancy than nonreligious participants (P&lt;.0002). Respondents most strongly identified the biology or physiology of the couple (meanadjusted, 21.6; confidence interval, 20.4-22.7) and timing or age (meanadjusted, 27.8; confidence interval, 26.5-29.1) as being associated with fertility. Overall, respondents most strongly disagreed that the ability to bear children rests upon God's will (meanadjusted, 65.4; confidence interval, 63.7-67.1), which differed most significantly by race (P&lt;.0001) and religion (P&lt;.0001). Of the patient characteristics investigated, racial and ethnic subgroups showed the greatest degree of variation in regard to worries and concerns surrounding the experience of fertility treatment.

Rates of missed appointments did not differ between the cohorts, but the prepandemic cohort vs. the pandemic cohort was more likely to no-show (49.4% vs. 27.8%) and less likely to cancel (50.6% vs. 72.2%). African American patients, compared with all other patients, during the pandemic were less likely to use telehealth (57.0% vs. 66.8%). African American patients, compared with all other patients, were less likely to have commercial insurance (prepandemic: 41.2% vs. 75.8%; pandemic: 57.0% vs. 78.6%), present to their scheduled appointment (prepandemic: 52.7% vs. 73.7%; pandemic: 48.1% vs. 74.8%), and cancel vs. no-show (prepandemic: 30.8% vs. 68.2%, pandemic: 64.3% vs. 78.3%).

Retrospective cohort. The study was conducted at an urban medical center in New York from January 2016 to August 2021. All women older than 18 years undergoing their first IUI cycle with an infertility diagnosis were included. Intrauterine insemination after ovarian stimulation. Primary outcomes were intrauterine insemination success rate and duration of infertility before seeking infertility care. The primary outcomes used the Kaplan-Meier estimator to investigate the difference in duration of infertility before specialty consultation and logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of clinical pregnancy among English speakers vs. those with limited English proficiency (LEP) undergoing initial IUI. Secondary outcomes included final IUI outcomes compared by language preference. Adjusted analyses controlled for race/ethnicity. A total of 406 patients were included in this study, of which 86% preferred English, 7.6% preferred Spanish, and 5.2% preferred other. Patients with LEP have longer duration of infertility before seeking infertility care than English-proficient women (mean 4.53 &#xb1; 3.65 years vs. 2.01 &#xb1; 1.58 years). Although clinical pregnancy rate of initial IUI did not significantly vary (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 0.68-12.47 unadjusted and OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 0.67-12.35 adjusted), the cumulative pregnancy rate was significantly higher in English-proficient patients than in LEP patients at the time of final IUI (22.32% vs. 15.38%). This is despite a similar number of total IUIs (2.40 English vs. 2.70 LEP). Additionally, LEP patients were significantly more likely to discontinue care after unsuccessful IUI, instead of proceeding to further fertility treatments such as in&#xa0;vitro fertilization. Limited English proficiency is associated with longer duration of infertility before initiating care as well as poorer IUI outcomes, including lower cumulative pregnancy rate. Further research is needed to assess what clinical and socioeconomic factors are contributing to lower IUI success rates and lower continuation in infertility care in LEP patients.",Intrauterine insemination; disparity; duration of infertility; language preference,To evaluate if language preference influences intrauterine insemination outcomes,NY,2016,2021,Retrospective cohort,single institution ehr,Unavailable,42,White,102,Hispanic,102,Black,101,Asian,55,Other,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Mortality and natality data (2019-2021) were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's WONDER database to estimate pregnancy-related mortality ratios, which correspond to any death during pregnancy or up to 1 year after the end of a pregnancy from causes related to the pregnancy per 100,000 live births. Pregnancy-related mortality ratios were determined from International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes A34, O00-O96, and O98-O99. Overall pregnancy-related mortality ratios were partitioned by whether COVID-19 was listed as a contributory cause, and quarterly estimates were compared between 2019 and 2021.

PYLL up to and including age 75 years were calculated [75 - (age at diagnosis + overall survival)] after stratifying for tumor site. Subgroup comparison was done using nonparametric method Kruskal-Wallis H with post-hoc analysis. Linear regression model was used to calculate every five-year incremental trends. Productivity losses were calculated using mortality data multiplied by age-adjusted estimated total lifetime productivity. Total 304,995 patients were included with 1,472,152.67 PYLL from 1975 to 2017. Median PYLL for cervical cancer (12.58 years) was higher than other gynecologic malignancies (0.83, 6.00, 0.67 and - 0.25 years respectively for uterine, ovarian, vaginal and vulvar cancers). The median PYLL for Non-Hispanic White (NHW) population was lower than women from other racial groups for uterine, ovarian and vulvar cancers.

Given the cost of fertility care, lack of insurance is a barrier to access across all races and ethnicities. This study aimed to determine how state insurance mandates are associated with racial and ethnic disparities in in&#xa0;vitro fertilization utilization and clinical outcomes. This was a cohort study using data from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinical Outcome Reporting System from 2014 to 2019 for autologous in&#xa0;vitro fertilization cycles.

Most (72.9%) of the 1,096,539 cycles from 487,191 women occurred in states without an insurance mandate. Although utilization was higher across all racial and ethnic groups in mandated states, the increase in utilization was greatest for non-Hispanic Asian and non-Hispanic White women.

Few U.S.-based precision oncology trials exist for uterine and cervical cancers, which have a high burden of morbidity and mortality among racial and ethnic minority groups. Failure to equitably enroll patients who belong to racial and ethnic minority groups may perpetuate existing disparities in gynecologic cancer outcomes.","Female; United States; Humans; Ethnicity; Minority Groups; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnic and Racial Minorities; Precision Medicine; Genital Neoplasms, Female; Uterine Neoplasms; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Ovarian Neoplasms",To characterize whether enrollment patterns in precision oncology clinical trials for gynecologic cancers reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of patients with gynecologic cancers in the United States,USA,-99,2022,Cross-sectional,"ClinicalTrials.gov; surveillance, epidemiology, and end results; united states census bureau",Non-Hispanic White,3312,non-hispanic black,269,Asian,102,Hispanic,131,American Indian,23,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The existing process entails monthly reviews of adverse events. Each case is assessed for preventability, harm, and standards of care. The equity-focused process consists of: 1) creation of a standardized health equity checklist; 2) application of the checklist to each gynecologic adverse event beginning on September 1, 2020; 3) collection of event review data in a secure central digital repository; 4) review of the cases to understand apparent causes of the event; 5) exploration of areas for improvement by using standard fields; and 6) identification of specific ideas for change. Within 15 months, 46 safety events were identified by standard criteria. Twenty-four of the cases were deemed preventable. Of the 24, there were 12 cases in which social determinants of health or bias or both social determinants of health and bias were identified playing a role. Diagnostic delays and care delays were attributed to social determinants of health and implicit bias. Our process has mapped areas of infrastructure as well as the need for culture improvement and has also highlighted the need for restorative work on addressing implicit bias and improving approaches to shared decision making.

Although racial disparities in readmission risk following hysterectomy for non-cancerous conditions have been reported, data among women with endometrial cancer are absent. This study evaluates racial differences in readmission risk among women undergoing endometrial cancer-related hysterectomy. In the National Cancer Database, women who underwent surgical management for endometrial cancer from 2004 to 2018 were identified. Readmission and minimally invasive hysterectomy (MIH) proportions were plotted according to year of diagnosis and race/ethnicity. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between readmission risk and epidemiological, facility, tumor, and surgical characteristics. A base model was sequentially adjusted to incorporate significant covariates. There were 350,631 patients included in the study. The proportion of MIH increased among all race/ethnicities over the study period; however, MIH rates were lower among Black women. Readmission proportions were 2.7% among White, 4.2% among Black, 2.9% among Hispanic, 2.4% among Asian, 2.1% among American Indian/Alaska Native, and 3.1% among Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander women. In the fully adjusted model incorporating surgical approach, Black women (OR: 1.20, 95% CI = 1.13, 1.28) and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander women (OR: 1.54, 95% CI = 1.09, 2.18) were more commonly readmitted compared to White women.

Rates of preterm birth have remained unchanged, and racial disparities persist. Although a causal pathway has not yet been defined, it is likely that a multitude of clinical and social risk factors contribute to a pregnant person's risk. State-based public health and provider programmatic partnerships have the potential to improve care during pregnancy and reduce complications, such as preterm birth. In North Carolina, a state-based Medicaid-managed Pregnancy Medical Home Program screens pregnant individuals for psychosocial and medical risk factors and utilizes community-based care management, to offer support to those at highest risk. This study aimed to examine the association between care-management and birth outcomes (low birthweight and preterm birth rates) among high-risk non-Hispanic White and Black pregnant people enrolled in the North Carolina Pregnancy Medical Home. This was a quasi-experimental study of people in the Medicaid-managed North Carolina Pregnancy Medical Home who had singleton pregnancies and who enrolled in the program between January 2016 and December 2017. Black and White pregnant people were included in the analysis if they had singleton pregnancies, were enrolled in the Pregnancy Medical Home, and for whom there were data regarding care management involvement. Preterm birth and low birthweight were chosen as the outcomes of interest. Two different methodologies were used to test the effect of care management on outcomes: Method 1 evaluated the effect of intensive care management (&#x2265;5 face-to-face visits from a care manager) and Method 2 evaluated the effect of the implementation of a specific risk-stratification system. Chi-squared and multivariate logistic regressions were performed as appropriate. From January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017, a total of 3564 singleton pregnancies occurred among non-Hispanic Black and White pregnant Medicaid beneficiaries, who were a part of the Pregnancy Medical Home in North Carolina. White pregnant people comprised 57% and Black pregnant people comprised 43% of the sample. In the Method 1 analysis, intensive care management was significantly associated with reductions in preterm birth and low birthweight among Black and White pregnant people whereas in the Method 2 analysis, the implementation of a risk-stratification score only resulted in a significant reduction among Black pregnant people. In multivariable logistic modeling, race, number of prenatal visits, and intensive care management were all significantly associated with the outcomes of interest. Care management is associated with reductions in preterm birth and low birthweight in the Medicaid-managed Pregnancy Medical Home in North Carolina. This study contributes to a growing body of literature on the role of state-based initiatives in reducing perinatal morbidity. These results are significant as it demonstrates the importance of care coordination and management, in identifying and providing resources for high-risk pregnant people. In the United States, where pregnancy-related outcomes are poor, programs that address the multitude of economic, social, and clinical complexities are becoming increasingly crucial and necessary.","disparities; maternal and child health; maternal health policy; preterm birth prevention; social determinants of health; Birth Weight; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Medicaid; North Carolina; Patient-Centered Care; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; United States",to examine the association between care-management and birth outcomes (low birthweight and preterm birth rates) among high-risk non-Hispanic White and Black pregnant people enrolled in the North Carolina Pregnancy Medical Home,NC,2016,2017,RCT,North Carolina Pregnancy Medical Home,Black,1539,White,2029,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Potential biological causes for this disparity include a higher prevalence of obesity and more lethal histologic/molecular subtypes. We hypothesize that another biological factor driving this racial disparity could be the EC microbiome. Banked tumor specimens of postmenopausal, Black and White women undergoing hysterectomy for early stage endometrioid EC were identified. The microbiota of the tumors were characterized by bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing. The microbial component of endometrioid ECs in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were assessed for comparison. 95 early stage ECs were evaluated: 23 Black (24%) and 72 White (76%). Microbial diversity was increased (p &lt; 0.001), and Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria and OD1 phyla abundance was higher in tumors from Black versus White women (p &lt; 0.001). Genus level abundance of Dietzia and Geobacillus were found to be lower in tumors of obese Black versus obese White women (p &lt; 0.001). Analysis of early stage ECs in TCGA found that microbial diversity was higher in ECs from Black versus White women (p &lt; 0.05). When comparing ECs from obese Black versus obese White women, 5 bacteria distributions were distinct, with higher abundance of Lactobacillus acidophilus in ECs from Black women being the most striking difference. Similarly in TCGA, Dietzia and Geobacillus were more common in ECs from White women compared to Black. Increased microbial diversity and the distinct microbial profiles between ECs of obese Black versus obese White women suggests that intra-tumoral bacteria may contribute to EC disparities and pathogenesis.","Endometrial cancer; Race disparities; Uterine microbiome; Carcinoma, Endometrioid; Endometrial Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Obesity; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; White People",to evaluate the microbiota of early stage ECs and assess for variations by race as well as obesity status,NC,2012,2019,Retrospective cohort,single institution ehr,Black,23,White,72,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Given known racial disparities in outcomes in gynecologic oncology, the purpose of this study was to compare differences in ERAS implementation and outcomes by race. A cohort study was performed among gynecologic oncology patients enrolled in an ERAS pathway at one academic institution from March 2017 to December 2021. Compliance with ERAS metrics, postoperative complications, 30-day survival, reoperations, intensive care unit (ICU) transfers, and readmissions within 30 days were compared by race. Of 1083 patients (17.0% non-white), non-white women were younger (54.2 years &#xb1;13.1 vs. 60.7 years &#xb1;13.6, p &lt; 0.001) and proportionally fewer spoke English (75.0% vs. 97.8%, p &lt; 0.001). Fewer non-white women received preadmission ERAS education (73.4% vs. 79.9%, p = 0.05). There were no differences in ERAS implementation by race, including similar rates of preoperative nutritional assessment, carbohydrate loading, antibiotic and thrombosis prophylaxis, and unplanned surgeries by race. There were no differences in complications, reoperations, ICU transfers, or readmissions by race on univariate and multivariate analysis. Four non-white (2.2%) and two white women (0.2%, p = 0.009) died within 30 days of surgery. Fewer non-white women received preadmission education, possibly due to language barriers. ERAS compliance, postoperative complications, readmissions, reoperations, and ICU transfers did not differ by race. There were two additional deaths within 30 days postoperatively among non-white women compared to white women - which is difficult to interpret given the rarity of perioperative mortality - but appeared unlikely to be related to differences in ERAS protocol implementation. ERAS programs should ensure educational materials are translated into various languages and audit metrics by race to ensure equitable outcomes.","Disparities; Enhanced recovery after surgery; Gynecologic oncology; Race; Racial differences; Humans; Female; Enhanced Recovery After Surgery; Cohort Studies; Genital Neoplasms, Female; Gynecologic Surgical Procedures; Postoperative Complications; Length of Stay",To compare differences in ERAS implementation and outcomes by race.,MA,2017,2021,Prospective cohort,enhanced recovery after surgery interactive audit system database,Non-White,184,White,899,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We performed a pooled, cross-sectional analysis of survey data from 154,992 postpartum individuals in 43 states and two jurisdictions that participated in the 2016-2019 PRAMS (Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System). We calculated unadjusted estimates of insurance coverage (Medicaid, commercial, or uninsured) during three periods (prepregnancy, birth, and postpartum), as well as insurance continuity across these periods among rural and urban U.S. residents. We conducted subgroup analyses to compare uninsurance rates among rural and urban residents by sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. We used logistic regression models to generate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for each comparison. Rural residents experienced greater odds of uninsurance in each period and continuous uninsurance across all three periods, compared with their urban counterparts. Uninsurance was higher among rural residents compared with urban residents during prepregnancy (15.4% vs 12.1%; aOR 1.19, 95% CI 1.11-1.28], at birth (4.6% vs 2.8%; aOR 1.60, 95% CI 1.41-1.82), and postpartum (12.7% vs 9.8%, aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.17-1.38]. In each period, rural residents who were non-Hispanic White, married, and with intended pregnancies experienced greater adjusted odds of uninsurance compared with their urban counterparts. Rural-urban differences in uninsurance persisted across both Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states, and among those with varying levels of education and income. Rural inequities in perinatal coverage were experienced by Hispanic, English-speaking, and Indigenous individuals during prepregnancy and at birth. Perinatal uninsurance disproportionately affects rural residents, compared with urban residents, in the 43 states examined.

Between 2012-2018, individuals with T1b vulvar squamous cell carcinoma were identified using the National Cancer Database. Patient, facility, and disease characteristics were compared between patients undergoing SLNB or inguinofemoral lymph node dissection (IFLD). Multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for patient, facility, and disease characteristics, was used to evaluate factors associated with SLNB. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using log rank test and Cox regression was performed. Of the 3,532 patients, 2,406 (68.1%) underwent lymph node evaluation, with 1,704 (48.2%) undergoing IFLD and 702 (19.8%) SLNB. In a multivariable analysis, treatment at minority-serving hospitals (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19-0.78) and low-volume hospitals (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28-0.70) were associated with significantly lower odds of undergoing SLNB compared to receiving care at non-minority-serving and high-volume hospitals, respectively. While SLNB utilization increased over time for the entire cohort and stratified subgroups, use of the procedure did not increase at minority-serving hospitals.

Examination of programs that affect these outcomes for women at high risk, including disparate populations, is needed. This study aimed to examine whether a postpartum navigation program decreases all-cause 30-day postpartum hospitalizations and hospitalizations because of severe maternal morbidity identified using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. The effect of this program was explored across patient demographics, including race and ethnicity. This was a retrospective cohort study that used health records of women who delivered at 3 large hospitals in the New York metropolitan area (Queens and Long Island) between April 2020 and November 2021 and who were at high risk of severe maternal morbidity. The incidence rates of 30-day postpartum all-cause hospitalization and hospitalization because of severe maternal morbidity were compared between women who were and were not enrolled in a novel postpartum transitional care management program. Navigation included standardized assessments, development of care plans, clinical management, and connection to clinical and social services that would extend beyond the postpartum period. Because the program prioritized enrolling women of the greatest risk, the risk-adjusted incidence was estimated using multivariate Poisson regression and stratified across patient demographics. Patient health records of 5819 women were included for analysis. Of note, 5819 of 19,258 deliveries (30.2%) during the study period were identified as having a higher risk of severe maternal morbidity. This was consistent with the incidence of high-risk pregnancies for tertiary hospitals in the New York metropolitan area. The condition most identified for risk of severe maternal morbidity at the time of delivery was hypertension (3171/5819 [54.5%]). The adjusted incidence of all-cause rehospitalization was 20% lower in enrollees than in nonenrollees (incident rate ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.95). Rehospitalization was decreased the most among Black women (incident rate ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.80). The adjusted incidence of rehospitalization because of indicators of severe maternal morbidity was 56% lower in enrollees than in nonenrollees (incident rate ratio, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.77). Furthermore, it decreased most among Black women (incident rate ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.73). High-risk medical conditions at the time of delivery increased the risk of postpartum hospitalization, including hospitalizations because of severe maternal morbidity. A postpartum navigation program designed to identify and resolve clinical and social needs reduced postpartum hospitalizations and racial disparities with hospitalizations. Hospitals and healthcare systems should adopt this type of care model for women at high risk of severe maternal morbidity. Cost analyses are needed to evaluate the financial effect of postpartum navigation programs for women at high risk of severe maternal morbidity or mortality, which could influence reimbursement for these types of services.

Pap smear screening and HPV vaccination are powerful tools to prevent cervical cancer. We evaluated the utilization of these tools among AI/ANs living in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). The Indian Health Service (IHS) National Data Warehouse's Epi Data Mart was analyzed using all healthcare visits from 2010 to 2020 from IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian clinics in the PNW. Women ages 21-64 were included and considered up-to-date on pap smears if they had either cytology within 3 years or cytology with HPV testing within 5 years of the most recent clinical encounter. HPV vaccination rates for both sexes were calculated for individuals ages 9-26. HPV vaccination was considered complete if: two vaccines were received prior to age 15 or after three vaccinations if initiated after age 15. Cervical cancer screening rates are below the national average of 73.5% ranging between 57.1% - 65.0%. Sub-analysis of age groups shows substantially lower rates of up-to-date pap smear screening in the 50-64 age group. HPV vaccination rates have increased over time for both sexes across all age groups. However, the current vaccination rate of 58.6% is well below the Healthy People 2030 goal of 84.3%. Cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination are the cornerstones of cervical cancer prevention and early detection. These tools are underutilized and public health efforts can be strengthened to improve cervical cancer disparities in AI/AN women.

We included a cross-sectional subset of adult patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer between January 1, 2011, and November 30, 2018, who received frontline treatment and were followed for at least 1 year in a real-world database. The primary outcome was receipt of BRCA testing, classified by biosample source as germline (blood or saliva) or somatic (tissue). Lines of therapy (frontline, second line, third line) were derived based on dates of surgery and chemotherapy. Descriptive statistics were analyzed. Among 2,557 patients, 72.2% (n=1,846) had at least one documented BRCA test. Among tested patients, 62.5% (n=1,154) had only germline testing, 10.6% (n=197) had only somatic testing, and 19.9% (n=368) had both. Most patients had testing before (9.7%, n=276) or during (48.6%, n=1,521) frontline therapy, with 17.6% (n=273) tested during second-line and 12.7% (n=129) tested during third-line therapy. Patients who received BRCA testing, compared with patients without testing, were younger (mean age 63 years vs 66 years, P &amp;lt;.001) and were more likely to be treated at an academic practice (10.4% vs 7.0%, P =.01), with differences by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score ( P &amp;lt;.001), stage of disease ( P &amp;lt;.001), histology ( P &amp;lt;.001), geography ( P &amp;lt;.001), and type of frontline therapy ( P &amp;lt;.001), but no differences based on race or ethnicity. The proportion of patients who received BRCA testing within 1 year of diagnosis increased from 24.6% of patients in 2011 to 75.6% of patients in 2018. In a large cohort of patients with ovarian cancer, significant practice disparities existed in testing for actionable BRCA mutations. Despite increased testing over time, many patients did not receive testing, suggesting missed opportunities to identify patients appropriate for targeted therapy and genetic counseling.","Humans; Adult; Female; Middle Aged; BRCA1 Protein; Cross-Sectional Studies; Genetic Testing; Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial; Ovarian Neoplasms; Germ Cells","To describe the testing rate, patient characteristics, temporal trends, timing, and results of germline and somatic BRCA testing in patients with ovarian cancer using real-world data",USA,2011,2018,Cross-sectional,Flatiron Health Database,Hispanic,183,Non-Hispanic Black,138,Non-Hispanic White,1842,None of the above,266,Unknown,128,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, little is known about racial and ethnic differences in opportunistic salpingectomy adoption. Surgical innovations in gynecology may be adopted differentially across racial and ethnic groups, exacerbating current disparities in quality of care. This study aimed to evaluate racial and ethnic differences in opportunistic salpingectomy adoption across inpatient and outpatient settings and assess the effect of national guidelines supporting opportunistic salpingectomy use on these differences. A sample of 650,905 women aged 18 to 50 years undergoing hysterectomy with ovarian conservation or surgical sterilization from 2011 to 2018 was identified using the Premier Healthcare Database, an all-payer hospital administrative database, including more than 700 hospitals across the United States. The association between race and ethnicity and opportunistic salpingectomy use was examined using multivariable-adjusted mixed-effects log-binomial regression models accounting for hospital-level clustering. Models included race and ethnicity by year of surgery (2011-2013 [before guideline] and 2014-2018 [after guideline]) interaction term to test whether racial and ethnic differences in opportunistic salpingectomy adoption changed with the release of national guidelines supporting opportunistic salpingectomy use. From 2011 to 2018, 82,792 women underwent hysterectomy and opportunistic salpingectomy (non-Hispanic White, 60.3%; non-Hispanic Black, 18.8%; Hispanic, 12.2%; non-Hispanic other race, 8.7%) and 23,398 women underwent opportunistic salpingectomy for sterilization (non-Hispanic White, 64.7%; non-Hispanic Black, 10.8%; Hispanic, 16.7%; non-Hispanic other race, 7.8%). The proportion of hysterectomy procedures involving an opportunistic salpingectomy increased from 6.3% in 2011 to 59.7% in 2018 (9.5-fold increase), and the proportion of sterilization procedures involving an opportunistic salpingectomy increased from 0.7% in 2011 to 19.4% in 2018 (27.7-fold increase). In multivariable-adjusted models, non-Hispanic Black (risk ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-0.97), Hispanic (risk ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.95-1.00), and non-Hispanic other race women (risk ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.90-0.96) were less likely to undergo hysterectomy and opportunistic salpingectomy than non-Hispanic White women. A significant interaction between race and ethnicity and year of surgery was noted in non-Hispanic Black compared with non-Hispanic White women (P&lt;.001), with a reduction in differences in hysterectomy and opportunistic salpingectomy use after national guideline release (risk ratio2011-2013, 0.80 [95% confidence interval, 0.73-0.88]; risk ratio2014-2018, 0.98 [95% confidence interval, 0.95-1.01]). Moreover, non-Hispanic Black women were less likely to undergo an opportunistic salpingectomy for sterilization than non-Hispanic White women (risk ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-0.95), with no difference by year of surgery (P=.62). Stratified analyses by hysterectomy route and age at surgery revealed similar results. Although opportunistic salpingectomy for ovarian cancer prevention has been rapidly adopted in the United States, our findings suggested that its adoption has not been equitable across racial and ethnic groups. Non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic other race women were less likely to undergo opportunistic salpingectomy than non-Hispanic White women even after adjusting for sociodemographic, clinical, procedural, hospital, and provider characteristics. These differences persisted after the release of national guidelines supporting opportunistic salpingectomy use. Future research should focus on understanding the reasons for these differences to inform interventions that promote equity in opportunistic salpingectomy use.",disparities; epidemiology; opportunistic salpingectomy; ovarian cancer prevention; race and ethnicity; racial disparities; risk-reducing surgery; Delivery of Health Care; Ethnicity; Female; Humans; Hysterectomy; Ovarian Neoplasms; Salpingectomy; United States,To evaluate racial and ethnic differences in opportunistic salpingectomy adoption across inpatient and outpatient settings and assess the effect of national guidelines supporting opportunistic salpingectomy use on these differences,USA,2011,2018,Registry,Premier Perspective Healthcare Database,non-Hispanic White,149490,non-Hispanic Black,47563,Hispanic,29911,non-Hispanic other race,20823,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, factors leading to disparate treatment receipt are understudied. We examined whether patient refusal of adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy or radiation) differed between Black and White women and whether treatment refusal mediated racial disparities in survival among women with endometrial cancer. We used the National Cancer Database, a hospital-based cancer registry, to identify non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White women diagnosed with endometrial cancer from 2004 to 2016 who either received or refused recommended radiation or chemotherapy. We used logistic regression to estimate multivariable-adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between race and treatment refusal. We also examined predictors of treatment refusal in race-specific models. Accelerated failure time models were used to estimate absolute differences in overall survival by race. We used causal mediation analysis to estimate the proportion of racial differences in overall survival attributable to racial differences in adjuvant treatment refusal. We considered the overall study population and strata defined by histology, and adjusted for sociodemographic, tumor, and facility characteristics. Our analysis included 75,447 endometrial cancer patients recommended to receive radiation and 60,187 endometrial cancer patients recommended to receive chemotherapy, among which 6.4% and 11.4% refused treatment, respectively. Among Black women recommended for radiation or chemotherapy, 6.4% and 9.6% refused, respectively. Among White women recommended for radiation or chemotherapy, 6.4% and 11.8% refused, respectively. After adjusting for sociodemographic variables, facility characteristics, and tumor characteristics, Black women were more likely to refuse chemotherapy than White women (adjusted odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.37), but no difference in radiation refusal was observed (adjusted odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.11). Some predictors of radiation refusal varied by race, namely income, education, histology, stage, and chemotherapy receipt (P interactions&lt;.05), whereas predictors of chemotherapy refusal were generally similar between Black and White women. Among women recommended for radiation, Black women survived an average of 4.3 years shorter than White women, which did not seem attributable to differences in radiation refusal. Among women recommended for chemotherapy, Black women survived an average of 3.2 years shorter than White women of which 1.9 months (4.9%) could potentially be attributed to differences in chemotherapy refusal. We observed differences in chemotherapy refusal by race, and those differences may be responsible for up to about 2 months of the overall 3.2-year survival disparity between White and Black women. Radiation refusal did not explain any of the 4.3-year disparity among women recommended for radiation. Treatment refusal accounts for, at most, a small fraction of the total racial disparity in endometrial cancer survival. Although a better understanding of the reasons for patient treatment refusal and subsequent intervention may help improve outcomes for some women, other causes of disparate outcomes, particularly those reflecting the social determinants of health, must be investigated.",chemotherapy; disparities; hospital-based cancer registry; race; radiation treatment; uterus neoplasm; Black or African American; Endometrial Neoplasms; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Neoplasm Staging; Treatment Refusal; White People,To examine whether patient refusal of adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy or radiation) differed between Black and White women and whether treatment refusal mediated racial disparities in survival among women with endometrial cancer,USA,2004,2016,Retrospective cohort,National Cancer Database,White,116525,Black,19109,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This retrospective cohort study included pregnant and postpartum people who self-identified as either Black or White, and received prenatal care at academic faculty offices affiliated with an urban quaternary medical center. Individuals were divided into two cohorts to reflect the epochs of implementation. The primary outcome was the frequency of depression screening. The secondary outcome was the frequency of provision of a treatment recommendation for those with a positive depression screen. Antenatal and postpartum care were analyzed separately. A propensity score was used in multivariable models to control for confounders chosen a priori across implementation epoch. Interaction terms were created between race and implementation epoch to identify whether effect modification was present. Subgroup analyses were performed for outcomes with significant race-by-epoch interaction terms. Of the 4,710 individuals included in these analyses, 4,135 (87.8%) self-identified as White and 575 (12.2%) self-identified as Black. Before implementation, Black individuals were more likely to receive screening (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.44) but less likely to have a treatment recommended when a positive screen was identified (aOR 0.05). In multivariable models, race-by-epoch interaction terms were significant for both antenatal screening (P&lt;.001) and antenatal treatment recommendation (P=.045), demonstrating that implementation of the perinatal collaborative care model was associated with reductions in extant racial disparities. After implementation, there were no significant differences by race (referent=White) in screening for antenatal depression (aOR 1.22, 95% CI 0.89-1.68) or treatment recommendations for those who screened positive (aOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.27-1.53). Race-by-epoch interaction terms were not significant in multivariable models for either postpartum screening or treatment recommendation. Implementation of the perinatal collaborative care model is associated with a mitigation of racial disparities in antenatal depression care and may be an equity-promoting intervention for maternal health.","Child; Depression; Depression, Postpartum; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Perinatal Care; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Retrospective Studies",To evaluate whether perinatal collaborative care model implementation was associated with a reduction in racial disparities in depression care.,IL,2015,2019,Retrospective cohort,Electronic Medical Record,White,4135,Black,575,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

We conducted a retrospective cohort of individuals with pregestational diabetes with singleton gestations from 2012 to 2016 at a tertiary care center. Addresses were geocoded using ArcGIS and then linked at the census tract to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2018 SVI (Social Vulnerability Index), which incorporates 15 Census variables to produce a composite score and four scores across thematic domains (socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, minority status and language, and housing type and transportation). Scores range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating greater community-level social vulnerability. The primary outcome was Hb A1c less than 6.0%, and, secondarily, Hb A1c less than 6.5%, in the second or third trimesters. Multivariable Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to evaluate the association between SVI score as a continuous measure and target Hb A1c. Among 418 assessed pregnant individuals (33.0% type 1; 67.0% type 2 diabetes), 41.4% (173/418) achieved Hb A1c less than 6.0%, and 56.7% (237/418) Hb A1c less than 6.5% at a mean gestational age of 29.5 weeks (SD 5.78). Pregnant individuals with a higher SVI score were less likely to achieve Hb A1c less than 6.0% compared with those with a lower SVI score. For each 0.1-unit increase in SVI score, the risk of achieving Hb A1c less than 6.0% decreased by nearly 50% (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 0.53; 95% CI 0.36-0.77), and by more than 30% for Hb A1c less than 6.5% (adjusted odds ratio 0.67; 95% CI 0.51-0.88). With regard to specific SVI domains, those who scored higher on socioeconomic status (aRR 0.50; 95% CI 0.35-0.71) as well as on household composition and disability (aRR 0.55; 95% CI 0.38-0.79) were less likely to achieve Hb A1c less than 6.0%. Pregnant individuals with pregestational diabetes living in an area with higher social vulnerability were less likely to achieve glycemic control, as measured by HgbA1c levels. Interventions are needed to assess whether addressing social determinants of health can improve glycemic control in pregnancy.","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin; Glycemic Control; Humans; Infant; Pregnancy; Pregnancy in Diabetics; Retrospective Studies; Social Vulnerability",To evaluate the association between community-level social vulnerability and achieving glycemic control (defined as hemoglobin A1c [Hb A1c] less than 6.0% or less than 6.5%) among individuals with pregestational diabetes,OH,2012,2016,Retrospective cohort,Single institution ehr,"Hispanic, Latina",24,Non-Hispanic Asian,52,Non-Hispanic White,222,Non-Hispanic Black,120,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

We identified GO by National Provider Identifiers (NPI) and calculated county-level density of GO. County-level gynecologic cancer rates were derived from the U.S. Cancer Statistics to represent demand for GO services. A spatial data plot compared GO workforce to gynecologic cancer service demand. U.S. census county-level demographic information was collected and compared. In 2019, 1527 GO had a registered NPI. Of 3142 counties in the US, 2864 (91.2%) counties had no GO in their local county and 1943 (61.8%) counties had no GO in local or adjacent (neighboring) counties. As the gynecologic cancer rate increases (described in quintiles) in counties, there are fewer counties without a GO or adjacent GO. However, county-level GO density (number of GO per 100,000 women) did not significantly increase as the county-level incidence of gynecologic cancer increased (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.12, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.06)&#x2026; Women living in counties with the highest gynecologic cancer rates and without access to a GO were more likely to reside in a rural area where residents had a lower median income and were predominately of White race.. There are a significant number of counties in the U.S. without a GO. As county-level gynecologic cancer incidence increased, the proportion of counties without a GO decreased; GO density did not increase with increasing cancer rates.

The National Cancer Database was surveyed for patients with uterine, cervical or ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer treated between 2004 and 2017. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to assess associations between clinico-demographic variables and refusal of surgery.

However, the variation and accuracy of provider-assigned Apgar scores across neonatal racial groups have yet to be evaluated. This study aimed to investigate how provider-assigned Apgar scores vary by neonatal race independently of clinical factors and umbilical cord gas values. We conducted a retrospective cohort study at an urban academic medical center. All live births at &#x2265;23 weeks and 0 days of gestation from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 with complete data available were included. Data were queried from the electronic medical record and included race, ethnicity, gestational age of neonate, umbilical cord gas values (umbilical artery pH and base deficit), admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, and presence of maternal-fetal complications. Primary outcome measures were neonates' Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes. Color Apgar score and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit served as secondary outcome measures. We performed 3 partially proportional ordinal regression models controlling for an increasing number of covariates, with Model 1, the baseline model, adjusted for gestational age, Model 2 additionally adjusted for umbilical cord gases, and Model 3 additionally adjusted for maternal medical conditions and pregnancy complications. A total of 977 neonates met selection criteria; 553 (56.6%) were Black. Providers assigned Black neonates significantly lower Apgar scores at 1 minute (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.80) and 5 minutes (odds ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.87), when controlling for umbilical artery gases, gestational age, and maternal-fetal complications. This difference seemed related to significantly lower assigned color Apgar scores at 1 minute when controlling for all the above factors (odds ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.68). Providers admitted full-term Black neonates to the neonatal intensive care unit at higher rates than non-Black neonates when controlling for all factors (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.77). Black neonates did not have more abnormal cord gas values (mean umbilical artery pH of 7.259 for Black vs 7.256 for non-Black neonates), which would have supported their admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Providers applied inaccurate Apgar scores to Black neonates given that the umbilical cord gases were not in agreement with lower Apgar scores. These inaccuracies may be a factor in unnecessary admissions to neonatal intensive care units, and suggest that colorism and racial biases exist among healthcare providers.","Apgar; anti-racist praxis; medical racism; neonatal intensive care unit; obstetrical racism; race; racial bias; umbilical cord gases; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy; Female; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Apgar Score; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Resuscitation; Fetal Blood",to investigate how provider-assigned Apgar scores vary by neonatal race independently of clinical factors and umbilical cord gas values,USA,2019,2019,Retrospective cohort,single institution EHR,Black,553,Non-black,424,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

This retrospective cohort study used the National Cancer Database (NCDB) data from 2004 to 2015 to identify patients with stage II-III ovarian cancer who underwent primary surgery. Multivariate logistic regression analyses evaluated factors associated with notation in the NCDB that ""chemotherapy was not recommended/administered because it was contraindicated due to patient risk factors (i.e., comorbid conditions, advanced age)."" Survival data were assessed via Kaplan-Meier analyses. Of the 48,245 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 522 (1.08%) did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy because it was determined to be contraindicated.

Women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer from 1996 to 2014 were identified through the California Cancer Registry and followed through 2016. Women's geocoded addresses were linked to pollutant exposure data and averaged over the follow-up period. Pollutants were considered independently and in multi-pollutant models. Cox proportional hazards models assessed hazards of disease-specific death due to environmental exposures, controlling for important covariates, with additional models stratified by stage at diagnosis, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. PM2.5 and NO2, but not ozone or DTR, were significantly associated with survival in univariate models. In a multi-pollutant model for PM2.5, ozone, and DTR, an interquartile range increase in PM2.5 (Hazard Ratio [HR], 1.45; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.41-1.49) was associated with worse prognosis. Similarly, in the multi-pollutant model with NO2, ozone, and DTR, women with higher NO2 exposures (HR for 20.0-30.0 ppb, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.25-1.36 and HR for &gt;30.0 ppb, 2.48; 95% CI, 2.32-2.66) had greater mortality compared to the lowest exposed (&lt;20.0 ppb). Stratified results show the effects of the pollutants differed by race/ethnicity and were magnified among women diagnosed in early stages. Our analyses suggest that greater exposure to NO2 and PM2.5 may adversely impact ovarian cancer-specific survival, independent of sociodemographic and treatment factors.

We assessed pregnant women 18-50 years without prior surgery in the preceding 30 days who underwent a nonobstetric surgery. Race and ethnicity were categorized as non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White (reference). The primary outcome was a composite of 30-day major postoperative complications inclusive of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and infectious complications, reoperation, unplanned readmission, blood transfusion, and death. We used modified Poisson regression to estimate the relative risk of complications. Among 3,093 pregnant women, 18% were non-Hispanic Black, 20% Hispanic, and 62% non-Hispanic White. The most common surgeries were appendectomy (36%) and cholecystectomy (19%).

Patients with low SES were more likely to receive no treatment (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.44-2.64) or surgery without chemotherapy (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.38-2.03). Among patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer, African American race, low SES, and treatment by low-volume providers are significant and independent predictors of receiving no surgery, no debulking surgery, no chemotherapy, and nonstandard treatment sequences.","disparities; ovarian cancer; race; socioeconomic status; Adenocarcinoma; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; California; Combined Modality Therapy; Continental Population Groups; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Guideline Adherence; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Logistic Models; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Neoplasm Staging; Ovarian Neoplasms; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Social Class; Survival Analysis; Young Adult","We sought to investigate the impact of race, socioeconomic status (SES), and health care system characteristics on receipt of specific components of National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline care for stage IIIC/IV ovarian cancer.",CA,1996,2006,Retrospective Cohort,California Cancer Registry,White,8509,African American,561,Hispanic,1813,Asian/Pacific Islander,982,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Cardiovascular disease has emerged as the leading cause of pregnancy-related death in the United States. The primary aim of this analysis was to describe the incidence and type of cardiovascular disease as a cause of pregnancy-related mortality in California. The secondary aims were to describe racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities, risk factors, birth outcomes, timing of death and diagnosis, and signs and symptoms of cardiovascular disease and identify contributing factors. The California Pregnancy-Associated Mortality Review retrospectively examined a case series of 64 cardiovascular pregnancy-related deaths from 2002 through 2006. Two cardiologists independently reviewed complete inpatient and outpatient medical records including laboratory, radiology, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, echocardiograms, and autopsy findings for each cardiovascular death and classified cause of death by type of cardiovascular disease. Demographic data, racial disparities, risk factors, signs and symptoms, timing of diagnosis and death, birth outcomes, and contributing factors were analyzed using bivariate comparisons with noncardiovascular pregnancy-related deaths and population-based data. Among 2,741,220 California women who gave birth, 864 died while pregnant or within 1 year of pregnancy; 257 of the deaths were deemed pregnancy related, and of these, 64 (25%) were attributed to cardiovascular disease. There were 42 deaths caused by cardiomyopathy, and the pregnancy-related mortality rate from cardiomyopathy was 1.54 per 100,000 births. Dilated cardiomyopathy existed in 29 cases, of which 15 met the definition of peripartum cardiomyopathy. Women with cardiovascular disease were more likely than women who died from noncardiovascular causes to be African-American (39.1% vs 16.1%; P &lt; .01) and more likely to use illicit substances (23.7% vs 9.4%; P &lt; .01). Thirty-seven percent were obese and 20% had a concomitant diagnosis of hypertension or preeclampsia during pregnancy. Health care decisions in the diagnosis or treatment of cardiovascular disease during and after pregnancy contributed to the fatal outcomes. African-American race, substance use, and obesity were risk factors for pregnancy-related cardiovascular disease mortality. Chronic disease prevention and better recognition and response to cardiovascular disease during pregnancy are needed to reduce maternal mortality.","cardiovascular disease; pregnancy-related mortality; Adult; California; Cardiomyopathies; Female; Humans; Incidence; Maternal Mortality; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors","to describe the incidence and type of cardiovascular disease as a cause of pregnancy-related mortality in california. the secondary aims were to describe racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities, risk factors, birth outcomes, timing of death and diagnosis, and signs and symptoms of cardiovascular disease and identify contributing factors",CA,2002,2006,Retrospective Cohort,California Pregnancy-Associated Mortality Review,"White, non-Hispanic",793780,Hispanic,1391656,"African-American, non-Hispanic",146536,All other/unknown or missing,401701,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Similar to racial/ethnic disparities in maternal death, black women are more likely to experience severe maternal morbidity than white women. Site of care has received attention as a mechanism to explain disparities in other areas of medicine. Data indicate that black women receive care in a concentrated set of hospitals and that these hospitals appear to provide lower quality of care. Whether racial differences in the site of delivery contribute to observed black-white disparities in severe maternal morbidity rates is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether hospitals with high proportions of black deliveries have higher severe maternal morbidity and whether such differences contribute to overall black-white disparities in severe maternal morbidity. We used a published algorithm to identify cases of severe maternal morbidity during deliveries in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project for 2010 and 2011. We ranked hospitals by their proportion of black deliveries into high black-serving (top 5%), medium black-serving (5% to 25% range), and low black-serving hospitals. We analyzed the risks of severe maternal morbidity for black and white women by hospital black-serving status using logistic regressions that were adjusted for patient characteristics, comorbidities, hospital characteristics, and within-hospital clustering. We then derived adjusted rates from these models. Seventy-four percent of black deliveries occurred at high and medium black-serving hospitals. Overall, severe maternal morbidity occurred more frequently among black than white women (25.8 vs 11.8 per 1000 deliveries, respectively; P &lt; .001); after adjustment for the distribution of patient characteristics and comorbidities, this differential declined but remained elevated (18.8 vs 13.3 per 1000 deliveries, respectively; P &lt; .001). Women who delivered in high and medium black-serving hospitals had elevated rates of severe maternal morbidity rates compared with those in low black-serving hospitals in unadjusted (29.4 and 19.4 vs 12.2 per 1000 deliveries, respectively; P &lt; .001) and adjusted analyses (17.3 and 16.5 vs 13.5 per 1000 deliveries, respectively; P &lt; .001). Black women who delivered at high black-serving hospitals had the highest risk of poor outcomes. Most black deliveries occur in a concentrated set of hospitals, and these hospitals have higher severe maternal morbidity rates. Targeting quality improvement efforts at these hospitals may improve care for all deliveries and disproportionately impact care for black women.","disparities; obstetrics; quality of care; severe maternal morbidity; Adult; African Americans; Comorbidity; Delivery, Obstetric; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Hospitals; Humans; Middle Aged; Obstetric Labor Complications; Pregnancy; Severity of Illness Index; United States; Young Adult",to determine whether hospitals with high proportions of black deliveries have higher severe maternal morbidity and whether such differences contribute to overall black-white disparities in severe maternal morbidity,USA,2010,2011,Retrospective Cohort,nationwide inpatient sample of the Healthcare cost and utilization project,White,3584639,Black,1024652,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

With national organizations now including an assessment of incontinence as a quality performance measure, providers and health care organizations have a growing incentive to identify and engage these women who are undiagnosed and untreated. We sought to identify clinical and sociodemographic determinants of patient-provider discussion and treatment of incontinence among ethnically diverse, community-dwelling women. We conducted an observational cohort study from 2003 through 2012 of 969 women aged 40 years and older enrolled in a Northern California integrated health care delivery system who reported at least weekly incontinence. Clinical severity, type, treatment, and discussion of incontinence were assessed by structured questionnaires. Multivariable regression evaluated predictors of discussion and treatment. Mean age of the 969 participants was 59.9 (Â±9.7) years, and 55% were racial/ethnic minorities (171 black, 233 Latina, 133 Asian or Native American). Fifty-five percent reported discussing their incontinence with a health care provider, 36% within 1 year of symptom onset, and with only 3% indicating that their provider initiated the discussion. More than half (52%) reported being at least moderately bothered by their incontinence. Of these women, 324 (65%) discussed their incontinence with a clinician, with 200 (40%) doing so within 1 year of symptom onset. In a multivariable analysis, women were less likely to have discussed their incontinence if they had a household income &lt; $30,000/y vs â‰¥ $120,000/y (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-0.86) or were diabetic (AOR, 0.71, 95% CI, 0.51-0.99). They were more likely to have discussed incontinence if they had clinically severe incontinence (AOR, 3.09, 95% CI, 1.89-5.07), depression (AOR, 1.71, 95% CI, 1.20-2.44), pelvic organ prolapse (AOR, 1.98, 95% CI, 1.13-3.46), or arthritis (AOR, 1.44, 95% CI, 1.06-1.95). Among the subset of women reporting at least moderate subjective bother from incontinence, black race (AOR, 0.45, 95% CI, 0.25-0.81, vs white race) and income &lt; $30,000/y (AOR, 0.37, 95% CI, 0.17-0.81, vs â‰¥ $120,000/y) were associated with a reduced likelihood of discussing incontinence. Those with clinically severe incontinence (AOR, 2.93, 95% CI, 1.53-5.61, vs low to moderate incontinence by the Sandvik scale) were more likely to discuss it with a clinician. Even in an integrated health care system, lower income was associated with decreased rates of patient-provider discussion of incontinence among women with at least weekly incontinence. Despite being at increased risk of incontinence, diabetic women were also less likely to have discussed incontinence or received care. Findings provide support for systematic screening of women to overcome barriers to evaluation and treatment.","comorbidity; health care delivery; socioeconomic factors; urinary incontinence; women; African Americans; Aged; Arthritis; California; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Depression; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Pelvic Organ Prolapse; Poverty; Severity of Illness Index; Urinary Incontinence; Urinary Incontinence, Stress; Urinary Incontinence, Urge","to identify clinical and sociodemographic determinants of patient-provider discussion and treatment of incontinence among ethnically diverse, community-dwelling women",CA,2003,2012,Retrospective Cohort,Kaiser Permanente Northern California,Non-Latina white,432,Black,171,Latina white,233,Asian,133,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The objective of the study was to quantify racial differences in previable birth and their contribution to infant mortality and to estimate the relative influence of factors associated with live birth occurring before the threshold of viability. This was a population-based retrospective cohort of all live births in Ohio over a 7 year period, 2006-2012. Demographic, pregnancy, and delivery characteristics of previable live births at 16 0/7 to 22 6/7 weeks of gestation were compared with a referent group of live births at 37 0/7 to 42 6/7 weeks. Rates of birth at each week of gestation were compared between black and white mothers, and relative risk ratios were calculated. Logistic regression estimated the relative risk of factors associated with previable birth, with adjustment for concomitant risk factors. Of 1,034,552 live births in Ohio during the study period, 2607 (0.25% of all live births) occurred during the previable period of 16-22 weeks. There is a significant racial disparity in the rate and relative risk of previable birth, with a 3- to 6-fold relative risk increase in black mothers at each week of previable gestational age. The incidence of previable birth for white mothers was 1.8 per 1000 and for black mothers, 6.9 per 1000. Factors most strongly associated with previable birth, presented as adjusted relative risk ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]), were maternal characteristics of black race adjusted relative risk 2.9 (95% CI, 2.6-3.2), age â‰¥ 35 years 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1-1.6), and unmarried 2.1 (95% CI, 1.8-2.3); fetal characteristics including congenital anomaly, 5.4 (95% CI, 3.4-8.1) and genetic disorder, 5.1 (95% CI, 2.5-10.1); and pregnancy characteristics including prior preterm birth 4.4 (95% CI, 3.7-5.2) and multifetal gestation, twin, 16.9 (95% CI, 14.4-19.8) or triplet, 65.4 (95% CI, 32.9-130.2). The majority, 80%, of previable births (16-22 weeks) were spontaneous in nature, compared with 73% in early preterm births (23-33 weeks), 72% in late preterm births (34-36 weeks), and 65% of term births (37-42 weeks) (P &lt; .001). Previable births constituted approximately 28% of total infant mortalities in white newborns and 45% of infant mortalities in black infants in Ohio during the study period. There is a significant racial disparity in previable preterm births, with black mothers incurring a 3- to 6-fold increased relative risk compared with white mothers, most of which are spontaneous in nature. This may explain much of the racial disparity in infant mortality because all live-born previable preterm births result in death. Focused efforts on the prevention of spontaneous previable preterm birth may help to reduce the racial disparity in infant mortality.","prematurity; preterm birth; previable birth; racial disparity; Adult; African Americans; Age Factors; Congenital Abnormalities; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genetic Diseases, Inborn; Gestational Age; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Infant, Extremely Premature; Live Birth; Marital Status; Ohio; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Pregnancy, Multiple; Premature Birth; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult",to quantify racial differences in previable birth and their contribution to infant mortality and to estimate the relative influence of factors associated with live birth occurring before the threshold of viability,OH,2006,2012,Retrospective Cohort,US live birth records from Ohio birth certificate data,White (non-Hispanic),-99,Black (non-Hispanic),-99,Hispanic,-99,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

For every maternal death, 100 women experience severe maternal morbidity, a life-threatening diagnosis, or undergo a life-saving procedure during their delivery hospitalization. Like maternal mortality, severe maternal morbidity is more common among black than white women. A significant portion of maternal morbidity and mortality is preventable, making quality of care in hospitals a critical lever for improving outcomes. Hospital variation in risk-adjusted severe maternal morbidity rates exists. The extent to which variation in hospital performance on severe maternal morbidity rates contributes to black-white disparities in New York City hospitals has not been studied. We examined the extent to which black-white differences in severe maternal morbidity rates in New York City hospitals can be explained by differences in the hospitals in which black and white women deliver. We conducted a population-based study using linked 2011-2013 New York City discharge and birth certificate datasets (nÂ =Â 353,773 deliveries) to examine black-white differences in severe maternal morbidity rates in New York City hospitals. A mixed-effects logistic regression with a random hospital-specific intercept was used to generate risk-standardized severe maternal morbidity rates for each hospital (nÂ = 40). We then assessed differences in the distributions of black and white deliveries among these hospitals. Severe maternal morbidity occurred in 8882 deliveries (2.5%) and was higher among black than white women (4.2% vs 1.5%, PÂ &lt; .001). After adjustment for patient characteristics and comorbidities, the risk remained elevated for black women (odds ratio, 2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.89-2.17). Risk-standardized severe maternal morbidity rates among New York City hospitals ranged from 0.8 to 5.7 per 100 deliveries. White deliveries were more likely to be delivered in low-morbidity hospitals: 65% of white vs 23% of black deliveries occurred in hospitals in the lowest tertile for morbidity. We estimated that black-white differences in delivery location may contribute as much as 47.7% of the racial disparity in severe maternal morbidity rates in New York City. Black mothers are more likely to deliver at higher risk-standardized severe maternal morbidity hospitals than are white mothers, contributing to black-white disparities. More research is needed to understand the attributes of high-performing hospitals and to share best practices among hospitals.","disparities; hospital; severe maternal morbidity; Adolescent; Adult; African Americans; Delivery, Obstetric; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Hospitals; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Maternal Health; Middle Aged; New York City; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Young Adult",examined the extent to which black-white differences in severe maternal morbidity rates in New York City hospitals can be explained by differences in the hospitals in which black and white women deliver,NY,2011,2013,Retrospective Cohort,Vital Statistics birth records linked with New York state discharge abstract data; Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System,Non-Hispanic White,110200,Non-Hispanic Black,72849,Hispanic,-99,Asian,-99,Other,-99,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Despite this well-documented health disparity, the relationship of comorbid conditions, such as chronic hypertension, to maternal race/ethnicity and preterm birth has received relatively limited attention in the literature. The objective of the study was to evaluate the interaction between chronic hypertension and maternal racial/ethnic background on preterm birth. This is a retrospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies among women who delivered between 2002 and 2015 at the University of California, San Francisco. The associations of chronic hypertension with both spontaneous and medically indicated preterm birth were examined by univariate and multivariate logistical regression, adjusting for confounders including for maternal age, history of preterm birth, maternal body mass index, insurance type (public vs private), smoking, substance abuse, history of pregestational diabetes mellitus, and use of assisted reproductive technologies. The interaction effect of chronic hypertension and racial/ethnicity was also evaluated. All values are reported as odds ratios, with 95% confidence intervals and significance set at PÂ = .05. In this cohort of 23,425 singleton pregnancies, 8.8% had preterm deliveries (3% were medically indicated preterm birth, whereas 5.5% were spontaneous preterm births), and 3.8% of women carried the diagnosis of chronic hypertension. Chronic hypertension was significantly associated with preterm birth in general (adjusted odds ratio, 2.74, P &lt; .001) and medically indicated preterm birth specifically (adjusted odds ratio, 5.25, P &lt; .001). When evaluating the effect of chronic hypertension within racial/ethnic groups, there was an increased odds of a preterm birth among hypertensive, African-American women (adjusted odds ratio, 3.91, P &lt; .001) and hypertensive, Asian-American/Pacific Islander women (adjusted odds ratio, 3.51, P &lt; .001) when compared with their nonhypertensive counterparts within the same racial/ethnic group. These significant effects were also noted with regard to medically indicated preterm birth for hypertensive African-American women (adjusted odds ratio, 6.85, P &lt; .001) and Asian-American/Pacific Islander women (adjusted odds ratio, 9.87, P &lt; .001). There was no significant association of chronic hypertension with spontaneous preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio, 0.87, PÂ = .4). The effect of chronic hypertension on overall preterm birth and medically indicated preterm birth differs by racial/ethnic group. The larger effect of chronic hypertension among African-American and Asian/Pacific Islander women on medically indicated and total preterm birth rates raises the possibility of an independent variable that is not captured in the data analysis, although data regarding the indication for medically indicated preterm delivery was limited in this data set. Further investigation into both social-structural and biological predispositions to preterm birth should accompany research focusing on the effect of chronic hypertension on birth outcomes.","African-American heritage; chronic hypertension; maternal racial/ethnic background; preterm birth; Adult; African Americans; Asian Americans; Body Mass Index; California; Cohort Studies; Ethnic Groups; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Gestational Age; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Hypertension; Insurance, Health; Linear Models; Logistic Models; Maternal Age; Multivariate Analysis; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular; Pregnancy in Diabetics; Premature Birth; Retrospective Studies; San Francisco; Smoking; Substance-Related Disorders; Young Adult",to evaluate the interaction between chronic hypertension and maternal racial/ethnic background on preterm birth,CA,2002,2015,Retrospective Cohort,"University of California, San Francisco",White,10843,African American,2272,Latina/Hispanic,3193,Asian/Pacific Islander,4431,Other,2686,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

The purpose of this study was to estimate changes in the prevalence of overall pregestational diabetes mellitus (all types) and pregestational type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus and to estimate whether changes varied by race-ethnicity from 1996-2014. We conducted a cohort study among 655,428 pregnancies at a Northern California integrated health delivery system from 1996-2014. Logistic regression analyses provided estimates of prevalence and trends. The age-adjusted prevalence (per 100 deliveries) of overall pregestational diabetes mellitus increased from 1996-1999 to 2012-2014 (from 0.58 [95% confidence interval, 0.54-0.63] to 1.06 [95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.12]; Ptrend &lt;.0001). Significant increases occurred in all racial-ethnic groups; the largest relative increase was among Hispanic women (121.8% [95% confidence interval, 84.4-166.7]); the smallest relative increase was among non-Hispanic white women (49.6% [95% confidence interval, 27.5-75.4]). The age-adjusted prevalence of pregestational type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus increased from 0.14 (95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.16) to 0.23 (95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.27; Ptrend &lt;.0001) and from 0.42 (95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.46) to 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.73-0.83; Ptrend &lt;.0001), respectively. The greatest relative increase in the prevalence of type 1 diabetes mellitus was in non-Hispanic white women (118.4% [95% confidence interval, 70.0-180.5]), who had the lowest increases in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (13.6% [95% confidence interval, -8.0 to 40.1]). The greatest relative increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was in Hispanic women (125.2% [95% confidence interval, 84.8-174.4]), followed by African American women (102.0% [95% confidence interval, 38.3-194.3]) and Asian women (93.3% [95% confidence interval, 48.9-150.9]). The prevalence of overall pregestational diabetes mellitus and pregestational type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus increased from 1996-1999 to 2012-2014 and racial-ethnic disparities were observed, possibly because of differing prevalence of maternal obesity. Targeted prevention efforts, preconception care, and disease management strategies are needed to reduce the burden of diabetes mellitus and its sequelae.","diabetes mellitus; pregnancy; prevalence; racial-ethnic disparities; Adult; African Americans; Asian Americans; California; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Ethnic Groups; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Status Disparities; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Logistic Models; Obesity; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy in Diabetics; Prevalence; Young Adult",to estimate changes in the prevalence of overall pregestational diabetes mellitus (all types) and pregestational type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus and to estimate whether changes varied by race-ethnicity from 1996-2014,CA,1996,2014,Retrospective Cohort,Kaiser Permanente Northern California,Non-Hispanic White,264051,African American,46722,Asian,122930,Hispanic,160625,Other,47524,Missing,13576,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Sex differences between and within race were examined. Black preterm infants had an elevated risk for perinatal death, but there was no difference in risk for neonatal death across racial groups. Relative to white infants, black infants were significantly more likely to experience sepsis (9.1% vs 13.6%), peri- or intraventricular hemorrhage (2.6% vs 3.3%), intracranial hemorrhage (0.6% vs 1.8%), and retinopathy of prematurity (1.0% vs 2.6%). Hispanic and white preterm neonates had similar risk profiles. In general, female infants had lower risk relative to male infants, with white female infants having the lowest prevalence of a composite indicator of perinatal death or any morbidity across all races (30.9%). Differences in maternal demographics, health behaviors, and medical history did little to influence these associations, which were robust to sensitivity analyses of pregnancy complications as potential underlying mechanisms. Preterm infants were at similar risk for neonatal death, regardless of race; however, there were notable racial disparities and sex differences in rare, but serious, adverse neonatal morbidities.","intracranial hemorrhage; intraventricular hemorrhage; necrotizing enterocolitis; neonatal death; perinatal death; preterm birth; respiratory distress syndrome; retinopathy of prematurity; sepsis; transientÂ tachypnea; Adult; African Americans; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Infant; Infant, Premature, Diseases; Male; Retrospective Studies",The purpose of this study was to determine whether the risk for morbidity and death among infants who are born preterm differs by maternal race.,"CA, DE, FL, IL, IN, MD, MA, NY, OH, TX, UT, DC",2002,2008,Retrospective Cohort,Consortium on Safe Labor; electronic medical records,White,9024,Black,6950,Hispanic,3883,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Despite current efforts, black women exhibit greater risk for pregnancy complications and negative perinatal outcomes compared with white women. The placenta, which is a complex multi-tissue organ, serves as the primary transducer of bidirectional information between the mother and fetus. Altered placental function is linked to multiple racially disparate pregnancy complications; however, little is known about racial differences in molecular factors within the placenta. Several pregnancy complications, which include preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction, exhibit racial disparities and are associated with shorter placental telomere length, which is an indicator of cellular stress and aging. Cellular senescence and telomere dynamics are linked to the molecular mechanisms that are associated with the onset of labor and parturition. Further, racial differences in telomere length are found in a range of different peripheral tissues. Together these factors suggest that exploration of racial differences in telomere length of the placenta may provide novel mechanistic insight into racial disparities in birth outcomes. This study examined whether telomere length measured in 4 distinct fetally derived tissues were significantly different between black and white women. The study had 2 hypotheses: (1) that telomere length that is measured in different placental tissue types would be correlated and (2) that across all sampled tissues telomere length would differ by race. In a prospective study, placental tissue samples were collected from the amnion, chorion, villus, and umbilical cord from black and white singleton pregnancies (N=46). Telomere length was determined with the use of monochrome multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in each placental tissue. Demographic and pregnancy-related data were also collected. Descriptive statistics characterized the sample overall and among black and white women separately. The overall impact of race was assessed by multilevel mixed-effects linear regression models that included empirically relevant covariates. Telomere length was correlated significantly across all placental tissues. Pairwise analyses of placental tissue telomere length revealed significantly longer telomere length in the amnion compared with the chorion (t=-2.06; P=.043). Overall telomere length measured in placenta samples from black mothers were significantly shorter than those from white mothers (Î²=-0.09; P=.04). Controlling for relevant maternal and infant characteristics strengthened the significance of the observed racial differences (Î²=-0.12; P=.02). Within tissue analyses revealed that the greatest difference by race was found in chorionic telomere length (t=-2.81; P=.007). These findings provide the first evidence of racial differences in placental telomere length. Telomere length was significantly shorter in placental samples from black mothers compared with white mothers. Given previous studies that have reported that telomere length, cellular senescence, and telomere dynamics are molecular factors that contribute to the rupture of the amniotic sac, onset of labor, and parturition, our findings of shorter telomere length in placentas from black mothers suggest that accelerated cellular aging across placental tissues may be relevant to the increased risk of preterm delivery in black pregnancies. Our results suggest that racial differences in cellular aging in the placenta contribute to the earliest roots of health disparities.","cellular aging; health disparity; placenta; pregnancy complication; race; telomere length; Adult; African Americans; Cellular Senescence; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Placenta; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Prospective Studies; Telomere; Telomere Homeostasis",This study examined whether telomere length measured in 4 distinct fetally derived tissues were significantly different between black and white women.

Our objective of this secondary analysis was to estimate the risk of unintended pregnancy for both Black and White teens age 15-19 years when barriers to access, cost, and knowledge are removed. Our hypothesis was that the Black-White disparities would be reduced when access, education, and cost barriers are removed. We performed an analysis of the Contraceptive CHOICE Project database. CHOICE is a longitudinal cohort study of 9256 sexually active girls and women ages 14-45 years in the St Louis, MO, region from 2007 through 2013. Two measures of disparities were used to analyze teenage pregnancy rates and pregnancy risk from 2008 through 2013 among teens ages 15-19 years. These rates were then compared to the rates of pregnancy among all sexually active teens in the United States during the years 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. We estimated an absolute measure (rate difference) and a relative measure (rate ratio) to examine Black-White disparities in the rates of unintended pregnancy. While national rates of unintended pregnancy are decreasing, racial disparities in these rates persist. The Black-White rate difference dropped from 158.5 per 1000 in 2008 to 120.1 per 1000 in 2011; however, the relative ratio disparity decreased only from 2.6-2.5, suggesting that Black sexually active teens in the United States have 2.5 times the rate of unintended pregnancy as White teenagers. In the CHOICE Project, there was a decreasing trend in racial disparities in unintended pregnancy rates among sexually active teens (age 15-19 years): 2008 through 2009 (rate difference, 18.2; rate ratio, 3.7), 2010 through 2011 (rate difference, 4.3; rate ratio, 1.2), and 2012 through 2013 (rate difference, -1.5; rate ratio, 1.0). When barriers to cost, access, and knowledge were removed, such as in the Contraceptive CHOICE Project, Black-White disparities in unintended pregnancy rates among sexually active teens were reduced on both absolute and relative scales. The rate of unintended pregnancy was almost equal between Black and White teens compared to large Black-White disparities on the national level.","contraception; health disparities; teenage girls; unintended pregnancy; Adolescent; African Americans; Contraceptive Devices, Female; Databases, Factual; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Services Accessibility; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy in Adolescence; Pregnancy, Unplanned; United States; Young Adult","To estimate the risk of unintended pregnancy for both Black and White teens age 15-

Approximately 450,000 hysterectomy procedures are performed each year in the United States for benign indications. However, little is known regarding contemporary USÂ hysterectomy trends for women with benign disease with respect toÂ operative technique and perioperative complications, and the association between these 2 factors with patient, surgeon, and hospital characteristics. We sought to describe contemporary hysterectomy trends and explore associations between patient, surgeon, and hospital characteristics with surgical approach and perioperative complications. Hysterectomies performed for benign indications by general gynecologists from July 2012 through September 2014 were analyzed in the all-payer Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission database. We excluded hysterectomies performed by gynecologic oncologists, reproductive endocrinologists, and female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgeons. We included both open hysterectomies and those performed by minimally invasive surgery, which included vaginal hysterectomies. Perioperative complications were defined using the Agency for Healthcare Research and QualityÂ patient safety indicators. Surgeon hysterectomy volume during the 2-year study period was analyzed (0-5 cases annuallyÂ = very low, 6-10Â = low, 11-20Â = medium, and â‰¥21Â = high). We utilized logistic regression and negative binomial regression to identify patient, surgeon, and hospital characteristics associated with minimally invasive surgery utilization and perioperative complications, respectively. A total of 5660 hospitalizations were identified during the study period. Most patients (61.5%) had an open hysterectomy; 38.5% underwent a minimally invasive surgery procedure (25.1% robotic, 46.6% laparoscopic, 28.3% vaginal). Most surgeons (68.2%) were very low- or low-volume surgeons. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of undergoing minimally invasive surgery included older patient age (reference 45-64 years; 20-44 years: adjusted odds ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.28), black race (reference white; adjusted odds ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.78), Hispanic ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.80), smaller hospital (reference large; small: adjusted odds ratio, 0.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.45; medium: adjusted odds ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.79-0.96), medium hospital hysterectomy volume (reference â‰¥200 hysterectomies; 100-200: adjusted odds ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-0.87), and medium vs high surgeon volume (reference high; medium: adjusted odds ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.97). Complications occurred in 25.8% of open and 8.2% of minimally invasive hysterectomies (P &lt; .0001). Minimally invasive hysterectomy (adjusted odds ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.27) and large hysterectomy volume hospitals (reference â‰¥200 hysterectomies; 1-100: adjusted odds ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.60-3.20; 101-200: adjusted odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-2.16) were associated with fewer complications, while patient payer, including Medicare (reference private; adjusted oddsÂ ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.33-2.61), Medicaid (adjusted odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-2.04), and self-pay status (adjusted odds ratio, 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.40-4.12), and very-low and low surgeon hysterectomy volume (reference â‰¥21 cases; 1-5 cases: adjusted odds ratio, 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-2.47; 6-10 cases: adjusted odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.23) were associated with perioperative complications. Use of minimally invasive hysterectomy for benign indications remains variable, with most patients undergoing open, more morbid procedures. Older and black patients and smaller hospitals are associated with open hysterectomy.

Differences in contraceptive preferences, beliefs, and self-efficacy may be instrumental in understanding contraceptive behaviors that underlie higher rates of unintended pregnancy among racial/ethnic minorities. Our objective was to understand how contraceptive preferences, beliefs, and self-efficacy vary by race and ethnicity among women veterans. We analyzed data from the Examining Contraceptive Use and Unmet Need Study, a national telephone survey of women veterans aged 18-44 years who had received primary care at the Veterans Administration in the prior 12 months. Participants rated the importance of various contraceptive characteristics and described their level of agreement with contraceptive beliefs using Likert scales. Contraceptive self-efficacy was assessed by asking participants to rate their certainty that they could use contraception consistently and as indicated over time using a Likert scale. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations between race/ethnicity and contraceptive attitudes, controlling for age, marital status, education, income, religion, parity, deployment history, and history of medical and mental health conditions. Among the 2302 women veterans who completed a survey, 52% were non-Hispanic white, 29% were non-Hispanic black, and 12% were Hispanic. In adjusted analyses, compared with whites, blacks had lower odds of considering contraceptive effectiveness extremely important (adjusted odds ratio; 0.55, 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.74) and higher odds of considering the categories of does not contain any hormones and prevents sexually transmitted infections extremely important (adjusted odds ratio, 1.94, 95% confidence interval, 1.56-2.41, and adjusted odds ratio; 1.99, 95% confidence interval, 1.57-2.51, respectively).

To assess racial/ethnic variation in receipt of postpartum care and contraception among low-income women in California. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 199,860 Californian women aged 15-44 with a Medicaid-funded delivery in 2012. We examined racial/ethnic variation of postpartum care and contraception using multivariable logistic regression to control for maternal age, language, cesarean delivery, Medicaid program, and residence in a primary care shortage area (PCSA). Only one-half of mothers attended a postpartum visit (49.4%) or received contraception (47.5%).

Treatment can consist of either surgery with salpingectomy or salpingostomy or medical management with methotrexate. In addition to acute complications, treatment of ectopic pregnancy can result in long-term sequelae that include decreased fertility. Little is known about the patterns of care and predictors of treatment in women with ectopic pregnancy. Similarly, data on outcomes for various treatments are limited. We examined the patterns of care and outcomes for women with ectopic pregnancy. Specifically, we examined predictors of medical (vs surgical) management of ectopic pregnancy and tubal conservation (salpingostomy vs salpingectomy) among women who underwent surgery. The Perspective database was used to identify women with a diagnosis of tubal ectopic pregnancy treated from 2006-2015. Perspective is an all-payer database that collects data on patients at hospitals from throughout the United States. Women were classified as having undergone medical treatment, if they received methotrexate, and surgical treatment, if treatment consisted of salpingostomy or salpingectomy. Multivariable models were developed to examine predictors of medical treatment and of tubal conserving salpingostomy among women who were treated surgically. Among the 62,588 women, 49,090 women (78.4%) were treated surgically, and 13,498 women (21.6%) received methotrexate. Use of methotrexate increased from 14.5% in 2006 to 27.3% by 2015 (P&lt;.001). Among women who underwent surgery, salpingostomy decreased over time from 13.0% in 2006 to 6.0% in 2015 (P&lt;.001). Treatment in more recent years, at a teaching hospital and at higher volume centers, were associated with the increased use of methotrexate (P&lt;.05 for all).

This was a population-based retrospective cohort study, using the Virginia Intergenerational Linked Birth File. All non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White mothers born in Virginia 1960 through 1996 who delivered their first live-born, nonanomalous, singleton infant â‰¥20 weeks from 2005 through 2009 were included. We assessed the overall gestational age distribution between non-Hispanic Black and White mothers born term and preterm (&lt;37 weeks) and their infants born term and preterm (&lt;37 weeks) using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survivor functions. Mothers were grouped by maternal gestational age at delivery (term, â‰¥37 completed weeks; late preterm birth, 34-36 weeks; and early preterm birth, &lt;34 weeks). The primary outcomes were: (1) preterm birth among all eligible births; and (2) suspected spontaneous preterm birth among births to women with medical complications (eg, diabetes, hypertension, preeclampsia and thus higher risk for a medically indicated preterm birth). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds of preterm birth and spontaneous preterm birth by maternal race and maternal gestational age after adjusting for confounders including maternal education, maternal age, smoking, drug/alcohol use, and infant gender. Of 173,822 deliveries captured in the intergenerational birth cohort, 71,676 (41.2%) women met inclusion criteria for this study. Of the entire cohort, 30.0% (nÂ = 21,467) were non-Hispanic Black and 70.0% were non-Hispanic White mothers.

We sought to determine whether access to minimally invasive hysterectomy for benign indications is differential according to race independent of the effects of relevant subject-level confounding factors. The secondary study objective was to determine the association between socioeconomic status and ethnicity and access to minimally invasive hysterectomy. A cross-sectional study evaluated factors associated with minimally invasive hysterectomies performed for fibroids and/or abnormal uterine bleeding from 2010 through 2013 at 3 hospitals within an academic university health system in Philadelphia, PA. Univariate tests of association and multivariable logistic regression identified factors significantly associated with minimally invasive hysterectomy compared to the odds of treatment with the referent approach of abdominal hysterectomy. Of 1746 hysterectomies evaluated meeting study inclusion criteria, 861 (49%) were performed abdominally, 248 (14%) vaginally, 310 (18%) laparoscopically, and 327 (19%) with robot assistance. In univariate analysis, African American race (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.97) and Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-1.00) were associated with lower odds of any minimally invasive hysterectomy relative to abdominal hysterectomy. In analyses adjusted for age, body mass index, income quartile, obstetrical and surgical history, uterine weight, and additional confounding factors, African American race was no longer a risk factor for reduced minimally invasive hysterectomy (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.61-1.10), while Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.76) and Medicaid enrollment (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.90) were associated with significantly lower odds of treatment with any minimally invasive hysterectomy. In adjusted analyses, African American women had nearly half the odds of receiving robot-assisted hysterectomy compared to whites (adjusted odds ratio, 0.57; 95%, confidence interval 0.39-0.82), while no differences were noted with other hysterectomy routes. Medicaid enrollment (compared to private insurance; odds ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.94) and lowest income quartile (compared to highest income quartile; odds ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.85) were also associated with diminished odds of robot-assisted hysterectomy. When accounting for the effect of numerous pertinent demographic and clinical factors, the odds of undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy were diminished in women of Hispanic ethnicity and in those enrolled in Medicaid but were not discrepant along racial lines. However, both racial and socioeconomic disparities were observed with respect to access to robot-assisted hysterectomy despite the availability of robotic assistance in all hospitals treating the study population. Strategies to ensure equal access to all minimally invasive routes for all women should be explored to align delivery of care with the evidence supporting the broad implementation of these procedures as safe, cost-effective, and highly acceptable to patients.","disparities; ethnicity; hysterectomy; income; insurance; minimally invasive; race; socioeconomic status; Adult; African Americans; Age Factors; Body Mass Index; Continental Population Groups; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnic Groups; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Hysterectomy; Hysterectomy, Vaginal; Insurance, Health; Laparoscopy; Leiomyoma; Logistic Models; Medicaid; Middle Aged; Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures; Odds Ratio; Philadelphia; Risk Factors; Robotic Surgical Procedures; United States; Uterine Hemorrhage; Uterine Neoplasms",We sought to determine whether access to minimally invasive hysterectomy for benign indications is differential according to race independent of the effects of relevant subject-level confounding factors.

The objective of this study was to assess how race is associated with adverse maternal outcomes in the setting of postpartum hemorrhage. This retrospective cohort study utilized the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS) from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for the years 2012-2014. Women aged 15-54 years with a diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage were included. Race and ethnicity were categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, Native American, other, and unknown. Overall risk for severe morbidity based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria was analyzed along with risk for specific outcomes such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, hysterectomy, transfusion, and maternal death. Risk for severe morbidity was stratified by comorbid risk and compared byÂ race. Weights were applied to create population estimates. Log-linear regression models were created to assess risk for severe morbidity with risk ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals as measures of effect. A total of 360,370 women with postpartum hemorrhage from 2012 to 2014 were included in this analysis. Risk for severe morbidity was significantly higher among non-Hispanic black women (26.6%) than non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, or Asian or Pacific Islander women (20.7%, 22.5%, and 21.4%, respectively, P &lt; .01). For non-Hispanic black compared with non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, and Asian or Pacific Islander women risk was higher for disseminated intravascular coagulation (8.4% vs 7.1%, 6.8%, and 6.8%, respectively, P &lt; .01) and transfusion (19.4% vs 13.9%, 16.1%, and 15.8%, respectively, P &lt; .01). Black women were also more likely than non-Hispanic white women to undergo hysterectomy (2.4% vs 1.9%, PÂ &lt;Â .01), although Asian or Pacific Islander women were at highest risk (2.9%). Adjusting for comorbidity, black women remained at higher risk for severe morbidity (P &lt; .01). Risk for death for non-Hispanic black women was significantly higher than for nonblack women (121.8 per 100,000 deliveries, 95% confidence interval, 94.7-156.8 vs 24.1 per 100,000 deliveries, 95% confidence interval, 19.2-30.2, respectively, P &lt; .01).

These survival disparities persist even when disproportionately worse tumor characteristics among black women are accounted. Receipt of less complete adjuvant treatment among black patients with endometrial cancer could contribute to this disparity. We assessed the hypothesis that black women with endometrial cancer are less likely than their white counterparts to receive adjuvant treatment within subgroups defined by tumor characteristics in the NRG Oncology/Gynecology Oncology Group 210 Study. Our analysis included 615 black and 4283 white women with endometrial cancer who underwent hysterectomy. Women completed a questionnaire that assessed race and endometrial cancer risk factors. Tumor characteristics were available from pathology reports and central review. We categorized women as low-, intermediate-, or high-risk based on the European Society for Medical Oncology definition. Adjuvant treatment was documented during postoperative visits and was categorized as no adjuvant treatment (54.3%), radiotherapy only (16.5%), chemotherapy only (15.2%), and radiotherapy plus chemotherapy (14.0%). We used polytomous logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for multivariable-adjusted associations between race and adjuvant treatment in the overall study population and stratified by tumor subtype, stage, or European Society for Medical Oncology risk category. Overall, black women were more likely to have received chemotherapy only (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.86) or radiotherapy plus chemotherapy (odds ratio, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.54-2.62) compared with white women in multivariable-adjusted models. No racial difference in the receipt of radiotherapy only was observed. In tumor subtype-stratified models, black women had higher odds of receiving radiotherapy plus chemotherapy than white women when diagnosed with low-grade endometrioid (odds ratio, 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-3.93) or serous tumors (odds ratio, 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-3.08). Race was not associated with adjuvant treatment among women who had been diagnosed with other tumor subtypes. In stage-stratified models, we observed no racial differences in the receipt of adjuvant treatment. In models that were stratified by European Society for Medical Oncology risk group, black women with high-risk cancer were more likely to receive radiotherapy plus chemotherapy compared with white women (odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.94). Contrary to our hypothesis, we observed higher odds of specific adjuvant treatment regimens among black women as compared with white women within specific subgroups of endometrial cancer characteristics.","adjuvant treatment; endometrial cancer; racial differences; tumor heterogeneity; African Americans; Aged; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Combined Modality Therapy; Endometrial Neoplasms; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Odds Ratio; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant",We assessed the hypothesis that black women with endometrial cancer are less likely than their white counterparts to receive adjuvant treatment within subgroups defined by tumor characteristics in the NRG Oncology/Gynecology Oncology Group 210 Study,USA,2003,2011,Retrospective Cohort,NRG Oncology/GOG 210 Study,White,4283,Black,615,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

We sought to investigate whether, prior to diagnosis, provider recognition of the cardinal symptom of endometrial cancer, postmenopausal bleeding, differs by patient race. Black and White women diagnosed with endometrial cancer (2001 through 2011) from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare who had at least 2 years of claims prior to diagnosis were identified. Bleeding diagnoses along with procedures done prior to diagnosis were captured via claims data. Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of race with diagnostic workup and multivariate models built to determine the association of appropriate diagnostic procedures with stage at diagnosis. In all, 4354 White and 537 Black women diagnosed with endometrial cancer were included. Compared to White women, Black women were less likely to have guideline-concordant care: postmenopausal bleeding and appropriate diagnostic evaluation (70% vs 79%, P &lt; .001), with adjusted relative risk ratios of 1.12-1.73 for different nonguideline-concordant pathways: bleeding without diagnostic procedures, alternative bleeding descriptions, and neither bleeding nor procedures. These pathways were associated with higher odds of advanced stage at diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.90-2.88). The lack of recognition and evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding is associated with advanced stage at diagnosis in endometrial cancer. Older Black women are at highest risk for the most aggressive histology types, yet they are less likely to have guideline-concordant evaluation of vaginal bleeding. Efforts aimed at improving recognition-among patients and providers-of postmenopausal bleeding in Black women could substantially reduce disparities in endometrial cancer.","African-Americans; Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Resultsâ€“Medicare; endometrial cancer; health care disparities; postmenopausal bleeding; racial health disparities; African Continental Ancestry Group; Aged; Endometrial Neoplasms; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Postmenopause; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Risk Factors; SEER Program; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; Uterine Hemorrhage; Women's Health Services","to investigate whether, prior to diagnosis, provider recognition of the cardinal symptom of endometrial cancer, postmenopausal bleeding, differs by patient race",USA,2001,2011,Registry,"Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 Registry",Non-Hispanic White,4354,Black,537,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Recent studies have suggested that obese women have an abnormal microbiota reminiscent of bacterial vaginosis; however, few studies have investigated the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis in overweight and obese populations. Moreover, despite the increased prevalence of obesity and bacterial vaginosis in black women, it is not known whether racial disparities exist in the relationship between obesity and bacterial vaginosis. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between body mass index and bacterial vaginosis as determined by Nugent score and to determine the influence of race in this context. We performed a cross-sectional study using patient data and vaginal smears from 5918 participants of the Contraceptive CHOICE Project. Gram-stained vaginal smears were scored with the Nugent method and categorized as bacterial vaginosis-negative (Nugent score, 0-3), bacterial vaginosis-intermediate (Nugent score, 4-6), or bacterial vaginosis-positive (Nugent score, 7-10). Body mass index was determined with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, and obese individuals were categorized as class I, II, or III obese based on National Institutes of Health and World Health Organization body mass index parameters. Linear regression was used to model mean differences in Nugent scores; Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to model prevalence of bacterial vaginosis. In our cohort, 50.7% of participants were black; 41.5% were white, and 5.1% were of Hispanic ethnicity; the average age of 25.3 years old. Overall, 28.1% of participants were bacterial vaginosis-positive. Bacterial vaginosis was prevalent in 21.3% of lean, 30.4% of overweight, and 34.5% of obese women (P&lt;.001). The distribution of bacterial vaginosis-intermediate individuals was similar across all body mass index categories. Compared with the scores of lean women, Nugent scores were highest among overweight and obese class I women (adjusted mean difference: overweight women, 0.33 [95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.51] and obese women, 0.51 [95% confidence interval, 0.29-0.72]). Consistent with this, overweight and obese women had a higher frequency of bacterial vaginosis compared with lean women, even after adjustment for variables that included race. Among white women, the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis was higher for overweight and class I and class II/III obese white women compared with lean white women, which is a phenomenon not observed among black women and suggests an effect modification. Overweight and obese women have higher Nugent scores and a greater occurrence of bacterial vaginosis compared with lean women. Black women have a greater prevalence of bacterial vaginosis independent of their body mass index compared with white women.","Nugent score; bacterial vaginosis; body mass index; obesity; overweight; race; Adult; African Continental Ancestry Group; Cross-Sectional Studies; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Humans; Obesity; Risk Factors; Vaginal Smears; Vaginosis, Bacterial; Young Adult","The objective of this study was to examine the relationship

To determine the association of race with serious complications during postpartum readmissions. This repeated cross-sectional analysis used the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project from 2012 to 2014. Women ages 15-54 readmitted postpartum after a delivery hospitalization were identified by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. Race and ethnicity were characterized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific islander, Native American, other, and unknown. Overall risk for readmission by race was determined. Risk for severe maternal morbidity during readmissions by race was analyzed. Individual outcomes including pulmonary edema/acute heart failure and stroke also were analyzed by race. Log-linear regression models including demographics, hospital factors, and comorbid risk were used to analyze risk for severe maternal morbidity during postpartum readmissions. Of 11.3 million births, 207,730 (1.8%) women admitted postpartum from 2012 to 2014 were analyzed, including 96,670 white, 47,015 black, and 33,410 Hispanic women. Compared with non-Hispanic white women, non-Hispanic black women were at 80% greater risk of postpartum readmission (95% confidence interval, 79%-82%) whereas Hispanic women were at 11% lower risk of readmission (95% confidence interval, 10%-12%). In unadjusted analysis, compared with non-Hispanic white women, non-Hispanic black women admitted postpartum were at 27% greater risk of severe maternal morbidity (95% confidence interval, 24%-30%) whereas Hispanic women were at 10% lower risk (95% confidence interval, 7%-13%). In the adjusted model, non-Hispanic black women were at 16% greater risk for severe maternal morbidity during readmission than non-Hispanic white women (95% confidence interval, 10%-22%), whereas Hispanic women were at 7% lower risk (95% confidence interval, 1%-12%). Differences in severe maternal morbidity risk between other racial groups and non-Hispanic white women were not significant. In addition to overall morbidity, non-Hispanic black women were at significantly greater risk for eclampsia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and renal failure than other racial groups (P&lt;.05 all). Black women were at 126% greater risk for pulmonary edema/acute heart failure than white women (95% confidence interval, 117%-136%). Black women were more likely (1) to be readmitted postpartum, (2) to suffer severe maternal morbidity during readmission, and (3) to suffer life threatening complications such as pulmonary edema/acute heart failure.

There is a potential for concentration of care to have unwanted consequences, including cost burden, delayed treatment, patient dissatisfaction, and possibly worse clinical outcomes, especially for more vulnerable populations. To describe changes in site of care for patients with endometrial cancer in New York State and to determine whether the distance women traveled for hysterectomy has changed over time. We used the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System to identify women with endometrial cancer who underwent hysterectomy from 2000 to 2014. Demographic and clinical data as well as hospital data were collected. Trends in travel distance (straight-line distance) were analyzed within all hospital referral regions and differences in travel distance over times and across sociodemographic characteristics analyzed. We identified 41,179 subjects. The number of hospitals and surgeons performing hysterectomy decreased across all hospital referral regions over time. The decline in the number of hospitals caring for women with endometrial cancer ranged from -16.7% in Syracuse (12 to 10 hospitals) to -76.5% in Rochester (17 to 4 hospitals). Similarly, the percentage of surgeons within a given hospital referral region operating on women declined from -45.2% in Buffalo (84-46 surgeons) to -77.8% in Albany (72 to 16 surgeons). The median distance to the index hospital for patients increased in all Hospital Referral Regions. For residents in Binghamton, median travel distance increased by 46.9 miles (95% confidence interval, 33.8-60.0) whereas distance increased in Elmira by 19.7 miles (95% confidence interval, 7.3-32.1) and by 12.4 miles (95% confidence interval, 6.4-18.4) in Albany. For residents of Binghamton and Albany, there was a greater than 100% increase in distance traveled over the 15-year time period, with increases of 551.8% (46.9 miles; 95% confidence interval, 33.8-60.0 miles) and 102.5% (12.4 miles; 95% confidence interval, 6.4-18.4 miles), respectively. Travel distance increased for all races and regardless of insurance status but was greatest for white patients and those with private insurance (P&lt;.0001 for both). The number of surgeons and hospitals caring for women with endometrial cancer in New York State has decreased, whereas the distance that patients travel to receive care has increased over time.","centralization of care; endometrial cancer; gynecologic cancer; rural disparities; travel distance; Adult; Aged; Endometrial Neoplasms; Ethnic Groups; Female; Geography; Health Services Accessibility; Hospitals; Hospitals, High-Volume; Hospitals, Low-Volume; Humans; Hysterectomy; Hysterectomy, Vaginal; Insurance, Health; Laparoscopy; Middle Aged; New York; Regional Health Planning; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Travel",To describe changes in site of care for patients with endometrial cancer in New York State and to determine whether the distance women traveled for hysterectomy has changed over time.,NY,2000,2014,Retrospective Cohort,Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System,White,28040,Black,4900,Hispanic,2673,Other,4069,Unknown,1497,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Lack of hands-on training and deficits in provider education are barriers to long-acting reversible contraception access. Identifying the number of long-acting reversible contraception insertions performed by obstetrics-gynecology residents could provide insight into the depth and breadth of long-acting reversible contraception training available to obstetrics-gynecology residents in Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited residency programs. Our study investigates long-acting reversible contraception-specific training in obstetrics-gynecology residency programs across the United States, including the self-reported number of long-acting reversible contraception insertions per resident and the impact of resident demographic characteristics and residency program characteristics on training. Obstetrics-gynecology residents completed a voluntary electronic survey during the 2016 Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology examination. The survey included resident demographic characteristics and residency program characteristics as well as resident education and training in long-acting reversible contraception (number of intrauterine devices and implants inserted, training in immediate postpartum intrauterine device placement). A binary &quot;long-acting reversible contraception insertion experience&quot; variable dichotomized respondents as having a low level of long-acting reversible contraception insertions (0 implants and/or 10 or fewer intrauterine devices ) or a high level of long-acting reversible contraception insertions (1 or more implants and/or 11 or more intrauterine devices). Ï‡<sup>2</sup> tests were used to compare the presence of long-acting reversible contraception insertion experience by postgraduate year, resident demographic characteristics, and residency program characteristics. Adjusted logistic regression was performed to ascertain the independent effects of gender, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white vs other), residency program type (university vs community), and residency program geographic region on the likelihood of &quot;low&quot; overall long-acting reversible contraception insertion experience. In total, 5055 obstetrics-gynecology residents completed the survey (85%); analysis included only residents in United States obstetrics-gynecology programs (N=4322). Of the total analytic sample, 1777 (41.2%) had low long-acting reversible contraception insertion experience. As expected, the number of intrauterine device insertions, implant insertions, and overall long-acting reversible contraception experience increased as residents progressed through training. Long-acting reversible contraception insertion experience varied by residency program geographic region: 169 (27.1%) residents in programs in the West had low long-acting reversible contraception insertion experience compared with 498 (39.0%) in the South, 473 (45.3%) in the Midwest, and 615 (46.0%) in the Northeast. Only 152 (14.9%) of all postgraduate year 4 residents had low long-acting reversible contraception insertion experience. Among postgraduate year 4 residents, low long-acting reversible contraception insertion experience was significantly associated racial/ethnic minority status and community-based residency program type (compared with university-based).

National strategies to improve maternal outcomes are increasingly focused on quality improvement collaboratives. However, the effectiveness of quality collaboratives for reducing racial disparities in maternity care is understudied. To evaluate the impact of a hemorrhage quality-improvement collaborative on racial disparities in severe maternal morbidity from hemorrhage. We conducted a cross-sectional study from 2011 to 2016 among 99 hospitals that participated in a hemorrhage quality improvement collaborative in California. The focus of the quality collaborative was to implement the national maternal hemorrhage safety bundle consisting of 17 evidence-based recommendations for practice and care processes known to improve outcomes. This analysis included 54,311 women from the baseline period (January 2011 through December 2014) and 19,165 women from the postintervention period (October 2015 through December 2016) with a diagnosis of obstetric hemorrhage during delivery hospitalization. We examined whether racial/ethnic-specific severe maternal morbidity rates in these women with obstetric hemorrhage were reduced from the baseline to the postintervention period. In addition, we conducted Poisson Generalized Estimating Equation models to estimate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for severe maternal morbidity comparing each racial/ethnic group with white. During the baseline period, the rate of severe maternal morbidity among women with hemorrhage was 22.1% (12,002/54,311) with the greatest rate observed among black women (28.6%, 973/3404), and the lowest among white women (19.8%, 3124/15,775). The overall rate fell to 18.5% (3553/19,165) in the postintervention period. Both black and white mothers benefited from the intervention, but the benefit among black women exceeded that of white women (9.0% vs 2.1% absolute rate reduction). The baseline risk of severe maternal morbidity was 1.34 times greater among black mothers compared with white mothers (relative risk, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-1.42), and it was reduced to 1.22 (1.05-1.40) in the postintervention period. Sociodemographic and clinical factors explained a part of the black-white differences. After controlling for these factors, the black-white relative risk was 1.22 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.30) at baseline and narrowed to 1.07 (1.92-1.24) in the postintervention period. Results were similar when excluding severe maternal morbidity cases with transfusion alone. After accounting for maternal risk factors, the black-white relative risk for severe maternal morbidity excluding transfusion alone was reduced from a baseline of 1.33 (95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.52) to 0.99 (0.76-1.29) in the postintervention period. The most important clinical risk factor for disparate black rates for both severe maternal morbidity and severe maternal morbidity excluding transfusion alone was cesarean delivery, potentially providing another opportunity for quality improvement. A large-scale quality improvement collaborative reduced rates of severe maternal morbidity due to hemorrhage in all races and reduced the performance gap between black and white women. Improving access to highly effective treatments has the potential to decrease disparities for care-sensitive acute hospital-focused morbidities.","hemorrhage; maternal morbidity; maternal safety; perinatal quality collaboratives; quality improvement; racial/ethnic disparities; Adolescent; Adult; African Americans; Cross-Sectional Studies; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare Disparities; Hemorrhage; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular; Quality Improvement; Severity of Illness Index; United States; Young Adult",To evaluate the impact of a hemorrhage quality- improvement collaborative on racial disparities in severe maternal morbidity from hemorrhage.,CA,2011,2016,Cross-Sectional,California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative,White,309837,Black,55548,Asian,129833,Hispanic,406626,Other,45142,Missing,30982,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The incidence of endometrial cancer is 30% lower in black women compared with white women, yet mortality is 80% higher in black women. Differences in adherence to evidence-based guidelines have been proposed to be major contributors to this disparity. We examined whether adherence to evidence-based treatment recommendations for endometrial cancer could mitigate survival disparities between black and white women. The National Cancer Database was used to identify women with endometrial cancer treated from 2004 through 2016. We established 5 evidence-based quality metrics based on review of primary literature and accepted guidelines: surgical treatment within 6 weeks of diagnosis (Q1), use of minimally invasive surgery (stage I-IIIC; Q2), pelvic nodal assessment (high-risk tumors; Q3), adjuvant radiation (high intermediate risk; Q4), and systemic chemotherapy (stage III-IV; Q5). The rates of 30 and 90 day mortality and 5 year survival were compared between black and white women. To determine the influence of quality on outcomes, we compared outcomes among perfectly adherent black and white women with stage I and III endometrial cancer. We identified 310,208 women including 35,035 (11.3%) black women and 275,173 (88.3%) white women. Black women were less likely than white women to receive Q1 (65.8 vs 75.6%), Q2 (58.5 vs 72.9%), Q3 (71.3 vs 74.2%), and Q5 (72.7 vs 73.2%) (P &lt; .05 for all). Adherence to each quality metrics was associated with improved survival. Among women with stage I disease, perfect adherence to the relative quality metrics was seen in 53.1% of white and 41.5% of black women. Among perfectly adherent stage I patients, outcomes in black women improved relative to unselected black women; however, they still experienced higher risk of 30 day (adjusted relative risk, 2.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-3.90), 90 day (adjusted relative risk, 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-2.76), and 5 year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-1.59) compared with similar white women. Among women with stage III tumors, perfect adherence to the relative quality metrics was seen in 56.6% of white and 44.1% of black women. Perfectly adherent black women with stage III disease had improved outcomes but remained at increased risk of 30 day (adjusted relative risk, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-3.44) and 5 year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-1.50) compared with white women. Black women are less likely than white women with endometrial cancer to receive evidence-based care. However, receipt of evidence-based care mitigates but does not eliminate racial disparities in outcomes and black women remain at greater risk of death from endometrial cancer.","adherence; black; ethnicity; evidence-based care; guidelines; mortality; outcomes; uterine cancer; white; Adult; African Americans; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Endometrial Neoplasms; European Continental Ancestry Group; Evidence-Based Medicine; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Lymph Nodes; Middle Aged; Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures; Neoplasm Staging; Quality of Health Care; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Survival Rate",We examined whether adherence to evidence-based treatment recommendations for endometrial cancer could mitigate survival disparities between black and white women.,USA,2004,2016,Retrospective Cohort,The National Cancer Database,Black,35035,White,275173,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The incidence of infertility is also on the rise, and infertile women experience a higher risk of incident chronic medical disease and cancer, suggesting that fertility may serve as a window to a woman's overall health. To investigate the risk of severe maternal morbidity by maternal fertility status. This was a retrospective cohort analysis using Optum's de-identifed Clinformatics Data Mart Database between 2003 and 2015. Infertile women stratified by infertility diagnosis, testing, or treatment were compared to fertile women seeking routine gynecologic care. In both groups, only women who underwent pregnancy and delivery of a singleton during the follow-up period were included. Main outcomes were severe maternal morbidity indicators, defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and identified by International Classification of Diseases 10<sup>th</sup> Revision and Common Procedural Technology codes within 6 weeks of each delivery. Results were adjusted for maternal age, race, education, nulliparity, smoking, obesity, delivery mode, preterm birth, number of prenatal visits, and year of delivery. A total of 19,658 women comprised the infertile group and 525,695 women comprised the fertile group. The overall incidence of any severe maternal morbidity indicator was 7.0% among women receiving fertility treatment, 6.4% among women receiving a fertility diagnosis, 5.5% among women receiving fertility testing, and 4.3% among fertile women. Overall, infertile women had a significantly higher risk of developing any severe maternal morbidity indicator (adjusted odds ratio, 1.22; confidence interval, 1.14-1.31, P &lt; .01) as well as a significantly higher risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation (adjusted odds ratio, 1.48; confidence interval, 1.26-1.73, P &lt; .01), eclampsia (adjusted odds ratio, 1.37; confidence interval, 1.05-1.79, P &lt; .01), heart failure during procedure orÂ surgery (adjusted odds ratio, 1.54; confidence interval, 1.21-1.97, PÂ &lt;Â .01), internal injuries of the thorax, abdomen, or pelvis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.59; confidence interval, 1.12-2.26, P &lt; .01), intracranial injuries (adjusted odds ratio, 1.77; confidence interval, 1.20-2.61, P &lt; .01), pulmonary edema (adjusted odds ratio, 2.18; confidence interval, 1.54-3.10, P &lt; .01), thrombotic embolism (adjusted odds ratio, 1.58; confidence interval, 1.14-2.17, P &lt; .01), and blood transfusion (adjusted odds ratio, 1.50; confidence interval, 1.30-1.72, P &lt; .01) compared to fertile women. Fertile women did not face a significantly higher risk of any maternal morbidity indicator compared to infertile women. In subgroup analysis by maternal race/ethnicity, the likelihood of severe morbidity was significantly higher among fertile black women compared to fertile white women. There was no difference between infertile black women and infertile white women after multivariable adjustment. Using an insurance claims database, we report that women diagnosed with infertility and women receiving fertility treatment experience a significantly higher risk of multiple indicators of severe maternal morbidity compared to fertile women. The increased risk of severe maternal morbidity noted among fertile black women compared to fertile white women is attenuated among infertile black women, who face risks similar to those of infertile white women.","female infertility; fertility treatment; maternal mortality; racial disparities; severe maternal morbidity; Adult; African Continental Ancestry Group; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cohort Studies; Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation; Eclampsia; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Humans; Infertility, Female; Insurance Claim Reporting; Maternal Age; Postpartum Period; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Reproductive Techniques, Assisted; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors",To investigate the risk of severe maternal morbidity by maternal fertility status.,USA,2003,2015,Retrospective Cohort,Optum's de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart Database,White,-99,Asian,-99,Black,-99,Hispanic,-99,Unknown,-99,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

Using the National Cancer Database, we assessed the hypothesis that among women with endometrioid endometrial cancer, racial/ethnic minority women would have lower odds of receiving guideline-concordant treatment than white women. In addition, we hypothesized that lack of guideline-concordant treatment was linked with worse survival. We defined receipt of guideline-concordant treatment using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to compute odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between race and guideline-concordant treatment. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazards ratios and 95% confidence intervals for relationships between guideline-concordant treatment and overall survival in the overall study population and stratified by race/ethnicity. This analysis was restricted to the 89,319 women diagnosed with an invasive, endometrioid endometrial cancer between 2004 and 2014. Overall, 74.7% of the cohort received guideline-concordant treatment (nÂ = 66,699). Analyses stratified by race showed that 75.3% of non-Hispanic white (nÂ = 57,442), 70.1% of non-Hispanic black (nÂ = 4334), 71.0% of Hispanic (nÂ = 3263), and 72.5% of Asian/Pacific Islander patients (nÂ = 1660) received treatment in concordance with guidelines. In multivariable-adjusted models, non-Hispanic black (odds ratio, 0.92, 95% confidence interval, 0.86-0.98) and Hispanic women (odds ratio, 0.90, 95% confidence internal, 0.83-0.97) had lower odds of receiving guideline-concordant treatment compared with non-Hispanic white women, while Asian/Pacific Islander women had a higher odds of receiving guideline-concordant treatment (odds ratio, 1.11, 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.23). Lack of guideline-concordant treatment was associated with lower overall survival in the overall study population (hazard ratio, 1.12, 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.15) but was not significantly associated with overall survival among non-Hispanic black (hazard ratio, 1.09, 95% confidence interval, 0.98-1.21), Hispanic (hazard ratio, 0.92, 95% confidence interval=0.78-1.09), or Asian/Pacific Islander (hazard ratio, 0.90, 95% confidence interval, 0.70-1.16) women. Non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women were less likely than non-Hispanic white women to receive guideline-concordant treatment, while Asian/Pacific Islander women more commonly received treatment in line with guidelines. Furthermore, in the overall study population, overall survival was worse among those not receiving guideline-concordant treatment, although low power may have had an impact on the race-stratified models.

Little is known about whether variations in unintended pregnancy and contraceptive use across racial and ethnic groups persist among women veteran Veterans Affairs users who have more universal access than other populations to health care and contraceptive services. The objectives of this study were to identify a history of unintended pregnancy and describe patterns of contraceptive use across racial and ethnic groups among women veterans accessing Veterans Affairs primary care. Cross-sectional data from a national random sample of women veterans (nÂ = 2302) aged 18-44 years who had accessed Veterans Affairs primary care in the previous 12 month were used to assess a history of unintended pregnancy (pregnancies reported as either unwanted or having occurred too soon). Any contraceptive use at last sex (both prescription and nonprescription methods) and prescription contraceptive use at last sex were assessed in the subset of women (nÂ = 1341) identified as being at risk for unintended pregnancy. Prescription contraceptive methods include long-acting reversible contraceptive methods (intrauterine devices and subdermal implants), hormonal methods (pill, patch, ring, and injection), and female or male sterilization; nonprescription methods include barrier methods (eg, condoms, diaphragm), fertility-awareness methods, and withdrawal. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between race/ethnicity with unintended pregnancy and contraceptive use at last sex. Overall, 94.4% of women veterans at risk of unintended pregnancy used any method of contraception at last sex. Intrauterine devices (18.9%), female surgical sterilization (16.9%), and birth control pills (15.9%) were the 3 most frequently used methods across the sample. Intrauterine devices were the most frequently used method for Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and other non-Hispanic women, while female surgical sterilization was the most frequently used method among non-Hispanic black women. In adjusted models, Hispanic women (adjusted odds ratio, 1.60, 95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.21) and non-Hispanic black women (adjusted odds ratio, 1.84, 95% confidence interval, 1.44-2.36) were significantly more likely than non-Hispanic white women to report any history of unintended pregnancy. In the subcohort of 1341 women at risk of unintended pregnancy, there were no significant racial/ethnic differences in use of any contraception at last sex. However, significant differences were observed in the use of prescription methods at last sex. Hispanic women (adjusted odds ratio, 0.51, 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.75) and non-Hispanic black women (adjusted odds ratio, 0.69, 95% confidence interval, 0.51-0.95) were significantly less likely than non-Hispanic white women to have used prescription contraception at last sex. Significant racial and ethnic differences exist in unintended pregnancy and contraceptive use among women veterans using Veterans Affairs care, suggesting the need for interventions to address potential disparities. Improving access to and delivery of patient-centered reproductive goals assessment and contraceptive counseling that can address knowledge gaps while respectfully considering individual patient preferences is needed to support women veterans' decision making and ensure equitable reproductive health services across Veterans Affairs.","Examining Contraceptive Use and Unmet Need; Veterans Affairs; family planning; race; reproductive health equity; Adolescent; Adult; African Americans; Coitus Interruptus; Contraception; Contraception Behavior; Contraception, Barrier; Ethnic Groups; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Hispanic Americans; Hormonal Contraception; Humans; Logistic Models; Long-Acting Reversible Contraception; Minority Groups; Natural Family Planning Methods; Pregnancy; Pregnancy, Unplanned; Primary Health Care; Sterilization, Reproductive; United States; United States Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans; Young Adult",The objectives of this study were to identify a history of unintended pregnancy and describe patterns of contraceptive use across racial and ethnic groups among women veterans accessing Veterans Affairs primary care.,USA,2014,2016,Cross-Sectional,Examining Contraceptive Use and Unmet Need Study,Hispanic,285,NH White,1188,NH Black,665,NH Other,164,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

The Affordable Care Act offered states the option to expand Medicaid enrollment eligibility criteria as a means of improving timely and affordable access to care for the most vulnerable. The variable uptake of expansion by states created a natural experiment, allowing for quasi-experimental methods that offer more unbiased estimates of treatment effects from retrospective data than the traditional regression adjustment. To use a quasi-experimental, difference-in-difference framework to create unbiased estimates of impact of Medicaid expansion on women with gynecologic cancer. We performed a quasi-experimental retrospective cohort study from the National Cancer Database files for women with invasive cancers of the uterus, ovary and fallopian tube, cervix, vagina, and vulva diagnosed from 2008 to 2016. Using a marker for state Medicaid expansion status, we created difference-in-difference models to assess the impact of Medicaid expansion on the outcomes of access to and timeliness of care. We excluded women aged &lt;40 years owing to the suppression of the state Medicaid expansions status in the data and women aged â‰¥65 years owing to the universal Medicare coverage availability. Our primary outcome was the rate of uninsurance at diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included Medicaid coverage, early-stage diagnosis, treatment at an academic facility, and any treatment or surgery within 30 days of diagnosis. Models were run within multiple subgroups and on a propensity-matched cohort to assess the robustness of the treatment estimates. The assumption of parallel trends was assessed with event study time plots. Our sample included 335,063 women. Among this cohort, 121,449 were from nonexpansion states and 213,614 were from expansion states, with 79,886 posttreatment cases diagnosed after the expansion took full effect in expansion states. The groups had minor differences in demographics, and we found occasional preperiod event study coefficients diverging from the mean, but the outcome trends were generally similar between the expansion and nonexpansion states in the preperiod, satisfying the necessary assumption for the difference-in-difference analysis. In a basic difference-in-difference model, the Medicaid expansion in January 2014 was associated with significant increases in insurance at diagnosis, treatment at an academic facility, and treatment within 30 days of diagnosis (P&lt;.001 for all). In an adjusted model including all states and accounting for variable expansion implementation time, there was a significant treatment effect of Medicaid expansion on the reduction in uninsurance at diagnosis (-2.00%; 95% confidence interval,Â -2.3 toÂ -1.7; P&lt;.001), increases in early-stage diagnosis (0.80%; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-1.4; P=.02), treatment at an academic facility (0.83%; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-1.5; P=.02), treatment within 30 days (1.62%; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-2.3; P&lt;.001), and surgery within 30 days (1.54%; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-2.3; P&lt;.001). In particular, large gains were estimated for women living in low-income zip codes, Hispanic women, and women with cervical cancer. Estimates from the subgroup and propensity-matched cohorts were generally consistent for all outcomes besides early-stage diagnosis and treatment within 30 days. Medicaid expansion was significantly associated with gains in the access and timeliness of treatment for nonelderly women with gynecologic cancer. The implementation of Medicaid expansion could greatly benefit women in nonexpansion states. Gynecologists and gynecologic oncologists should advocate for Medicaid expansion as a means of improving outcomes and reducing socioeconomic and racial disparities.","Affordable Care Act; cervical cancer; epidemiology; health disparities; ovarian cancer; quasi-experimental methods; uterine cancer; vaginal cancer; vulvar cancer; Adult; African Americans; Cohort Studies; Early Detection of Cancer; Educational Status; Ethnic Groups; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female; Health Policy; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Medicaid; Medically Uninsured; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Non-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Ovarian Neoplasms; Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Poverty; Propensity Score; Residence Characteristics; Retrospective Studies; Time-to-Treatment; United States; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Uterine Neoplasms; Vaginal Neoplasms; Vulvar Neoplasms","To use a quasi-experimental, difference-in-difference framework to create unbiased estimates of impact of Medicaid expansion on women with gynecologic cancer.",USA,2008,2016,Retrospective Cohort,National Cancer Database,Nonwhite,58552,Hispanic,25096,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We leveraged statewide data from California to examine whether birth hospital explained racial and ethnic differences in severe maternal morbidity. This cohort study used data on all births at â‰¥20 weeks gestation in California (2007-2012). Severe maternal morbidity during birth hospitalization was measured using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention index of having at least 1 of the 21 diagnoses and procedures (eg, eclampsia, blood transfusion, hysterectomy). Mixed-effects logistic regression models (ie, women nested within hospitals) were used to compare racial and ethnic differences in severe maternal morbidity before and after adjustment for maternal sociodemographic and pregnancy-related factors, comorbidities, and hospital characteristics. We also estimated the risk-standardized severe maternal morbidity rates for each hospital (N=245) and the percentage reduction in severe maternal morbidity if each group of racially and ethnically minoritized women gave birth at the same distribution of hospitals as non-Hispanic white women. Of the 3,020,525 women who gave birth, 39,192 (1.3%) had severe maternal morbidity (2.1% Black; 1.3% US-born Hispanic; 1.3% foreign-born Hispanic; 1.3% Asian and Pacific Islander; 1.1% white; 1.6% American Indian and Alaska Native, and Mixed-race referred to as Other). Risk-standardized rates of severe maternal morbidity ranged from 0.3 to 4.0 per 100 births across hospitals. After adjusting for covariates, the odds of severe maternal morbidity were greater among nonwhite women than white women in a given hospital (Black: odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.31); US-born Hispanic: odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.29; foreign-born Hispanic: odds ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.24; Asian and Pacific Islander: odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-1.32; Other: odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.50). Among the studied hospital factors, only teaching status was associated with severe maternal morbidity in fully adjusted models. Although 33% of white women delivered in hospitals with the highest tertile of severe maternal morbidity rates compared with 53% of Black women, birth hospital only accounted for 7.8% of the differences in severe maternal morbidity comparing Black and white women and accounted for 16.1% to 24.2% of the differences for all other racial and ethnic groups. In California, excess odds of severe maternal morbidity among racially and ethnically minoritized women were not fully explained by birth hospital. Structural causes of racial and ethnic disparities in severe maternal morbidity may vary by region, which warrants further examination to inform effective policies.","health equity; hospital-level factors; racial and ethnic disparities; severe maternal morbidity; Adult; African Americans; Asian Americans; Birth Setting; Blood Transfusion; California; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Eclampsia; Emigrants and Immigrants; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Gestational Age; Health Equity; Health Status Disparities; Healthcare Disparities; Heart Failure; Hispanic Americans; Hospitals; Hospitals, Private; Hospitals, Public; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Hysterectomy; Indians, North American; Indigenous Peoples; Logistic Models; Middle Aged; Obesity, Maternal; Obstetric Labor Complications; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prenatal Care; Puerperal Disorders; Pulmonary Edema; Respiration, Artificial; Sepsis; Severity of Illness Index; Shock; Tracheostomy; Young Adult","To examine whether birth hospital explained racial and ethnic differences in severe

However, questions still remain as to whether these racial disparities have arisen because of associations between race and oocyte/embryo quality, the uterine environment, or a combination of the two. Oocyte donation assisted reproductive technology represents a unique approach to examine this question. This study aimed to evaluate the associations between the race of female oocyte donors and recipients and live birth rates following vitrified donor oocyte assisted reproductive technologies. This was a retrospective study conducted at a single, private fertility clinic that included 327 oocyte donors and 899 recipients who underwent 1601 embryo transfer cycles (2008-2015). Self-reported race of the donor and recipient were abstracted from medical records. Live birth was defined as the delivery of at least 1 live-born neonate. We used multivariable cluster weighted generalized estimating equations with binomial distribution and log link function to estimate the adjusted risk ratios of live birth, adjusting for donor age and body mass index, recipient age and body mass index, tubal and uterine factor infertility, and year of oocyte retrieval. The racial profile of our donors and recipients were similar: 73% white, 13% Black, 4% Hispanic, 8% Asian, and 2% other. Women who received oocytes from Hispanic donors had a significantly higher probability of live birth (adjusted risk ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.36) than women who received oocytes from white donors. Among Hispanic recipients, however, there was no significant difference in probability of live birth compared with white recipients (adjusted risk ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.90-1.26). Embryo transfer cycles using oocytes from Black donors (adjusted risk ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-1.03) and Black recipients (adjusted risk ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-0.99) had a lower probability of live birth than white donors and white recipients, respectively. There were no significant differences in the probability of live birth among Hispanic, Asian, and other race recipients compared with white recipients. Black female recipients had a lower probability of live birth following assisted reproductive technology, even when using vitrified oocytes from healthy donors. Female recipients who used vitrified oocytes from Hispanic donors had a higher probability of live birth regardless of their own race.","ethnicity; inÂ vitro fertilization; live birth; oocyte donor; oocyte recipient; pregnancy; race; Abortion, Spontaneous; Continental Population Groups; Embryo Transfer; Female; Fertilization in Vitro; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Live Birth; Oocyte Donation; Pregnancy; Retrospective Studies; Tissue Donors; Transplant Recipients; United States","This study aimed to evaluate the associations between the race of female oocyte donors and recipients and live birth rates following vitrified donor oocyte assisted reproductive

Interventions to improve access to cervical cancer preventive care is critical to reduce health inequities. This study aimed to evaluate the need for cervical cancer screening among women seeking assistance with basic needs and to assess best approaches to facilitate Papanicolaou test referral. This study is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial of low-income female callers to 2-1-1 Missouri, a helpline for local health and social services. The need for cervical cancer screening was assessed. Callers were randomized to 1 of 3 arms, each providing a Papanicolaou test referral: verbal referral only, verbal referral and tailored print reminder, or verbal referral and navigator. The primary outcome was contacting a Papanicolaou test referral 1 month following intervention. Student t tests or Mann-Whitney U tests were used to analyze significant differences in continuous variables, whereas Fisher exact or Ï‡<sup>2</sup> tests were used for categorical variables. We stratified by number of unmet basic needs (0-1 vs â‰¥2) and compared success of contacting a Papanicolaou test referral among study groups (verbal referral vs tailored reminder vs navigator) using the Fisher exact test and Ï‡<sup>2</sup> test, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess risk factors for nonadherence for Papanicolaou test at baseline and at 1 month follow-up, adjusting for race and ethnicity, age, insurance status, self-rated health, smoking, and study group. Among 932 female callers, 250 (26.8%) needed cervical cancer screening. The frequency of unmet basic needs was high, the most common being lack of money for unexpected expenses (91.2%) and necessities, such as food, shelter, and clothing (73.2%). Among those needing a Papanicolaou test, 211 women received screening referrals. Women in the navigator group (21 of 71, 29.6%) reported higher rates of contacting a Papanicolaou test referral than those exposed to verbal referral only (11/73, 15.1%) or verbal referral and tailored print reminder (9/67, 13.4%) (P=.03). Among 176 women with â‰¥2 unmet needs who received a Papanicolaou test referral, the provision of a navigator remained associated with contacting the referral (navigator [33.9%] vs verbal referral [17.2%] vs tailored reminder [10.2%]; P=.005). Assignment to the navigator group (adjusted odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-8.5) and nonwhite race (adjusted odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.8) were independent predictors of contacting a Papanicolaou test referral. Low-income women seeking assistance with basic needs often lack cervical cancer screening. Health navigators triple the likelihood that women will make contact with Papanicolaou test services, but most 2-1-1 callers still fail to schedule Papanicolaou testing despite assistance from navigators.

This disparity is theorized to be related to differences in access to healthcare or socioeconomic status. Military service members and their dependents are a diverse community and have equal access to healthcare and similar socioeconomic statuses. This study hypothesized that universal access to healthcare, as seen in the military healthcare system, leads to similar rates of maternal morbidity regardless of race or ethnic background. A retrospective cohort study included data from the inaugural National Perinatal Information Center special report comparing indicators of severe maternal morbidity by race. National Perinatal Information Center data from participating military treatment facilities in the Department of Defense performing more than 1000 deliveries annually from April 1, 2018, to March 31, 2019, were included. Using this convenience data set, Chi-square analyses comparing the percentages of cesarean deliveries, adult intensive care unit admissions, and severe maternal morbidity between Black and White patients were performed. Black women were more likely to deliver via cesarean delivery (31.68% vs 23.58%; P&lt;.0001; odds ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-1.63), be admitted to an adult intensive care unit (0.49% vs 0.18%; P=.0026; odds ratio, 2.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-5.27), and experience overall severe maternal morbidity (2.66% vs 1.66%; P=.0001; odds ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.15) even when excluding blood transfusion (0.64% vs 0.32%; P=.0139; odds ratio, 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-3.36) than their White counterparts. There were no substantial differences between races in overall severe maternal morbidity associated with postpartum hemorrhage even when excluding blood transfusion in this subset. Equal access to healthcare and similar socioeconomic statuses in the military healthcare system do not explain the healthcare disparities seen regarding maternal morbidity encountered by Black women having children in the United States. This study identifies healthcare disparities in severe maternal morbidity among active duty service members and their families.

Cancer-related variables that were associated with a lack of counseling included not receiving chemotherapy as part of treatment and diagnosis with certain cancer types. Counseling about the risk of infertility and available fertility preservation options is important to cancer patients. Additionally, counseling can make women aware of other adverse reproductive outcomes, such as early menopause and its associated symptoms. Less-educated women and parous women are at particular risk of not getting fertility-related information.

Of the 105,083 women, 97,763 (93%) were NHW, 6699 (6.4%) were AS and 621 (0.6%) were AI/AN. AS and AI/AN were younger than NHW with mean age of 57.7 and 56.5 vs. 64.3 years (p &lt; 0.001 and 0.059). Advanced stage and high-risk histology were more prominent in AS than NHW (15.6% vs. 13.3%, p = 0.04, 10.6% vs. 9.6%, p= 0.041). Lymphadenectomy was performed more frequently in AS than NHW (56.7% vs. 48.2%, p &lt; 0.001). Asian immigrants were younger than Asian natives (mean age 57 vs. 60.5 years, p &lt; 0.001). In multivariate analysis, AS had better overall (OS) (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81-0.91, p &lt; 0.001) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84-1.00, p = 0.05) than NHW. Further, Asian immigrants had better OS (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73-0.94, p = 0.002) and CSS (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.54-0.80, p &lt; 0.001) than Asian natives. In contrast, AI/AN had worse OS (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.15-1.59, p &lt; 0.001) but no difference in CSS (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.80-1.40, p = 0.69) than NHW. Asians were younger at presentation, more likely to have lymphadenectomy and had an improved outcome compared to NHW.

Consecutive patients with stage IIIC/IV epithelial ovarian cancer (1/1/96-12/31/06) were identified from the California Cancer Registry. Disease-specific survival analysis was performed using Cox-proportional hazards model. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate for differences in access to high-volume hospitals (HVH) (â‰¥20 cases/year), high-volume physicians (HVP) (â‰¥10 cases/year), and cross-tabulations of high- or low-volume hospital (LVH) and physician (LVP) according to socio-demographic variables. A total of 11,865 patients were identified. The median ovarian cancer-specific survival for all patients was 28.2 months, and on multivariate analysis the HVH/HVP provider combination (HR = 1.00) was associated with superior ovarian cancer-specific survival compared to LVH/LVP (HR = 1.31, 95%CI = 1.16-1.49). Overall, 2119 patients (17.9%) were cared for at HVHs, and 1791 patients (15.1%) were treated by HVPs. Only 4.3% of patients received care from HVH/HVP, while 53.1% of patients were treated by LVH/LVP. Both race and socio-demographic characteristics were independently associated with an increased likelihood of being cared for by the LVH/LVP combination and included: Hispanic race (OR = 1.72, 95%CI = 1.22-2.42), Asian/Pacific Islander race (OR = 1.57, 95%CI = 1.07-2.32), Medicaid insurance (OR = 2.51, 95%CI = 1.46-4.30), and low socioeconomic status (OR = 2.84, 95%CI = 1.90-4.23). Among patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer, the provider combination of HVH/HVP is an independent predictor of improved disease-specific survival. Access to high-volume ovarian cancer providers is limited, and barriers are more pronounced for patients with low socioeconomic status, Medicaid insurance, and racial minorities.","Access to care; Disparities; Ovarian cancer; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; California; Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial; Ovarian Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Survival Analysis; Young Adult",To characterize the impact of hospital and physician ovarian cancer case volume on survival for advanced-stage disease and investigate socio-demographic variables associated with access to high-volume providers.,CA,1996,2006,Retrospective Cohort,California Cancer Registry,White,8509,Black,561,Hispanic,1813,Asian/Pacific Islander,982,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Our objective is to evaluate the association of RGA with EC outcomes. EC patients enrolled onto the GOG-210 protocol were eligible. A randomized subcohort stratified by stage and self-reported race/ethnicity of black or white was used. Genotyping was performed using custom-selected Ancestry Informative Markers to calculate individual admixture estimates of African and European ancestral background. A total of 149 patients were evaluated (self-reported race: 70 black &amp; 79 white). Mean RGA for African ancestry for self-reported black patients was 0.65 (range 0.04-0.86); while mean RGA for European ancestry for self-reported white patients was 0.77 (range 0.12-0.88). Progression-free survival (PFS) analysis using proportional hazards models stratified by stage and race revealed that each 0.10 increase in African ancestry was associated with worse PFS with hazard ratio (HR) of 1.11 (95% CI 0.90-1.37). Each 0.10 increase in European RGA was associated with improved PFS with HR of 0.86 (95% CI 0.69-1.07).

The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used to identify women diagnosed with OGCT. Demographic data were abstracted, including stratification by race and histology. Standard univariate and multivariate analyses using logistic regression were performed to describe predictors of adjuvant treatment. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards survival methods were used to evaluate racial differences in survival between African American (AA) and white (W) women. The study population included 2196 patients, with 1654 (75.3%) W and 328 (14.9%) AA women. Histologic distribution varied significantly by race (p&lt;0.0001), but neither age nor stage at presentation showed racial differences (p=0.086 and p=0.209, respectively). AA received more chemotherapy than W (W: 54.6%, AA: 65.5%, p=0.008), but in multivariate analysis there was no statistically significant difference in any adjuvant treatment modality. Despite similar treatment, and independent of histology, survival varied significantly by race with 91% (CI 0.89-0.93) five year survival in W patients compared to 84% five year survival in AA (CI 0.8-0.89) (p=0.02). These disparities were most pronounced in advanced stage disease, with 5 year survival of 84% (CI 0.79-0.89) in W compared to 61% (CI 0.48-0.78) for AA in stage III (p=0.0002), and 54% (CI 0.42-0.68) compared to 14% (CI 0.03-0.71) for stage IV (p=0.05).

Outcomes for patients undergoing radiation therapy only, 'RT alone' group were compared to those receiving chemotherapy concurrent with radiation 'C-CRT group'. Trends in utilization of C-CRT and factors associated with the deviation from standard of care were explored. Lastly, the effect of hospital volume on utilization of C-CRT was investigated. A total of 18,164 patients undergoing definitive radiation therapy were available for analysis. Utilization of C-CRT increased from 72.4% in 2004 to 84.3% in 2012 (p-trend&lt;0.001). After adjusting for patient, tumor, and treatment factors, a multivariable logistic regression model revealed increasing age, African-American race, Charlson-comorbidity index of â‰¥2, Medicaid insurance status, uninsured status, and Stage I disease were each independently associated with the lack of C-CRT. After adjusting for patient characteristics, low volume hospitals were noted to have overall significantly lower rates and greater variation in C-CRT administration.

This is a cross sectional analysis of patients presenting for surgical management by a gynecologic oncologist at a tertiary care academic medical center. The Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-18) that measures PS in seven domains of health care was administered. Scores were converted to &quot;satisfied&quot; versus &quot;unsatisfied/equivocal&quot;. Demographic and medical factors were obtained from the medical record. Chi-square, t-tests, and multivariable logistic regression were used. 208 patients completed the baseline patient satisfaction questionnaire and the median PSQ-18 score was 70.5 (range: 42-90). Median age was 58years (range: 22-93). Several non-modifiable factors were associated with PS. White patients had higher interpersonal PS than minorities (86% v 65%, p=0.002). The uninsured had lower interpersonal (60% v 86%, p=0.003) and accessibility PS (33% v 67%, p=0.03). Increasing education and less time travelled to care were both associated with higher interpersonal (p=0.03, p=0.05) and accessibility PS (p=0.01, p=0.01). There was no association between clinical factors (BMI, comorbidities, cancer) and PS. In multivariable analysis, the strongest predictor of interpersonal PS was white race while the strongest predictors of accessibility PS were time travelled to care and insurance status.

Standard statistical tests were used. One hundred and one women participated, 54 (53.5%) were black, 31 (30.7%) were white, non-Hispanic and 15 (14.9%) were Hispanic. Screening for anxiety and depression revealed an 18.8% rate of moderate to severe anxiety and an 11.9% rate of moderate to severe depression.

A retrospective study of ovarian cancer patients from 2007 to 2014 was performed. Socioeconomic status (SES) was obtained though U.S. Census block data and compared using Yost scores. Comparisons were performed using standard statistical approaches. A total of 393 patients were evaluated, 325 (83%) white and 68 (17%) black. Demographic information and surgical approach were similar in each racial group. However, compared to whites, black patients had lower rates of optimal debulking [89% vs. 71%, respectively (p=0.001)] and intraperitoneal chemotherapy (19% vs. 11%, p=0.01). Black women had lower SES parameters including education, income, and poverty. As a result, more black patients had the lowest SES (SES-1) when compared to white patients (17% vs. 41%, p&lt;0.001). When controlling for these factors by cox regression analysis, a survival disadvantage was seen in black women for both progression free survival (16 vs. 27months, p=0.003) and overall survival (42 vs. 88months, p&lt;0.001). Despite controlling for clinical and environmental factors, a survival disadvantage was still observed in black patients with ovarian cancer in the Deep South.

We studied 110,826 endometrial cancer patients diagnosed between 1980 and 2008 with minimum 5years follow-up in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Trends over time in sociodemographics, disease characteristics and treatment factors were analyzed over four eras: 1980-1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2004, 2005-2008. Using sequential Cox proportional hazards and Fine-Gray competing risk models we determined the association between potential explanatory variables and racial disparities in all-cause mortality (ACM) and cancer-specific mortality (CSM), respectively. Clinical characteristics of Black and White women were relatively constant over time. The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) among Black women for ACM and CSM were 1.91 (95% CI 1.86-1.97) and 2.35 (95% CI 2.26-2.43), respectively. Adjustment for sociodemographics, disease presentation and surgery decreased the ACM HR to 1.29 (95% CI 1.24-1.34) and CSM HR to 1.18 (95% CI 1.11-1.26) without further decrease from controlling for radiotherapy. Black women were less likely to undergo operative management even when prescribed. Total and radical hysterectomy, and vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) were associated with improved ACM and CSM. Combination VBT and external beam radiotherapy was associated with improved ACM. Racial disparities in endometrial cancer survival are predominantly attributable to increased advanced stage, high-grade and aggressive histologic subtype tumors and differential use of surgery in Black women. Intensified surgical and radiation treatment is associated with improved survival, raising questions about treatment adaptations that may potentially reduce survival disparities.","Healthcare disparities; Hysterectomy; Radiotherapy; SEER program; Uterine neoplasm; Adolescent; Adult; African Americans; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Endometrial Neoplasms; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Status Disparities; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Hysterectomy; Middle Aged; Mortality; SEER Program; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; Young Adult",To examine patterns of care and factors associated with poor outcomes for Black women with endometrial cancer,USA,1980,2008,Registry,"Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database",White,101372,Black,9454,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

These biases can correlate with outcomes that are consequential for the patient. This study examined gynecologic oncology care providers' implicit prejudice and stereotyping toward cervical cancer. Members of professional gynecologic oncology organizations were asked to complete two Implicit Association Tests to determine if they implicitly associate cervical cancer with feelings of anger (prejudice) and beliefs about culpability for the disease (stereotypes), compared to ovarian cancer. Linear models and Student t-tests examined average levels of implicit bias and moderators of the implicit bias effects. One-hundred seventy-six (132 female, 43 male, 1 nonresponse; XÂ¯ageâ€¯=â€¯39.18â€¯years, SDageâ€¯=â€¯10.58â€¯years) providers were recruited and the final sample included 151 participants (93 physicians and 58 nurses, XÂ¯ageâ€¯=â€¯38.93, SDageâ€¯=â€¯10.59). Gynecologic oncology providers showed significant levels of implicit prejudice, XÂ¯â€¯=â€¯0.17, SDâ€¯=â€¯0.47, 95% CI: (0.10, 0.25), toward cervical cancer patients. They also showed significant levels of implicit stereotyping of cervical cancer patients, XÂ¯â€¯=â€¯0.15, SDâ€¯=â€¯0.42, 95% CI: (0.08, 0.21). Whereas physicians did not demonstrate significant levels of implicit bias, nurses demonstrated greater levels of implicit prejudice and implicit stereotyping. Providers without cultural competency/implicit bias training demonstrated greater bias than those who had completed such training (pâ€¯&lt;â€¯.05).

This study evaluated whether racial disparities in the receipt of brachytherapy (BT) for locally advanced cervical cancer mediate survival differences by race using the National Cancer Database. A retrospective cohort study was performed using 16,116 women with stage IB2-IVA cervical cancer treated from 2004 to 2014. Women who did not receive external beam radiation therapy, those with unknown survival data or stage, and those status post hysterectomy or pelvic exenteration were excluded. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to evaluate factors associated with BT use. Using a propensity score adjusted model with inverse probability treatment weighting, adjusted hazard ratios for overall survival were calculated, including an interaction term between BT and race. Of 16,116 patients, 19.2% were black and 55.8% received BT. Black women were significantly less likely to receive BT (AOR 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-0.96, pâ€¯=â€¯0.007) and had worse all-cause mortality (median survival 3.9â€¯years [95% CI 3.6-4.6] versus 5.2â€¯years [95% CI 4.9-5.5] for non-black women, pâ€¯&lt;â€¯0.001).

Women who underwent surgery and were diagnosed with stage I-IV vulvar cancer from 2004 to 2014 in the National Cancer Database were eligible. Proportions were compared using Chi-Square test. Survival was evaluated using Cox analysis. There were 18,207 eligible women. Median age at diagnosis was 64Â years, and 31% diagnosed â‰¥75Â years old were categorized as elderly. Most vulvar cancers were diagnosed at stage I and with squamous histology. Diagnosis with higher stage or non-squamous histology was more common in elderly vs. non-elderly patients (PÂ &lt;Â 0.001). Survival was 3.5 times worse in the elderly than the non-elderly (PÂ &lt;Â 0.0001). Risk of death for each 5-year increment in age increased by 22% for non-elderly and 43% for elderly patients (PÂ &lt;Â 0.0001).

Retrospective cohort study of the National Cancer Database, selecting for patients with T1NxM0 endometrial cancer undergoing minimally invasive surgical staging from 2012 to 2016. Disparities in SLNB utilization were described. Propensity matching was performed. Association of SLNB with perioperative outcomes was assessed with logistic regression. Among 67,365 patients, 6356 (9.4%) underwent SLNB, increasing from 2.8% to 16.3% from 2012 to 2016. Disparities were identified within race (7.0% Black, 9.4% non-Black), ethnicity (8.3% Hispanic, 9.5% non-Hispanic), insurance (6.0% uninsured, 9.5% insured), county density (3.7% rural, 9.8% metro), and income (7.0% bottom-quartile, 11.8% top-quartile). Risk of conversion to open surgery was lower with SLNB alone (1.03%) or SLNB followed by LND (1.40%), versus upfront LND (2.80%). SLNB was associated with reduced risk of conversion to open surgery in Intention-To-Treat (SLNB+/-LND vs. upfront LND; ORITTâ€¯=â€¯0.53; 95%CI 0.39-0.72) and Per-Protocol (PP; SLNB alone vs. upfront LND or SLNB+LND; ORPPâ€¯=â€¯0.49; 95%CI 0.32-0.75) comparisons.

We included 19,865 women (4749 endometrial hyperplasia symptoms, 71 endometrial hyperplasias with atypia, 201 endometrial cancers) with mean age of 60.45Â years (SD 9.94). The odds of endometrial hyperplasia symptoms were higher in non-Hispanic Blacks (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.56, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.20-1.72), Hispanics (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.22-1.49), family history of female cancer (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.12-1.39), hypertension (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.14-1.35), and birth control use (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.15-1.43).

This large cohort study included patients from the National Cancer Database who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer between 2004 and 2014, with follow-up data up to 2017. The multivariable Cox regression was used to assess the effect of study variables on five-year overall survival. The proportion contributions of prognostic factors to the survival disparities were estimated using individual and sequential adjustment of these factors based on the Cox proportional hazards models. Of the 120,712 patients eligible for this study, 110,032 (91.1%) were whites and 10,680 (8.9%) were blacks. Black patients, compared with their white counterparts, had a lower adherence to NCCN guidelines (60.8% vs. 70.4%, respectively, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001), and a higher five-year mortality after cancer diagnosis (age- and tumor characteristics- adjusted hazard ratio: 1.22, 95% confidence interval: 1.19-1.25). Non-adherence to NCCN treatment guidelines was the most significant contributor to racial disparity in ovarian cancer survival, followed by access to care and comorbidity, each explaining 36.4%, 22.7%, and 18.2% of the racial differences in five-year overall survival, respectively. These factors combined explain 59.1% of racial survival disparities. Risk factors identified for non-adherence to treatment guidelines among blacks include insurance status, treatment facility type, educational attainment, age, and comorbidity.

Our objective was to evaluate racial/ethnic disparities in PC utilization among patients with metastatic gynecologic cancer. We used data from the 2016 National Cancer Database (NCDB) and included patients between ages 18-90Â years with metastatic (stage III-IV) gynecologic cancers including, ovarian, cervical and uterine cancer who were deceased at last contact or follow-up (nÂ =Â 124,729). PC was defined by NCDB as non-curative treatment, and could include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and pain management or any combination. We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate racial disparities in PC use. The study population was primarily NH-White (74%), ovarian cancer patients (74%), insured by Medicare (47%) or privately insured (36%), and had a Charlson-Deyo score of zero (77%). Over one-third of patients were treated at a comprehensive community cancer program. Overall, 7% of metastatic gynecologic deceased cancer patients based on last follow-up utilized palliative care: more specifically, 5% of ovarian, 11% of cervical, and 12% of uterine metastatic cancer patients. Palliative care utilization increased over time starting at 4% in 2004 to as high as 13% in 2015, although palliative care use decreased to 7% in 2016.

However, analyses of incidence trends by specific high-risk subtypes are lacking, including those with hysterectomy and active pregnancy correction. The objective of our study was to evaluate racial disparities in age-adjusted incidence of non-endometrioid uterine cancer in 720,984 patients.

Positive associations were observed for BDE153 and several OH-BDEs with IVF endpoints. PBDEs have been voluntarily phased out of production in the USA and EU due to their persistence and toxicity to humans and ecosystems. PBDEs have been associated with implantation failure among women undergoing IVF, yet some animal studies suggest greater toxicity from their metabolites, OH-BDEs. We evaluated a subset of 215 women (contributing 330 IVF cycles) enrolled between 2005 and 2016 in a longitudinal cohort based at Massachusetts General Hospital Fertility Center. The following PBDEs were quantified: 47, 99, 100, 153 and 154 and the following OH-BDEs: 3-OH-BDE47, 5-OH-BDE47, 6-OH-BDE47 and 4-OH-BDE49. Clinical endpoints of IVF treatments were abstracted from electronic medical records. Associations of log-transformed PBDEs and OH-BDEs with IVF outcomes were assessed using multivariable generalized mixed models and cluster weighted generalized estimating equation models adjusted for lipids, age, BMI, race, year of sample collection, IVF protocol and FSH levels. Outcomes were adjusted to represent a percent change in outcome with an increase equal to the magnitude of the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles for each specific compound (interquartile range (IQR) increase). Detection frequencies were highest for congeners 47 and 153 (82%â€‰â‰¥â€‰method detection limit (MDL)) and metabolites 3 and 5-OH-BDE47 and 4-OH-BDE49 (92%â€‰&gt;â€‰MDL). PBDE and OH-BDE geometric mean concentrations declined by up to 80% between participants recruited in 2005 and those recruited in 2016. An IQR increase of BDE153 was associated with an increase in the probability of implantation (relative risk (RR)â€‰=â€‰1.26, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.36), clinical pregnancy (RRâ€‰=â€‰1.32, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.46) and live birth (RRâ€‰=â€‰1.34; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.54). An IQR increase in 3 and 5-OH-BDE47 was associated with increased probabilities of implantation (RRâ€‰=â€‰1.52; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.09), clinical pregnancy (RRâ€‰=â€‰1.66; 95% CI: 1.17, 2.36), and live birth (RRâ€‰=â€‰1.61; 95% CI: 1.07, 2.40). When models were stratified by race (White (86%)/Other race (14%)), associations remained positive for White women, yet inverse associations were observed for Other race women. An IQR increase in BDE47 was associated with a 46% decreased probability of clinical pregnancy (95% CI: 0.31, 0.95) for Other race women. Despite the long half-lives of PBDEs and OH-BDEs, exposure misclassification is possible for women who underwent multiple treatment cycles over several months or years. It is also possible another medium, such as follicular fluid would be optimal to characterize exposure. We also tested associations for multiple congeners and metabolites with multiple outcomes. Detections of serum concentrations of PBDEs and OH-BDEs were highest in the early years of the study and suggests that the phase-out of these compounds has contributed to a decrease in exposure. The negative associations found for PBDEs and IVF outcomes among other race women suggests the potential for racial disparity. Potential racial disparities in PBDE exposure and exploration of alternative flame retardants with reproductive health outcomes should be the focus of future investigations.

In this population of Medicaid recipients, African American women are significantly more likely than whites to experience ectopic pregnancy, but the risk of adverse outcomes has not previously been assessed. We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of all women (n = 19 135 106) ages 15-44 enrolled in Medicaid for any amount of time during 2004-2008 who lived in one of the following 14 US states: Arizona; California; Colorado; Florida; Illinois; Indiana; Iowa; Louisiana; Massachusetts; Michigan; Minnesota; Mississippi; New York; and Texas. We analyzed Medicaid claims records for inpatient and outpatient encounters and identified ectopic pregnancies with a principal diagnosis code for ectopic pregnancy from 2004-2008. We calculated the ectopic pregnancy complication rate as the number of ectopic pregnancies with at least one complication (blood transfusion, hysterectomy, any sterilization, or length-of-stay (LOS) &gt; 2 days) divided by the total number of ectopic pregnancies. We used Poisson regression to assess the risk of ectopic pregnancy complication by race/ethnicity. Secondary outcomes were each individual complication, and ectopic pregnancy-related death. We calculated the ectopic pregnancy mortality ratio as the number of deaths divided by live births. Ectopic pregnancy-associated complications occurred in 11% of cases. Controlling for age and state, the risk of any complication was significantly higher among women who were black (incidence risk ratio [IRR] 1.47, 95% CI 1.43-1.53, P &lt; 0.0001), Hispanic (IRR 1.16, 95% CI 1.12-1.21, P &lt; 0.0001), Asian (IRR 1.34, 95% CI 1.24-1.45, P &lt; 0.0001), American Indian/Alaskan Native (IRR 1.34 95% CI 1.16-1.55, P &lt; 0.0001), and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (IRR 1.61, 95% CI 1.39-1.87, P &lt; 0.0001) compared with white women. The ectopic pregnancy mortality ratio was 0.48 per 100 000 live births, similar to that reported in previous US surveillance. This is a secondary analysis of insurance claims.

This is a cross-sectional analysis of the 2012 National Inpatient Sample, the largest national all-payer database of hospital discharges. International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes for any type of hysterectomy performed for gynecologic malignancy were used to abstract pertinent observations. Weighted multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between demographic and clinical factors and mode of hysterectomy by cancer diagnosis. In 2012, there were an estimated 46,450 hysterectomies for gynecologic malignancy in the United States. Of these, 28,285 (61%) were performed for uterine, 4,275 (9%) for cervical, 12,370 (27%) for ovarian cancer, and 1,520 (3%) for other gynecologic malignancies. Minimally invasive hysterectomy was used in 50% of uterine, 43% of cervical, and 8.5% of ovarian cancer cases. Black women had decreased odds of undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy for uterine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40-0.0.63, P&lt;.001) and cervical (adjusted OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33-0.96, P=.03) cancers. Those without insurance or with Medicaid had decreased odds of undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy (P&lt;.001) for uterine cancer. As compared with the Northeast, patients in the South (adjusted OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.98, P=.04) were less likely to undergo minimally invasive hysterectomy for uterine cancer, whereas those in the West more likely (adjusted OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.10-1.99, P=.009). Minimally invasive hysterectomy for gynecologic malignancies remained underused in 2012; there were striking racial disparities associated with use of minimally invasive hysterectomy for uterine and cervical cancers.

We analyzed hospital discharge data contained in a statewide database maintained by the Connecticut Department of Public Health. Discharge data for patients admitted for vaginal delivery without complication (n=167,857) and cesarean delivery without complication (n=75,552) from 2005 to 2012 were analyzed using marginal logistic models for clustered data with generalized estimating equations. Results from logistic models indicated that 30-day readmission rates per 1,000 patients were significantly higher among black (28.9/1,000; confidence interval [CI] 25.5-32.7) and Hispanic women (21.4/1,000; CI 18.9-24.2) than among white women (12.9/1,000; CI 11.9-14.0) after cesarean delivery. Similarly higher rates of readmission were observed for black (14.6/1,000; CI 13.0-16.5) and Hispanic women (10.7/1,000; CI 9.6-12.0) relative to white women (7.5/1,000; CI 7.0-8.1) after vaginal delivery. Rates of 30-day readmission were significantly higher (odds ratio 1.27-1.30) among those covered by Medicaid. Controlling for patient socioeconomic status, comorbidities, and payer did not substantially reduce race and ethic differences in the odds of readmission. Significant racial and ethnic disparities in readmissions were observed for procedures related to childbirth using a statewide database capturing all payers across all acute care hospital settings. Compared with white women, black women were twice as likely and Hispanic women 40-50% more likely to be readmitted within 30 days of vaginal or cesarean delivery.

We analyzed data from two rounds of the National Survey of Family Growth, nationally representative samples of females aged 15-44 years, consisting of 6,428 females in 2008-2010 and 5,601 females in 2011-2013. We conducted simple and multivariable logistic regression analyses with adjustments for the sampling design to identify demographic characteristics predictive of LARC use and changes in these patterns between the two time periods. In this cross-sectional, descriptive study, our primary outcome of interest was current prevalence of LARC use among all contraceptive users at the time of the interview. The prevalence of LARC use among contracepting U.S. females increased from 8.5% in 2009 to 11.6% in 2012 (P&lt;.01). The most significant increases occurred among Hispanic females (from 8.5% to 15.1%), those with private insurance (7.1-11.1%), those with fewer than two sexual partners in the previous year (9.2-12.4%), and those who were nulliparous (2.1-5.9%) (all P&lt;.01). In multivariable analyses adjusting for key demographic characteristics, the strongest associations with LARC use in 2012 were parity (adjusted odds ratios [ORs] 4.3-5.5) and having a history of stopping non-LARC hormonal use (adjusted OR 1.9). Women aged 35-44 years (adjusted OR 0.3) were less likely to be LARC users than their counterparts (all P&lt;.001). Poverty status was not associated with LARC use. There were no differences in discontinuation of LARC methods resulting from dissatisfaction between minority women and non-Hispanic white women. During the most recent time period surveyed, use of LARC methods, particularly intrauterine devices, increased almost uniformly across the population of users.

Using the National Cancer Database, we performed a retrospective cohort study of women diagnosed between 2004 and 2012 with locally advanced squamous or adenocarcinoma of the cervix undergoing definitive primary radiation therapy. The primary outcome was the race-ethnicity-based rates of adherence to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline-based care. The secondary outcome was the effect of guideline-based care on overall survival. Multivariable models and propensity matching were used to compare the hospital risk-adjusted rates of guideline-based adherence and overall survival based on hospital case volume. The final cohort consisted of 16,195 patients. The rate of guideline-based care was 58.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 57.4-59.4%) for non-Hispanic white, 53% (95% CI 51.4-54.9%) for non-Hispanic black, and 51.5% (95% CI 49.4-53.7%) for Hispanic women (P&lt;.001). From 2004 to 2012, the rate of guideline-based care increased from 49.5% (95% CI 47.1-51.9%) to 59.1% (95% CI 56.9-61.2%) (Ptrend&lt;.001). Based on a propensity score-matched analysis, patients receiving guideline-based care had a lower risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.62-0.68). Compared with low-volume hospitals, the increase in adherence to guideline-based care in high-volume hospitals was 48-63% for non-Hispanic white, 47-53% for non-Hispanic black, and 41-54% for Hispanic women. Racial and ethnic disparities in the delivery of guideline-based care are the highest in high-volume hospitals.

We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study using linked 2011-2013 New York City discharge and birth certificate data sets (n=353,773). Rates of severe maternal morbidity were calculated using a published algorithm based on diagnosis and procedure codes. Mixed-effects logistic regression with a random hospital-specific intercept was used to generate risk-standardized severe maternal morbidity rates for each hospital taking into consideration patient sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities. Differences in the distribution of Hispanic and non-Hispanic white deliveries were assessed among these hospitals in relation to their risk-adjusted morbidity. Sensitivity analyses were conducted after excluding isolated blood transfusion from the morbidity composite. Severe maternal morbidity occurred in 4,541 deliveries and was higher among Hispanic than non-Hispanic white women (2.7% compared with 1.5%, P&lt;.001); this rate was 2.9% among those who were Puerto Rican, 2.7% among those who were foreign-born Dominican, and 3.3% among those who were foreign-born Mexican. After adjustment for patient characteristics, the risk remained elevated for Hispanic women (odds ratio [OR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-1.66) and for all three subgroups compared with non-Hispanic white women (P&lt;.001). Risk for Hispanic women was attenuated in sensitivity analyses (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02-1.33). Risk-standardized morbidity across hospitals varied sixfold. We estimate that Hispanic-non-Hispanic white differences in delivery location may contribute up to 37% of the ethnic disparity in severe maternal morbidity rates in New York City hospitals. Hispanic compared with non-Hispanic white mothers are more likely to deliver at hospitals with higher risk-adjusted severe maternal morbidity rates and these differences in site of delivery may contribute to excess morbidity among Hispanic mothers.

We performed a retrospective cohort study using resident birth certificate data from Florida, Massachusetts, and Michigan linked with data from the National ART Surveillance System from 2000 to 2010. There were 4,568,822 live births, of which 64,834 were conceived with ART. We compared maternal and ART cycle characteristics of singleton liveborn neonates using Ï‡ tests across maternal race and ethnicity groups. We used log binomial models to explore associations between maternal race and ethnicity and LBW and preterm birth by ART conception status. The proportion of liveborn neonates conceived with ART differed by maternal race and ethnicity (P&lt;.01). It was smallest among neonates of non-Hispanic black (0.3%) and Hispanic women (0.6%) as compared with neonates of non-Hispanic white (2.0%) and Asian or Pacific Islander women (1.9%). The percentages of LBW or preterm singletons were highest for neonates of non-Hispanic black women both for non-ART (11.3% and 12.4%) and ART (16.1% and 19.1%) -conceived neonates.

This is a retrospective cohort of pregnant women with pregestational type 1 or type 2 diabetes from 2006 to 2011 in Massachusetts-a state with universal insurance coverage since 2006. Women delivering after 24 weeks of gestation and receiving endocrinology and obstetric care in a multidisciplinary clinic were included. Rates of preconception consultation, our primary outcome of interest, were then compared between publicly and privately insured women. We used univariate analysis followed by logistic regression to compare receipt of preconception consultation and other secondary diabetes care measures and pregnancy outcomes according to insurance status. Fifty-four percent (n=106) of 197 women had public insurance. Publicly insured women were younger (median age 30.4 compared with 35.3 years, P&lt;.01) with lower rates of college education (12.3% compared with 45.1%, P&lt;.01). Women with public insurance were less likely to receive a preconception consult (5.7% compared with 31.9%, P&lt;.01), had lower rates of hemoglobin A1C less than 6% at the onset of pregnancy (37.2% compared with 58.4%, P=.01), and experienced higher rates of pregnancies affected by congenital anomalies (10.4% compared with 2.2%, P=.02) compared with those with private insurance. In adjusted analyses controlling for educational attainment, maternal age, and body mass index, women with public insurance were less likely to receive a preconception consult (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.21, 95% CI 0.08-0.58), although the odds of achieving the target hemoglobin A1C (adjusted OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.20-1.02) and congenital anomaly (adjusted OR 2.23, 95% CI 0.37-13.41) were similar after adjustment. Despite continuous access to health insurance, publicly insured women were less likely than privately insured women to receive a preconception consult-an evidence-based intervention known to improve pregnancy outcomes.

This is a secondary analysis of a multicenter observational obstetric cohort. Trained research personnel abstracted maternal and neonatal records of greater than 115,000 pregnant women from 25 hospitals (2008-2011). Women at term with singleton, nonanomalous, vertex, liveborn neonates were included in two cohorts: 1) nulliparous women (n=35,529); and 2) multiparous women with prior vaginal deliveries only (n=39,871). Women were grouped as non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, and Asian. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the following outcomes: overall cesarean delivery frequency, indications for cesarean delivery, and utilization of labor management strategies intended to safely reduce cesarean delivery. A total of 75,400 women were eligible for inclusion, of whom 47% (n=35,529) were in the nulliparous cohort and 53% (n=39,871) were in the multiparous cohort. The frequencies of cesarean delivery were 25.8% among nulliparous women and 6.0% among multiparous women. For nulliparous women, the unadjusted cesarean delivery frequencies were 25.0%, 28.3%, 28.7%, and 24.0% for non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Asian, and Hispanic women, respectively. Among nulliparous women, the adjusted odds of cesarean delivery were higher in all racial and ethnic groups compared with non-Hispanic white women (non-Hispanic black adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.47, 95% CI 1.36-1.59; Asian adjusted OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.14-1.40; Hispanic adjusted OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.07-1.27) as a result of greater odds of cesarean delivery both for nonreassuring fetal status and labor dystocia. Nonapplication of labor management strategies regarding failed induction, arrest of dilation, arrest of descent, or cervical ripening did not contribute to increased odds of cesarean delivery for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women. Compared with non-Hispanic white women, Hispanic women were actually less likely to experience elective cesarean delivery (adjusted OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42-0.87) or cesarean delivery for arrest of dilation before 4 hours (adjusted OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.92).

Using a retrospective cohort study design of Ohio birth certificates, we analyzed all singleton births between 2000 and 2015 from four groups of women categorized as U.S.-born, non-Hispanic white (USBW), U.S.-born, non-Hispanic black (USBB), African-born black (ABB, primarily of West African birth country), and Somalia-born (SB). An algorithm trained on maternal names was used to confirm Somali ethnicity. Gestational length was analyzed as completed weeks or aggregated by clinically relevant periods. Risk of spontaneous and health care provider-initiated preterm birth was calculated in a competing risk model. Births to women in the designated groups accounted for 1,960,693 births (USBW n=1,638,219; USBB n=303,028; ABB n=10,966, and SB n=8,480). Women in the SB group had a lower preterm birth rate (5.9%) compared with women in the USBB (13.0%), ABB (8.4%), and USBW (7.9%) groups (P&lt;.001). Women in the SB group had a higher frequency of postterm pregnancy (5.8% vs less than 1%, P&lt;.001 for all groups).

Self-reported measures of psychosocial stress (perceived stress, depression, racism, anxiety, resilience, and social support) were collected during pregnancy among a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of women enrolled in a prospective observational study of nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies, from eight clinical sites across the United States, between October 2010 and May 2014. The associations of preterm birth, hypertensive disease of pregnancy, and SGA birth with the self-reported measures of psychosocial stress as well as with race and ethnicity were evaluated. The study included 9,470 women (60.4% non-Hispanic white, 13.8% non-Hispanic black, 16.7% Hispanic, 4.0% Asian, and 5.0% other). Non-Hispanic black women were significantly more likely to experience any preterm birth, hypertensive disease of pregnancy, and SGA birth than were non-Hispanic white women (12.2% vs 8.0%, 16.7% vs 13.4%, and 17.2% vs 8.6%, respectively; P&lt;.05 for all).

This is a retrospective population-based cohort study of patients with stage IB-IIA invasive cervical cancer reported to the California Cancer Registry from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2009. Adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline care was defined by year- and stage-appropriate surgical procedures, radiation, and chemotherapy. Multivariate logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier estimate, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine associations between patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline adherence and cervical cancer-specific 5-year survival. A total of 6,063 patients were identified. Forty-seven percent received National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline-adherent care, and 18.8% were treated in high-volume centers (20 or more patients/year). On multivariate analysis, lowest socioeconomic status (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.69, 95% CI 0.57-0.84), low-middle socioeconomic status (adjusted OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64-0.92), and Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score 1 or higher (adjusted OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69-0.89) were patient characteristics associated with receipt of nonguideline care. Receiving adherent care was less common in low-volume centers (45.9%) than in high-volume centers (50.9%) (effect size 0.90, 95% CI 0.84-0.96).

Myoma burden and approach to myomectomy were determined based on Current Procedural Terminology coding. Surgical approach and perioperative morbidity were examined in African American, Asian American, and Hispanic American women using non-Hispanic Caucasian women as the referent population. Adjusted means and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CI were calculated using propensity score matching accounting for age, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), myoma burden, preoperative anemia, hypertension, smoking, and operative time. Data were available for 2,533 Caucasian, 3,359 African American, 664 Asian American, and 700 Hispanic American women.

In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed females aged 11-26 years who initiated HPV vaccination from 2008 through 2012 in a community-based health care system in California. Vaccine completion was defined as having received at least three injections. Demographic data including age, race, ethnicity, and language preferences were obtained. Among Hispanic patients, acculturation was categorized as low or high using written and spoken Spanish vs English language as a proxy. Age groups were defined as younger adolescents (11-14 years), teens (15-17 years), and young adults (18-26 years). Bivariate analyses using Ï‡ tests and age-adjusted logistic regression were performed. Among 102,052 females who initiated HPV vaccination, a total of 41,847 (41%) completed the series. Younger adolescents had the highest completion rates (43.4%, P&lt;.001) vs teens and young adults (37.4% and 38.0%, respectively). By race and ethnicity, Asian patients had the highest completion rates (49.5%, 95% CI 48.8-50.2), and the lowest rates were seen among black and Hispanic patients (28.7% [95% CI 27.8-29.6] and 38.9% [95% CI 38.3-39.5], respectively). Among Hispanic patients, the adjusted odds for vaccine completion was 1.2-fold higher for the low acculturated vs the highly acculturated group (adjusted odds ratio 1.23 [95% CI 1.16-1.31]). More than half of the females who initiated HPV vaccination did not complete the series, and black and Hispanic patients were least likely to have completed the series. Among Hispanic patients, the highest acculturated group had the lowest completion rate.

We used weighted multivariable logistic regression and predictive margins to generate prevalence and incidence estimates. Adjusted rate ratios and differences were calculated to quantify disparities across racial and ethnic categories. Subgroup analyses were performed to examine the incidence of severe maternal morbidity among deliveries to women with comorbid physical health conditions, behavioral health conditions, and multiple chronic conditions within each racial and ethnic category. The incidence of severe maternal morbidity was significantly higher among deliveries to women in every racial and ethnic minority category compared with deliveries among non-Hispanic white women. Severe maternal morbidity occurred in 231.1 (95% CI 223.6-238.5) and 139.2 (95% CI 136.4-142.0) per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations among non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white women, respectively (P&lt;.001). When excluding cases in which blood transfusion was the only indicator of severe maternal morbidity, only deliveries to non-Hispanic black women had a higher incidence of severe maternal morbidity compared with deliveries among non-Hispanic white women: 50.2 (95% CI 47.6-52.9) and 40.9 (95% CI 39.6-42.3) per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations, respectively (risk ratio 1.2 [95% CI 1.2-1.3], risk difference 9.3 [95% CI 6.5-12.2] per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations; P&lt;.001 for each comparison).

A cohort study was performed. All patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign indications, recorded in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program and its targeted hysterectomy file in 2015, were identified. The primary exposure was patient race. The primary outcome was route of hysterectomy and the secondary outcome was postoperative complication. Associations were examined using both bivariable tests and logistic regression. Of 15,136 women who underwent hysterectomy for benign indications, 75% were white and 25% were black. Black women were more likely to undergo an open hysterectomy than white women (50.1% vs 22.9%; odds ratio [OR] 3.36, 95% CI 3.11-3.64). Black women had larger uteri (median 262 g vs 123 g; 60.7% vs 25.6% with uterus greater than 250 g), more prior pelvic surgery (58.5% vs 53.2%), and higher body mass indices (32.7 vs 30.4).

We performed a retrospective cohort study of all women who underwent cesarean birth resulting in a liveborn neonate at a single institution between July 1, 2014, and June 30, 2016. Pain scores documented and medications administered after delivery were grouped into 0-24 and 25-48 hours postpartum time periods. Number of pain scores recorded, whether any pain score was 7 of 10 or greater, and analgesic medication administered were calculated. Models were adjusted for propensity scores incorporating maternal age, body mass index, gestational age, nulliparity, primary compared with repeat cesarean delivery, classical hysterotomy, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. A total of 1,987 women were identified, and 1,701 met inclusion criteria. There were 30,984 pain scores documented. Severe pain (7/10 or greater) was more common among black (28%) and Hispanic (22%) women than among women who identified as white (20%) or Asian (15%).

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all deliveries at a single high-volume tertiary care center from December 1, 2015, through November 30, 2016. Women were included if they self-identified as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or Hispanic; were at least 18 years of age; and did not have documented allergies to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or morphine. Medical records were queried for three outcomes: 1) patient-reported postpartum pain score (on a scale of 0-10) at discharge (dichotomized less than 5 or 5 or higher), 2) inpatient opioid dosing during postpartum hospitalization (reported as morphine milligram equivalents [MMEs] per postpartum day), and 3) receipt of an opioid prescription at discharge. The associations between each of these outcomes and maternal race-ethnicity were assessed using multivariable logistic regression models with random effects to account for clustering by discharge physician. A sensitivity analysis was conducted in which women of different race and ethnicity were matched using propensity scores. A total of 9,900 postpartum women were eligible for analysis. Compared with non-Hispanic white women, Hispanic and non-Hispanic black women had significantly greater odds of reporting a pain score of 5 or higher (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.61, 95% 1.26-2.06 and aOR 2.18, 95% 1.63-2.91, respectively) but received significantly fewer inpatient MMEs/d (adjusted Î² -5.03, 95% CI -6.91 to -3.15, and adjusted Î² -3.54, 95% CI -5.88 to -1.20, respectively).

We conducted a retrospective observational descriptive analysis of Louisiana Pregnancy-Associated Mortality Review data of 47 confirmed pregnancy-related deaths occurring from 2011 to 2016. The review team determined cause of death, preventability, and contributing factors. We compared preventability by race-ethnicity and maternal level of care of the facility where death occurred (from level I: basic care to level IV: regional perinatal health center) using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. The rate of pregnancy-related death among non-Hispanic black women (22.7/100,000 births, 95% CI 15.5-32.1, n=32/140,785) was 4.1 times the rate among non-Hispanic white women (5.6/100,000, 95% CI 2.8-10.0, n=11/197,630).

This was a retrospective population-based study of stage I-IV invasive epithelial ovarian cancer reported to the California Cancer Registry between 1996 and 2014. A fit logistic regression model, which was risk-adjusted for patient and disease characteristics, was used to calculate the observed/expected ratio for each hospital, stratified by hospital annual case volume. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for survival analyses, and a multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify independent predictors of access to high-performing hospitals. The study population included 30,051 patients who were treated at 426 hospitals: low observed/expected ratio (n=304) 23.5% of cases; intermediate observed/expected ratio (n=92) 57.8% of cases; and high observed/expected ratio (n=30) 18.7% of cases. Hospitals with high observed/expected ratios were significantly more likely to deliver guideline-adherent care (53.3%), compared with hospitals with intermediate (37.8%) and low (27.5%) observed/expected ratios (P&lt;.001). Median disease-specific survival time ranged from 73.0 months for hospitals with high observed/expected ratios to 48.1 months for hospitals with low observed/expected ratios (P&lt;.001). Treatment at a hospital with a high observed/expected ratio was an independent predictor of superior survival compared with hospitals with intermediate (hazard ratio [HR] 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11, P&lt;.05) and low (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.04-1.16, P&lt;.001) observed/expected ratios. Being of Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio [OR] 0.85, 95% CI 0.78-0.93, P&lt;.001, compared with white), having Medicare insurance (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.68-0.81 P&lt;.001, compared with managed care), having a Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 2 or greater (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-0.99, P&lt;.05), and being of lower socioeconomic status (lowest quintile OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.36-0.46, P&lt;.001, compared with highest quintile) were independent negative predictors of access to a hospital with a high observed/expected ratio. Ovarian cancer care at a hospital with a high observed/expected ratio is an independent predictor of improved survival. Barriers to high-performing hospitals disproportionately affect patients according to sociodemographic characteristics. Triage of patients with suspected ovarian cancer according to a performance-based observed/expected ratio hospital classification is a potential mechanism for expanded access to expert care.","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; California; Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Guideline Adherence; Healthcare Disparities; Hispanic Americans; Hospitals, High-Volume; Humans; Logistic Models; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Proportional Hazards Models; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Young Adult","To validate the observed/expected ratio for adherence to ovarian cancer treatment guidelines as a risk-adjusted measure of hospital quality care, and to identify patient characteristics associated with disparities in access to high-performing hospitals",CA,1996,2014,Retrospective Cohort,California Cancer Registry; California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development databse,Non-Hispanic white,19059,Non-Hispanic black,1424,Hispanic,5785,Asian or Pacific Islander,3582,Native American or unknown,201,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We performed a population-based cohort study of all women who had singleton live births after undergoing induction of labor from 32 0/7 to 42 6/7 weeks of gestation in the United States from 2012 to 2016. The primary objective was to build a predictive model estimating the probability of cesarean delivery after induction of labor using antenatal factors obtained from de-identified U.S. live-birth records. Multivariable logistic regression estimated the association of these factors on risk of cesarean delivery. K-fold cross validation was performed for internal validation of the model, followed by external validation using a separate live-birth cohort from 2017. A publicly available online calculator was developed after validation and calibration were performed for individual risk assessment. The seven variables selected for inclusion in the model by magnitude of influence were prior vaginal delivery, maternal weight at delivery, maternal height, maternal age, prior cesarean delivery, gestational age at induction, and maternal race. From 2012 to 2016, there were 19,844,580 live births in the United States, of which 4,177,644 women with singleton gestations underwent induction of labor. Among these women, 800,423 (19.2%) delivered by cesarean. The receiver operating characteristic curve for the seven-variable model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.787 (95% CI 0.786-0.788). External validation demonstrated a consistent measure of discrimination with an AUC of 0.783 (95% CI 0.764-0.802). This validated predictive model uses seven variables that were obtainable from the patient's medical record and discriminates between women at increased or decreased risk of cesarean delivery after induction of labor.

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of survey data from 107,921 women in 40 states participating in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System from 2015 to 2017. We calculated unadjusted estimates of insurance status at preconception, delivery, and postpartum and continuity across these time points for seven racial-ethnic categories (white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, indigenous, Asian or Pacific Islander, Hispanic Spanish-speaking, Hispanic English-speaking, and mixed race or other). We also examined unadjusted estimates of uninsurance at each perinatal time period by state of residence. We calculated adjusted differences in the predicted probability of uninsurance at preconception, delivery, and postpartum using logistic regression models with interaction terms for race-ethnicity and income. For each perinatal time point, all categories of racial-ethnic minority women experienced higher rates of uninsurance than white non-Hispanic women. From preconception to postpartum, 75.3% (95% CI 74.7-75.8) of white non-Hispanic women had continuous insurance compared with 55.4% of black non-Hispanic women (95% CI 54.2-56.6), 49.9% of indigenous women (95% CI 46.8-53.0) and 20.5% of Hispanic Spanish-speaking women (95% CI 18.9-22.2). In adjusted models, lower-income Hispanic women and indigenous women had a significantly higher predicted probability of uninsurance in the preconception and postpartum period compared with white non-Hispanic women.

We conducted a retrospective study on neonates born at 776 U.S. centers that participated in the Vermont Oxford Network (2006-2017) with a gestational age of 22-25 weeks. The primary outcome was postnatal life support. Secondary outcomes included maternal administration of antenatal corticosteroids and cesarean delivery. We examined rates and 99% CI of the three outcomes by region. We also calculated the adjusted relative risks (aRRs) and 99% CIs for the three outcomes by race and ethnicity within each region using modified Poisson regression models with robust variance estimation. Major regional variation exists in the use of the three interventions at 22 and 23 weeks of gestation but not at 24 and 25 weeks. For example, at 22 weeks of gestation, rates of life support in the South (38.3%; 99% CI 36.3-40.2) and the Midwest (32.7%; 99% CI 30.4-35.0) were higher than in the Northeast (20.2%; 99% CI 17.6-22.8) and the West (22.2%; 99% CI 20.0-24.4).

This is a retrospective analysis of a hospital-level severe maternal morbidity review that occurred in 2018 (n=408) compared with all 2018 Illinois live births (n=141,595), inclusive of any severe maternal morbidity cases resulting in a live birth before hospital discharge. Cases were chosen for review based on completeness of records, complexity of the case, or an assessment that cases presented opportunities for learning and quality improvement; ie, not all severe maternal morbidity cases were reviewed. We present descriptive characteristics that contributed to the severe maternal morbidity event, and health care professional, system, and patient opportunities to alter the severe maternal morbidity outcome. A total of 408 severe maternal morbidity cases were reviewed. Women with severe maternal morbidity were more likely to be non-Hispanic Black, multiparous, aged 35 years or older, have public insurance, and receive inadequate prenatal care. The most common causes of severe maternal morbidity were hemorrhage (48%), and preeclampsia and eclampsia (20%). Overall, 42% of severe maternal morbidity cases had opportunities to improve care. Non-Hispanic Black women had a disproportionately high burden of severe maternal morbidity due to preeclampsia and eclampsia (31% vs 18.1%) and were more likely to need improvement in care compared with non-Hispanic White women (53% vs 39.0%). The most common opportunities to alter the severe maternal morbidity outcome were health care professional factors during the intrapartum (9%) and postpartum (10%) periods. Standardized severe maternal morbidity review gives a fuller view of the state of maternal health and highlights opportunities to improve quality of care.","Adult; Blood Transfusion; Failure to Rescue, Health Care; Female; Humans; Illinois; Intensive Care Units; Maternal Health; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult","To address rising rates of severe maternal morbidity and persistent racial disparities, Illinois established severe maternal morbidity review in all obstetric hospitals",IL,2018,2018,Retrospective Cohort,Illinois Department of Public Health Office of Women’s Health and Family Services Facility-level severe maternal morbidity review,Non-Hispanic White,192,Non-Hispanic Black,98,Hispanic,74,Asian,20,Non-Hispanic other-multi-race,8,Unknown or missing,16,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

We performed a planned secondary analysis of a randomized trial by comparing treatments for medical management of early pregnancy loss. We hypothesized that Black participants would have higher odds of risk for major depression (measured with the CES-D [Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression] scale) 30 days after early pregnancy loss treatment when compared with non-Black participants. We analyzed the data as a cohort, with the primary exposure being race and secondary exposure being high adverse childhood experience scores (measured with the Adverse Childhood Experience scale). Our primary outcome was risk for major depression (score of 21 or higher on the CES-D scale) 30 days after early pregnancy loss treatment. Three hundred participants diagnosed with a nonviable intrauterine pregnancy from 5 to 12 weeks of gestation were randomized as part of the original trial from May 2014 to April 2017. Of 275 respondents included in this analysis, 120 [44%] self-identified as Black and 155 [56%] self-identified as non-Black. After early pregnancy loss treatment, 65 [24%] participants were at risk for major depression. Black participants had an increased risk for major depression (57%) after early pregnancy loss treatment compared with non-Black participants (43%; odds ratio [OR] 2.02; 95% CI 1.15-3.55). After adjustment for risk for baseline depression, adverse childhood experience score, and parity, the odds of risk for major depression 30 days after pregnancy loss treatment remained higher for Black participants when compared with non-Black participants (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.15-3.55; adjusted OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.28-4.81). Overall, approximately one quarter of women who experience an early pregnancy loss are at an increased risk for major depression 30 days after treatment. This risk is about twice as high for Black women compared with non-Black women. There is a need for appropriate mental health resources for women undergoing early pregnancy loss care.

We accessed MilCanEpi, which links data from the Department of Defense Central Cancer Registry and Military Health System Data Repository administrative claims data, to identify a cohort of women aged 18-79 years who were diagnosed with uterine, cervical, or ovarian cancer between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2014. Information on tumor stage, grade, and histology was used to determine which treatment(s) (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) was indicated for each patient according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines during the period of the data (1998-2014). We compared non-Hispanic Black, Asian, and Hispanic women with non-Hispanic White women in their likelihood to receive guideline-adherent treatment using multivariable logistic regression models given as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs. The study included 3,354 women diagnosed with a gynecologic cancer of whom 68.7% were non-Hispanic White, 15.6% Asian, 9.0% non-Hispanic Black, and 6.7% Hispanic. Overall, 77.8% of patients received guideline-adherent treatment (79.1% non-Hispanic White, 75.9% Asian, 69.3% non-Hispanic Black, and 80.5% Hispanic).

We conducted an analysis on a population-based retrospective cohort study using 2010-2014 birth records linked with hospital discharge data in New York City. A multivariable logistic regression mediation model on a subgroup of the sample consisting of normal-weight and obese women (n=409,021) calculated the mediation effect of obesity in the association between maternal race-ethnicity and severe maternal morbidity, and the residual effect not mediated by obesity. A sensitivity analysis was conducted excluding the severe maternal morbidity cases due to blood transfusion. Among 591,455 live births, we identified 15,158 cases of severe maternal morbidity (256.3/10,000 deliveries). The severe maternal morbidity rate among obese women was higher than that of normal-weight women (342 vs 216/10,000 deliveries). Black women had a severe maternal morbidity rate nearly three times higher than White women (420 vs 146/10,000 deliveries) and the severe maternal morbidity rate among Latinas was nearly twice that of White women (285/10,000 deliveries). Among women with normal or obese body mass index (BMI) only (n=409,021), Black race was strongly associated with severe maternal morbidity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.02, 95% CI 2.88-3.17) but the obesity-mediated effect represented only 3.2% of the total association (aOR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.05). Latina ethnicity was also associated with severe maternal morbidity (aOR 2.01, 95% CI 1.90-2.12) and the obesity-mediated effect was similarly small: 3.4% of the total association (aOR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03). In a sensitivity analysis excluding blood transfusion, severe maternal morbidity cases found a higher mediation effect of obesity in the association with Black race and Latina ethnicity (15.3% and 15.2% of the total association, respectively).

This was a retrospective cohort study using administrative data. Data for delivery hospitalizations with severe maternal morbidity, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were abstracted from the 1999-2017 National Inpatient Sample. Race and ethnicity were categorized into non-Hispanic White (reference), non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, other, and missing. The outcome was failure to rescue from severe maternal morbidity. Disparities were assessed using the failure-to-rescue rate ratio (ratio of the failure-to-rescue rate in the racial and minority group to the failure-to-rescue rate in White women), adjusted for patient and hospital characteristics. Temporal trends in severe maternal morbidity and failure to rescue were assessed. During the study period, 73,934,559 delivery hospitalizations were identified, including 993,864 with severe maternal morbidity (13.4/1,000; 95% CI 13.3-13.5). Among women with severe maternal morbidity, 4,328 died (4.3/1,000; 95% CI 4.2-4.5). The adjusted failure-to-rescue rate ratio was 1.79 (95% CI 1.77-1.81) for Black women, 1.39 (95% CI 1.37-1.41) for women of other race and ethnicity, 1.43 (95% CI 1.42-1.45) for women with missing race and ethnicity data, and 1.08 (95% CI 1.06-1.09) for Hispanic women. During the study period, the severe maternal morbidity rate increased significantly in each of the five racial and ethnic groups but started declining in 2012. Meanwhile, the failure-to-rescue rate decreased significantly during the entire study period.

We used 1980-2007 national birth and death certificate data to calculate ectopic pregnancy mortality ratios (deaths per 100,000 live births) overall and stratified by maternal age and race. We performed nonparametric tests for trend to assess changes in ectopic pregnancy mortality over time and calculated projected mortality ratios for 2013-2017. Ectopic pregnancy deaths among hospitalized women were identified from 1998-2007 Nationwide Inpatient Sample data. Between 1980 and 2007, 876 deaths were attributed to ectopic pregnancy. The ectopic pregnancy mortality ratio declined by 56.6%, from 1.15 to 0.50 deaths per 100,000 live births between 1980-1984 and 2003-2007; at the current average annual rate of decline, this ratio will further decrease by 28.5% to 0.36 ectopic pregnancy deaths per 100,000 live births by 2013-2017. The ectopic pregnancy mortality ratio was 6.8 times higher for African Americans than whites and 3.5 times higher for women older than 35 years than those younger than 25 years during 2003-2007. Of the 76 deaths among women hospitalized between 1998 and 2007, 70.5% were tubal pregnancies; salpingectomy was performed in 80.6% of cases. Excessive hemorrhage, shock, or renal failure accompanied 67.4% of ectopic pregnancy deaths among hospitalized women. Despite a significant decline in ectopic pregnancy mortality since the 1980s, age disparities, and especially racial disparities, persist. Strategies to ensure timely diagnosis and management of ectopic pregnancies can further reduce related mortality and age and race mortality gaps.","African Americans; Cause of Death; Databases, Factual; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Humans; Maternal Age; Mortality; Pregnancy; Pregnancy, Ectopic; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; United States",To estimate trends in ectopic pregnancy mortality and examine characteristics of recently hospitalized women who died as a result of ectopic pregnancy in the United States,USA,1980,2007,Registry,National Vital Statistics System; healthcare cost and utilization project,White,-99,African American,-99,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

We analyzed 46,329,018 singleton live births using the National Center for Health Statistics U.S. period-linked birth and infant death data from 1995 to 2006. Infant mortality rates, neonatal mortality rates, and postneonatal mortality rates were calculated according to gestational age, race and ethnicity, and cause of death. Overall, infant mortality rates have decreased for early-term and full-term births between 1995 and 2006. At 37 weeks of gestation, Hispanics had the greatest decline in infant mortality rates (35.4%; 4.8 per 1,000 to 3.1 per 1,000) followed by 22.4% for whites (4.9 per 1,000 to 3.8 per 1,000); blacks had the smallest decline (6.8%; 5.9 per 1,000 to 5.5 per 1,000) as a result of a stagnant neonatal mortality rate. At 37 weeks compared with 40 weeks of gestation, neonatal mortality rates increase. For Hispanics, the relative risk is 2.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-3.3); for whites, the relative risk is 2.6 (95% CI 2.2-3.1); and for blacks, the relative risk is 2.9 (95% CI 2.2-3.8). Neonatal mortality rates are still increased at 38 weeks of gestation. At both early- and full-term gestations, neonatal mortality rates for blacks are 40% higher than for whites and postneonatal mortality rates 80% higher, whereas Hispanics have a reduced postneonatal mortality rate when compared with whites.

A retrospective cohort study. An obstetric teaching hospital between 2007 and 2017. A total of 89Â 681 delivery hospitalisations. We created and evaluated two models, one predicting CSMM at delivery (delivery model) and the other predicting CSMM postpartum following discharge from delivery hospitalisation (postpartum CSMM). We assessed model discrimination and calibration and used bootstrapping for internal validation. Cardiovascular severe maternal morbidity comprised the following confirmed conditions: pulmonary oedema/acute heart failure, myocardial infarction, aneurysm, cardiac arrest/ventricular fibrillation, heart failure/arrest during surgery or procedure, cerebrovascular disorders, cardiogenic shock, conversion of cardiac rhythm and difficult-to-control severe hypertension. The delivery model contained 11 variables and 3 interaction terms. The strongest predictors were gestational hypertension, chronic hypertension, multiple gestation, cardiac lesions or valvular heart disease, maternal age â‰¥40Â years and history of poor pregnancy outcome.

This was a secondary analysis of nuMoM2b (Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be), a prospective observational cohort study. Our primary exposure was dichotomous high allostatic load in the first trimester, defined as 4 or more of 12 biomarkers in the ""worst"" quartile. The primary outcome was a composite adverse pregnancy outcome: hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), and stillbirth. Secondary outcomes included components of the composite. Multivariable logistic regression was used to test the association between high allostatic load and adverse pregnancy outcomes, adjusted for potential confounders. Mediation and moderation analyses were conducted to assess the role of allostatic load along the causal pathway between racial disparities and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Among 4,266 individuals, 34.7% had a high allostatic load. Composite adverse pregnancy outcome occurred in 1,171 (27.5%): 14.0% HDP, 8.6% preterm birth (48.0% spontaneous and 52.2% indicated), 11.0% SGA, and 0.3% stillbirth. After adjustment for maternal age, gravidity, smoking, bleeding in the first trimester, and health insurance, high allostatic load was significantly associated with a composite adverse pregnancy outcome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.5, 95% CI 1.3, 1.7) and HDP (aOR 2.5, 95% CI 2.0-2.9), but not preterm birth or SGA.

The association between allostatic load and HDP differed by self-reported race, but not for a composite adverse pregnancy outcome, preterm birth, or SGA. High allostatic load in the first trimester is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly HDP. Allostatic load was a partial mediator between race and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The association between allostatic load and HDP differed by self-reported race.","Infant, Newborn; Female; Pregnancy; Humans; Pregnancy Outcome; Allostasis; Stillbirth; Prospective Studies; Premature Birth; Pre-Eclampsia; Fetal Growth Retardation; Infant, Newborn, Diseases",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

In a population-level analysis study, we analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Health Statistics database and the Detailed Mortality Underlying Cause of Death database (CDC WONDER) that contains mortality and population counts for all U.S. counties. Bivariate correlations between maternal mortality ratio and all maternal demographic, lifestyle, health, and medical service utilization characteristics were calculated. We performed a maximum likelihood factor analysis with varimax rotation retaining variables that were significant (P&lt;.05) in the univariate analysis to deal with multicollinearity among the existing variables. The United States has experienced a continued increase in maternal mortality ratio since 2007 with rates of 21-22 per 100,000 live births in 2013 and 2014. This increase in mortality was most dramatic in non-Hispanic black women. There was a significant correlation between state mortality ranking and the percentage of non-Hispanic black women in the delivery population. Cesarean deliveries, unintended births, unmarried status, percentage of non-Hispanic black deliveries, and four or less prenatal visits were significantly (P&lt;.05) associated with increased maternal mortality ratio. Interstate differences in maternal mortality ratios largely reflect a different proportion of non-Hispanic black or unmarried patients with unplanned pregnancies. Racial disparities in health care availability, access, or utilization by underserved populations are an important issue faced by states in seeking to decrease maternal mortality.","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.; Ethnic Groups; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Maternal Mortality; Maternal-Child Health Services; Perinatal Care; Pregnancy; United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Patients with EC were identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2005 to 2011. AA and W subgroups were studied. Multivariable logistic regression models were performed. Of 3248 patients, 2899 (89%) W and 349 (11%) AA were identified. AA were more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, ascites, neurologic morbidities, weight loss, non-independent functional status, higher ASA class, higher serum creatinine â‰¥ 2 mg/dl, hypoalbuminemia and anemia. Laparoscopic surgery was performed less frequently in AA than W (41.4% vs. 50.3%, p&lt;0.001). AA had a significantly higher risk of postoperative complications than W (21% vs. 12%, p&lt;0.001) including surgical (17% vs. 10%, p&lt;0.001) and non-surgical complications (7% vs. 4%, p=0.022). Mean length of hospital stay and operative time were longer in AA than W but there was no difference in surgical re-exploration. In multivariable model after adjustment for confounders including surgical complexity and associated morbidities, AA race was not an independent predictor of &quot;any postoperative complications&quot; for both laparotomy group (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.73-1.61, p=0.65) and laparoscopic group (OR 1.43, 95% CI 0.80-2.45, p=0.21). No difference in 30-day mortality was found between AA and W (1% vs. 1%, p=0.11). AA patients with EC have more preoperative morbidities, postoperative complications and were less likely to undergo minimally invasive surgery. However, AA race was not an independent predictor of poor 30-day outcomes after controlling for other confounders.","African American; Endometrial cancer; Morbidity and Mortality; Race; Surgery; White; African Americans; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Endometrial Neoplasms; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Time Factors",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
