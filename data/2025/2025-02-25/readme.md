# Academic Literature on Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Reproductive Medicine in the US

This week we're exploring data on studies investigating racial and ethnic disparities in reproductive medicine as published in the eight highest impact peer-reviewed Ob/Gyn journals from January 1, 2010 through June 30, 2023. The data were collected as part of a review article [Racial and ethnic disparities in reproductive medicine in the United States: a narrative review of contemporary high-quality evidence](https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(24)00775-0/fulltext) published in the *American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology* in January 2025.  

> "There has been increasing debate around how or if race and ethnicity should be used in medical researchâ€”including the conceptualization of race as a biological entity, a social construct, or a proxy for racism. The objectives of this narrative review are to identify and synthesize reported racial and ethnic inequalities in obstetrics and gynecology (ob/gyn) and develop informed recommendations for racial and ethnic inequity research in ob/gyn."

A companion [interactive website](https://obgyn-shiny.shinyapps.io/obgyn-disp/) was published alongside the review article, and the data has also been used by college students to create [data art](https://katcorr.github.io/this-art-is-HARD/) to raise awareness about this research.   

The data provides an opportunity to critically examine how racial and ethnic disparities in reproductive medicine are framed, measured, and discussed in the academic literature. 

- Explore how race and ethnicity are categorized in these articles. Which categories are most prominent? Which are missing? How do sample sizes vary across groups?
- Has the sentiment of article titles, abstracts, keywords, and/or aims statements changed over time?  
- What type of health outcomes have been studied? What disparities have been identified? 


Thank you to [Kat Correia from Amherst College](https://github.com/katcorr) for curating this week's dataset.

## The Data

```r
# Using R
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR R package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-02-25')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 8)

article_dat <- tuesdata$article_dat
model_dat <- tuesdata$model_dat

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

article_dat <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-25/article_dat.csv')
model_dat <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-25/model_dat.csv')
```

```python
# Using Python
# Option 1: PyDyTuesday python library
## pip install PyDyTuesday

import PyDyTuesday

# Download files from the week, which you can then read in locally
PyDyTuesday.get_date('2025-02-25')

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub and assign to an object

article_dat = pandas.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-25/article_dat.csv')
model_dat = pandas.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-25/model_dat.csv')
```

## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) report, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R, Python, or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
- [Submit your own dataset!](../../../.github/pr_instructions.md)

### Cleaning Script

```r
# Clean data provided by Kat Correia. Student interns extracted this information
# from reproductive medicine journals using duplicate data entry. 
# After duplicate data entry discrepancies were resolved, their 
# individual files were combined, and posted for public access 
# as Google sheets, e.g.,:

# No additional cleaning was necessary.
