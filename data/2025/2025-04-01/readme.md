# Pokemon

This week we are exploring Pokemon! This dataset is sourced from {pokemon} ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pokemon) | [github](https://github.com/williamorim/pokemon)), an R package which provides Pokemon information in both English and Brazilian Portuguese.

> This package provides a dataset of Pokemon information in both English and Brazilian Portuguese. The dataset contains 949 rows and 22 columns, including information such as the Pokemonâ€™s name, ID, height, weight, stats, type, and more.


Thank you to [Frank Hull](https://github.com/frankiethull) for curating this week's dataset.

## The Data

```r
# Using R
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR R package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-04-01')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 13)

pokemon_df <- tuesdata$pokemon_df

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

pokemon_df <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-04-01/pokemon_df.csv')
```

```python
# Using Python
# Option 1: pydytuesday python library
## pip install pydytuesday

import pydytuesday

# Download files from the week, which you can then read in locally
pydytuesday.get_date('2025-04-01')

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub and assign to an object

pokemon_df = pandas.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-04-01/pokemon_df.csv')
```


## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) report, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R, Python, or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
- [Submit your own dataset!](../../../pr_instructions.md)
