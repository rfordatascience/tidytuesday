    Image shows faceted scatterplots of pokemon dataset.
    Attack is on the x-axis, and defense is on the y-axis.
    The primary pokemon color is indicated with the color of the points, and the
    charts are faceted by pokemon type.
    The breakdown highlights a somewhat linear relationship between attack and
    defense for most pokemon types.
    For the most part, they are correlated, with defense and attack increasing
    together.
    There is less variance between the two variables when type is "dragon",
    "electric", or "normal".
    Noticeable types that break this trend are "rock" type pokemon.
    In addition, there are a few outliers, such as a "bug" type with a near-zero
    attack and defense above 200 hp.
