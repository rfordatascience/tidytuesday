    Scatterplot titled 'Flipper and bill length' showing the relationship
    between flipper length (x-axis, in mm) and bill length (y-axis, in mm) for
    three penguin species at Palmer Station LTER. Adelie penguins are
    represented by orange circles with a slight positive trend line. Chinstrap
    penguins are shown with purple triangles, clustering higher on the bill
    length axis and a steeper trend line. Gentoo penguins are shown with dark
    green squares, positioned farther right along the flipper length axis, with
    their own upward trend line. A legend at the bottom right indicates the
    color and shape used for each species. The image is from the palmerpenguins
    R package.
