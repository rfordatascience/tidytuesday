Weighting of provisional counts is done to account for potential underreporting in the most recent time periods. However, data for the most recent time periods are still likely to be incomplete. Only about 60% of deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death. The completeness of provisional data varies by cause of death and by age group. However, the weights applied do not account for this variability. Therefore, the predicted numbers of deaths may be too low for some age groups. For example, provisional data on deaths among younger age groups is typically less complete than among older age groups. Predicted counts may therefore be too low among the younger age groups. Numbers in 2020 and 2021 are compared with the average numbers from the same quarters in 2015-2019.

Please refer to the following MMWR for more information on methods: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7024e2.htm *Vaccine Safety Datalink is a collaboration between CDC’s Immunization Safety Office and nine integrated health care organizations in seven U.S. states; eight sites provide data and one additional site provides subject matter expertise. For more information please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vsd/index.html. Cumulative vaccination data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink were first reported to CDC on March 13, 2021, and included vaccines administered since December 14, 2020; thus, data reported during December 14, 2020–March 12, 2021, could not be shared by week. Please note that the COVID-19 vaccination coverage rates for pregnant people reported on CDC’s COVID Data Tracker changed from a cumulative estimate of pregnant persons receiving at least one dose of COVID vaccine to a weekly estimate of those who were fully vaccinated on January 20, 2022. The cumulative data included the vaccination status of all individuals who were identified as pregnant anytime since December 2020, when COVID-19 vaccines were first authorized under emergency use. Even if the individuals were no longer pregnant or included in the Vaccine Safety Datalink system, they remained part of the denominator. Additionally, for those pregnant people who did not get a vaccine between December 2020 and April 2021 – a time when vaccine eligibility was limited and some populations were prioritized – they were counted in the cumulative data as unvaccinated, lowering the coverage rates.

For a 95% confidence interval, if the sampling method is repeated many times, the true value would fall within this interval at least 95% of the time. Wider CIs reflect larger random error in estimates resulting from survey sampling. Estimates from the NIS-ACM may differ from estimates based on other data sources, and in addition to random error associated with taking a sample, are subject to errors resulting from incomplete sample frame (exclusion of households without cell phones), selection bias (survey respondents may be more likely to be vaccinated than non-respondents), and errors in self-reported vaccination status. Estimates are weighted to selected sociodemographic characteristics of the U.S. population to reduce possible bias from incomplete sample frame and selection bias. National estimates include 50 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands.

For data collected August 18 through September 30, 2024, only intent estimates are available. Parent-reported receipt of nirsevimab by infants were collected starting October 1, 2024. Confidence Intervals (CIs) describe the level of uncertainty around an estimate because a sample was taken. 95% CIs represent the range of values that would result if the data collection had been repeated many times. For a 95% confidence interval, if the sampling method is repeated many times, the true value would fall within this interval at least 95% of the time. Wider CIs reflect larger random error in estimates resulting from survey sampling. Estimates from the NIS–ACM may differ from estimates based on other data sources, and in addition to random error associated with taking a sample, are subject to errors resulting from incomplete sample frame (exclusion of households without cell phones), selection bias (survey respondents may be more likely to be vaccinated than non-respondents), and errors in self-reported vaccination status. Estimates are weighted to selected sociodemographic characteristics of the U.S. population to reduce possible bias from incomplete sample frame and selection bias. Receipt of RSV vaccination during pregnancy was assessed by the NIS-ACM questionnaire among females 18–49 years who reported having an infant born since October 1, 2024. For infants born April 1, 2024, through September 30, 2024, maternal RSV vaccination was not assessed, and these infants were assumed to be protected against RSV only if infant was reported to have received nirsevimab. The estimates of receipt of RSV vaccination during pregnancy for infants born since April 1, 2024, are not an assessment of maternal RSV vaccination coverage among pregnant persons eligible for vaccination as shown with the Vaccine Safety Datalink (https://www.cdc.gov/rsvvaxview/dashboard/pregnant-persons-coverage.html), as they are based on all infants eligible for nirsevimab or maternal vaccination rather than eligible pregnancies (https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/hcp/vaccine-clinical-guidance/pregnant-people.html). Estimates of nirsevimab receipt by infants born since April 1, 2024, include those who were born shortly before or are entering their first RSV season and do not account for the mother’s RSV vaccination status during pregnancy (Healthcare Providers: RSV Immunization for Children 19 Months and Younger | CDC, https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/rsv/hcp/child.html). Intent for nirsevimab receipt is assessed among infants who had not received nirsevimab and whose mother did not receive RSV vaccination during pregnancy. National estimates include 50 states, Washington D.C., Guam, and Puerto Rico. Estimates are based on interviews conducted during Sunday through Saturday weeks assigned to the monthly analytic period, which may include some dates in the month before or after the specified analytic month. Unlike the weekly RSV vaccination coverage estimates, they are not cumulative estimates based on all interviews conducted to date.",Public Domain U.S. Government,https://www.cdc.gov/respvaxview/about/,NA,"United States- National, Region, State",2024-2025,monthly,NA,https://www.cdc.gov/rsvvaxview/,NA,"National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Confidence Intervals (CI) describe the level of uncertainty around an estimate because a sample was taken. 95% CIs represent the range of values that would result if the data collection had been repeated many times. For a 95% confidence interval, if the sampling method is repeated many times, the true value would fall within this interval at least 95% of the time. Wider CIs reflect larger random error in estimates resulting from survey sampling. Estimates from the NIS-ACM may differ from estimates based on other data sources, and in addition to random error associated with taking a sample, are subject to errors resulting from incomplete sample frame (exclusion of households without cell phones), selection bias (survey respondents may be more likely to be vaccinated than non-respondents), and errors in self-reported vaccination status. Estimates are weighted to selected sociodemographic characteristics of the U.S. population to reduce possible bias from incomplete sample frame and selection bias.

Data are weighted to represent the non-institutionalized U.S. population and mitigate possible bias that can result from incomplete sample frames (e.g., exclusion of households with no phone service or only landline telephones) or non-response. Survey weights were also calibrated to jurisdiction-level vaccine administration data reported to CDC for data collected before September 2023. All responses are self-reported. For more information about the survey, see the NIS website at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/nis/about.html#current-surveys. Estimates from NIS-ACM are subject to random error related to taking a sample (see definition of confidence interval below), and to possible systematic errors. Systematic errors can result from incomplete sample frame (exclusion of households without cell phones), selection bias (survey respondents may be more likely to be vaccinated than non-respondents), and errors in self or parental reported vaccination status. Estimates are weighted to selected sociodemographic characteristics of the U.S. population to reduce possible bias from incomplete sample frame and selection bias. Estimates from the NIS-ACM may differ from estimates based on other data sources. Monthly estimates from NIS-ACM on this dashboard are based on proportions derived from the interviews that occurred only during the weeks assigned to the monthly analytic period. Due to sampling variability, once coverage reaches a plateau, minor fluctuations in estimates may result in coverage appearing to decrease from the month prior. These monthly estimates of vaccination coverage may differ from weekly estimates of vaccination coverage from NIS-ACM available on the Vaccination Trends – Adults (cdc.gov) at https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data-research/dashboard/vaccination-trends-adults.html and the Weekly COVID-19 Vaccination Dashboard | COVIDVaxView | CDC at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/covidvaxview/interactive/vaccination-dashboard.html, in which estimates of coverage are calculated for weekly data collection periods using a composite estimation procedure that uses data from completed interviews from the current week combined with data from all prior weeks, and are non-decreasing over time. Estimates for vaccination intent are based on interviews conducted each respective week and are adjusted to the cumulative vaccination coverage estimate for that week. Estimates calculated from a sample size of <30 are not shown. Approximately 14,000-17,000 adults are surveyed each week; sample size varies by demographic subgroup.

Data are weighted to represent the non-institutionalized U.S. population of children and adolescents ages 6 months – 17 years and to mitigate possible bias that can result from incomplete sample frames (e.g., exclusion of households with no phone service or only landline telephones) or non-response. The NIS-CCM survey weights adjust for nonresponse and households without mobile telephones. All responses are reported by the parent or guardian for their age-eligible child or adolescent. For more information about the survey, see the NIS website at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/nis/about.html#current-surveys. Estimates from NIS-CCM are subject to random error related to taking a sample (see definition of confidence interval below), and possible systematic errors. Systematic errors can result from incomplete sample frame (exclusion of households without cell phones), selection bias (survey respondents may be more likely to be vaccinated than non-respondents), and errors in self or parental reported vaccination status. Estimates are weighted to selected sociodemographic characteristics of the U.S. population to reduce possible bias from incomplete sample frame and selection bias. Estimates from the NIS-CCM may differ from estimates based on other data sources. Monthly estimates from NIS-CCM on this dashboard are based on proportions derived from the interviews that occurred only during the weeks assigned to the monthly analytic period. Due to sampling variability, once coverage reaches a plateau, minor fluctuations in estimates may result in coverage appearing to decrease from the month prior. These monthly estimates of vaccination coverage may differ from weekly estimates of vaccination coverage from NIS-ACM available here: https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data-research/dashboard/vaccination-trends-adults.html and https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/covidvaxview/interactive/vaccination-dashboard.html, in which estimates of coverage are calculated for weekly data collection periods using a composite estimation procedure that uses data from completed interviews from the current week combined with data from all prior weeks, and are non-decreasing over time.

These data exclude antigen, antibody, and at-home test results. Test positivity data are only available at the national and HHS Region level. All data are provisional and subject to change. Reporting is less complete for the past 1 week, and more complete for data reported for the period 2 weeks earlier (>90%). Because the data are from a sentinel network of laboratories, results may vary geographically. The data do not include all test results within a jurisdiction and therefore may not reflect all, COVID-19 NAATs in the United States. There are data from all states across the 10 HHS regions. Percent positivity is one of the metrics used to monitor COVID-19 transmission over time and by area. Percent positivity is calculated by dividing the number of positive NAATs by the total number of NAATs administered, then multiplying by 100 [(# of positive NAAT tests / total NAAT tests) x 100]. The data represent laboratory tests performed, not individual people. In the table and upon hovering on the map, the total test counts in the data reflect the latest reported data from NREVSS laboratories and may not match the data presented by various jurisdictions. On May 11, 2023 CDC discontinued utilizing the COVID electronic laboratory reporting (CELR) platform as the primary laboratory source of COVID-19 results. These data are archived at health.data.gov.

The two vendors (Ipsos and NORC) use probability-based panels to survey a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults aged ≥18 years. Panel members complete the surveys online. Samples are drawn using an address-based sampling methodology, and data are weighted to represent the non-institutionalized U.S. population and mitigate possible non-response bias. Each month, CDC funds twenty questions, in addition to demographic variables, to be fielded on two survey waves for each panel, for a total of four survey waves. A representative sample is selected for each general adult population survey wave from the respective panels. All responses are self-reported.

For a 95% confidence interval, if the sampling method is repeated many times, the true value would fall within this interval at least 95% of the time. Wider CIs reflect larger random error in estimates resulting from survey sampling. Estimates from the NIS-ACM may differ from estimates based on other data sources, and in addition to random error associated with taking a sample, are subject to errors resulting from incomplete sample frame (exclusion of households without cell phones), selection bias (survey respondents may be more likely to be vaccinated than non-respondents), and errors in self-reported vaccination status. Estimates are weighted to selected sociodemographic characteristics of the U.S. population to reduce possible bias from incomplete sample frame and selection bias. National estimates include 50 states, Washington D.C., Guam, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands (included in 2023 and 2025 calendar years).

Each week, estimates for prior weeks are recalculated using the additional interviews conducted that week (combined with all previous interviews). Cumulative vaccination coverage estimates are suppressed when the cumulative sample size is <30 or current week sample size is <5. Vaccination intent estimates for a given week are suppressed when the sample size for that week is <30.
