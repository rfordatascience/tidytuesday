Daniel Woodie,Eli Lilly & Company,regular,Developing a prototyping competency in a statistical science organization,Building effective data science teams,2023-09-19,2023-09-19T15:40:00Z,20,"The introduction of new tools, methods, and processes can be a struggle within a statistical science organization. Being deliberate and investing in the creation of a prototyping competency can help in accelerating progress. Prototyping allows organizations to quickly experiment with new ideas, reduce the risk of failure, identify potential issues early, and iterate until the desired outcome is achieved. I will highlight the key areas we have focused on accelerating, our framework for developing this competency, how we use Shiny, and the lessons we've learned along the way. Developing a prototyping competency is crucial for statistical science organizations that wish to stay competitive and innovative in today's rapidly changing landscape."
Liz Roten,Metropolitan Council,regular,How to gracefully expand your R team,Building effective data science teams,2023-09-19,2023-09-19T16:00:00Z,20,"R users don't always come in teams. Often, you may be the only useR on the block. But, one miraculous day, you get to welcome more R folks on your team. Suddenly, the little R system you created to suit your needs, like a custom R package, styling, and file organization, isn't just for you.
Want to suddenly overhaul that one package you wrote two years ago? It probably won't work when your colleagues try to update it. 
Your new teammates are data.table fans, but you prefer the tidyverse. Do you need to refactor?
Are style choices, like indentation important when collaborating, or are you just being persnickety?
In this talk, you will learn how to bring new teammates onboard and blend your respective styles without pulling your hair out."

Bad idea. 1-on-1s are critical for building trust, providing feedback, and ensuring that everyone is on the same page.

Keys to good 1-on-1s start with a small amount of prep and a running shared document of notes and takeaways.  Another key is to rotate types of 1-on-1s. Possibilities include “heads down” on recent work, “heads up” looking further out and career focused sessions.  After some tips on the right sort of questions and uncovering sneaky issues, I will also touch on effective feedback.

I will share resources and hope to include Seussian visuals and a few poetic lines to help the key points stick."

These changes would have been unthinkable 30 years ago, when I started working at Pfizer. In this talk I’ll consider the drivers for these changes, how open-source tools can help achieve this and why collaboration across industry is vital to achieve this goal. I’ll contrast this with my experience of 30 years working in the pharma industry – when the R language had only just been released, when the internet was new and when submissions to agencies were printed out, loaded onto trucks and shipped to their doors."

Our team has 10 APIs in production used in our organization. They are hosted in Posit Connect, but we also have APIs running in Docker containers deployed on Azure. As of today, Posit Connect is limited in its ability to notify when an API encounters an unexpected error. 

We’ve introduced into our Plumber-based APIs {log4r} and append our logs to syslog, which are routinely captured by Azure Monitor and made available in the cloud. By setting up alerts, we now get notified by email -- and text messages for urgent issues – for non-zero exit codes with descriptive error messages. 

With this solution, we have more visibility into the health of our APIs"

At that time, the perception within the USGS was the use of R was exclusive to an elite group of “very serious scientists”. Fast forward, we now find many newer USGS hires having a solid grasp of the language from the start along with the use of R in a wide variety of applications. In this presentation, I’ll discuss my experiences maintaining the dataRetrieval package, how it’s shaped my career, impacted USGS R usage, and why data providers should consider sponsoring their own R packages wrapping their data API services."

Profiling reveals your cool interactive plots are the culprit. What can you do to make things snappy again? We can increase the number of app instances, sure, but suppose that isn't an option for us. Another approach is to shift the plotting work from the server onto the client. In this talk, we'll learn how to leverage two Javascript projects, DuckDB-WASM and Observable's Plot.js, in our Shiny app to create fast, flexible interactive visualizations in the browser without burdening our app's server function. The end result is an app that can scale to more users without needing to increase compute resources."

If you can deploy it successfully, then at the very least it runs, so we’ve got something to work with. 

There’s a bunch of reasons why apps fail to deploy. They can be easy to fix, like Hardcoded secrets, fonts or missing libraries. Or they can be intractable and super frustrating to deal with, like manifest mismatches, resource starvation and missing libraries.  

At the end of this talk I want you to know how to identify, investigate and proactively prevent shiny app deployment failures from happening.

Using a room divider to establish dedicated zones for different activities in a studio apartment is analogous to creating self-contained projects in RStudio. Likewise, swapping mismatched hangers with matching ones to tidy a closet resembles the adoption of a file naming convention to make a directory easier to navigate. In this talk, I will share good practices in file management through the lens of home organization. We all know that clutter, whether it is in our physical space or on our machine, destroys our ability to focus. These practices will help R users of all levels create a serene, relaxing environment where they feel inspired to work with data."

Pandas and the Tidyverse are designed to center building pipelines for the transformation of data frames. However, within these pipelines it is not always clear how each operation is changing the underlying data frame. To explain each step in a pipeline data science instructors resort to hand-drawing diagrams to illustrate the semantics of operations such as filtering, sorting, and grouping. In this talk I will introduce Pandas Tutor and Tidy Data Tutor, step-by-step visual representation engines of data frame transformations. Both tools illustrate the row, column, and cell-wise relationships between an operation’s input and output data frames."

The ability to efficiently operate on names incentivizes good naming patterns and creates efficiency in data wrangling and validation.

However, in a polyglot world, users may find they must leave the pit when comparable syntactic sugar is not accessible in other languages like python and SQL. 

In this talk, I will explain how dplyr’s select helpers inspired my approach to ‘column name contracts’, how good naming systems can help supercharge data management with packages like {dplyr} and {pointblank}, and my experience building the {dbtplyr} to port this functionality to dbt for building complex SQL-based data pipelines."

The former has been designed with large or big data in mind, but currently you need to formulate your queries in SQL.

The new duckplyr package offers the best of both worlds. It transforms a dplyr pipe into a query object that duckdb can execute, using an optimized query plan. It is better than dbplyr because the interface is ""data frames in, data frames out"", and no SQL code is generated.

The result is `nbdev`: a system for creating high quality, documented, tested, understandable Python projects from Jupyter Notebooks. But now something new is changing how we code: the rise of tools based on large language models (LLMs), such as Codex. My view is that these tools can be the basis for a new approach to coding that brings together the best of notebooks, LLMs, and nbdev. A notebook becomes a conversation with an LLM, and the result is a truly ""literate"" program that is self-documenting and simple to maintain."

Writing code to clean data or make visualizations seems categorically different from building robust “software” on which other people rely. In this talk, I’ll show why that distinction is not necessarily true by discussing my personal experience from learning R in graduate school to reporting bugs on GitHub to becoming a co-author of the tidycensus package and a practicing data scientist. The positive and supportive R community on GitHub, Twitter, and elsewhere contribute to why anyone who writes R code can become a package author.

The main issue was that I couldn't find a niche which allowed me to use my existing knowledge while learning the new language. 

 Shiny for Python is a great niche for R users because none of the Python web frameworks can do what Shiny can do. Additionally almost all of your knowledge of the R package is applicable to the Python one. 

This talk will provide an overview of the Python web application landscape and articulate what Shiny adds to this landscape, and then go through the five things that R users need to know before developing their first Shiny for Python application."

Animation and interactivity bring in a key component of analysis that enables you to derive insights that a plot with two dimensions doesn’t otherwise allow. Sometimes it can tell a powerful story and sometimes it can just add some flair to an otherwise low-key story. 

Plotly, Crosstalk and Highcharter are powerful packages that allow interactivity right from within your Quarto markdown report, without the need to create an entire application. Easily have two separate plots interact with each other or add drill down capabilities within a single plot, whichever adds to the story you are trying to tell."
