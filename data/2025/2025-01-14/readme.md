# posit::conf talks

This week we're exploring posit::conf talks! 
On or near the day when this data is posted, the call for speakers for posit::conf(2025) will open. 
Keep an eye on the [posit::conf website](https://posit.co/conference/) if you would like to submit a talk proposal. 
To help inspire you, we've collected data about posit::conf talks from 2023 and 2024. 
Thank you to [Rachael Dempsey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachaeldempsey/) for the Google sheets!

> posit::conf is our annual conference that focuses on the R and Python programming languages and their applications in data science. The conference features a variety of workshops, talks, and networking opportunities for attendees, with a particular emphasis on fostering a sense of community among data science professionals. In addition to providing opportunities for learning and professional development, posit::conf also aims to create a fun and engaging atmosphere that encourages attendees to connect with one another and explore the latest trends and technologies in the field.

- Which speakers gave talks in both 2023 and 2024?
- Are there keywords that appear in track titles in both 2023 and 2024?
- What is the average sentiment of the descriptions in each track?

Be careful to de-duplicate talk data when necessary! 
Talks with multiple speakers might appear more than once.

Thank you to [Jon Harmon](https://github.com/jonthegeek) for curating this week's dataset.

## The Data

```r
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-01-14')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 2)

conf2023 <- tuesdata$conf2023
conf2024 <- tuesdata$conf2024

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

conf2023 <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-01-14/conf2023.csv')
conf2024 <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-01-14/conf2024.csv')
```

## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
- [Submit your own dataset!](../../../.github/pr_instructions.md)

### Cleaning Script

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)

# Mostly clean data provided by Posit.
conf2023_raw <- googlesheets4::read_sheet("<REDACTED>")
conf2023 <- conf2023_raw |> 
  dplyr::mutate(
    session_date = lubridate::ymd(session_date),
    session_start = lubridate::ymd_hm(
      paste(session_date, session_start),
      tz = "America/Chicago"
    ),
    session_length = as.integer(session_length)
  )

conf2024 <- googlesheets4::read_sheet("<REDACTED>") |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
```
