    Stacked bar chart showing the British Libraryâ€™s funding sources from 1998 to
    2023, adjusted to Year 2000 GBP (millions). The chart breaks funding into
    five categories per year: "GIA (blue, dominant throughout), Services (red),"
    Voluntary (yellow), Investment (green), and Other (orange). Funding peaked
    in 2006 and declined gradually thereafter, stabilizing at a lower level from
    2014 onward. GIA remains the largest component, with smaller and more
    variable contributions from other categories. The y-axis ranges from 0 to
    150 million, and the x-axis lists years from 1998 to 2023. Original plot by
    Andy Jackson.
