# WHO TB Burden Data: Incidence, Mortality, and Population

This week, we explore global tuberculosis (TB) burden estimates from the World Health Organization, using data curated via [the getTBinR R package by Sam Abbott](https://samabbott.co.uk/getTBinR/). The dataset includes country-level indicators such as TB incidence, mortality, case detection rates, and population estimates across multiple years. These metrics help researchers, public health professionals, and learners understand the scale and distribution of TB worldwide.



> Tuberculosis remains one of the worldâ€™s deadliest infectious diseases. WHO estimates that 10.6 million people fell ill with TB in 2021, and 1.6 million died from the disease. Monitoring TB burden is essential to guide national responses and global strategies.


- Are there any years where global TB metrics show unusual spikes or drops?
- How does TB mortality differ between HIV-positive and HIV-negative populations?
- Which regions show consistent high TB burden across multiple years?

Thank you to [Darakhshan Nehal](https://github.com/darakhshannehal) for curating this week's dataset.

## The Data

```r
# Using R
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR R package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-11-18')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 46)

who_tb_data <- tuesdata$who_tb_data

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

who_tb_data <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-11-18/who_tb_data.csv')
```

```python
# Using Python
# Option 1: pydytuesday python library
## pip install pydytuesday

import pydytuesday

# Download files from the week, which you can then read in locally
pydytuesday.get_date('2025-11-18')

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub and assign to an object

who_tb_data = pandas.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-11-18/who_tb_data.csv')
```

```julia
# Using Julia
# Option 1: TidierTuesday.jl library
## Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/TidierOrg/TidierTuesday.jl")

using TidierTuesday

# Download files from the week, which you can then read in locally
download_dataset('2025-11-18')

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub and assign to an object with TidierFiles

who_tb_data = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-11-18/who_tb_data.csv")

# Option 3: Read directly from Github and assign without Tidier dependencies
who_tb_data = CSV.read("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-11-18/who_tb_data.csv", DataFrame)
```


## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) report, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R, Python, or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
- [Submit your own dataset!](../../../pr_instructions.md)
