    This histogram shows the distribution of lead concentrations in water samples collected by Flint city officials from January to June 2015, during the Flint water crisis. The x-axis shows lead levels in parts per billion (ppb), with ND indicating non-detectable amounts, and the y-axis shows the number of samples at each concentration level. Most samples cluster at low concentrations, creating a right-skewed distribution with a long tail extending to very high values. Three vertical lines mark important regulatory levels. The blue dashed line is labeled The 90th percentile after excluding two high outliers, the black dashed line is labeled The EPA's lead action level, and the red dashed line is labeled The original 90th percentile before exclusions. Two samples shown in red were excluded from the official calculations, one at 20 ppb and another at 104 ppb.
