    Two plots entitled Daily Mean Fatality Count, 1992-2016, and Daily Mean Fatality Count in April, 1992-2016. The top plot shows fatalities on the y-axis, and day of year on the x-axis. April 20 is marked with a dashed line, and does not appear to be significantly higher than other days of the year. Fatalities are much higher on January 1st, and generally higher in the months following April than at the beginning of the year. The second plot shows fatalities by day of the year within the month of April. The 20th (day 110 in the year) is approximately in the middle of fatality counts for April. Error bars on both plots are noted as representing 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals. Both plots were generated using code provided by @Rmadillo on GitHub.
