# National Science Foundation Grant Terminations under the Trump Administration

This week we're exploring a dataset of grants for scientific research and education projects
from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) that have been terminated by
the Trump administration in 2025. In an unprecedented and possibly illegal action, the NSF has terminated
over 1,000 such grants starting on April 18, 2025, and terminations continue. These
data were collected by [Grant Watch](https://grant-watch.us) by crowdsourcing
from researchers and program administrators, as the administration has not released
information on these terminations.

From a [New York Times article on the terminations](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/science/trump-national-science-foundation-grants.html):

> In general, the agency provides scientists with the opportunity to dispute its
> decisions about funding. But researchers were informed that the decision to
> cancel their grants was final and not subject to appeal.
>
>Scientists expressed fear about the growing disruptions to research and the
> harm it may do to both academia and the public at large.
>
>"Itâ€™s shocking to see the government do this,"" said Jon Freeman, a psychologist
>at Columbia University whose grant on studying facial perception was terminated.
>"It cedes American leadership in science and technology to China and to other
>countries. I think it is going to take at least 10 years for American
>scientific and biomedical research to recover from this."

More information, as well as similar data on grant terminations from the National
Institutes of Health (NIH), can be found at <https://grant-watch.us>.

Some questions you might explore are:

- How many grants, and how much money, were terminated by state or congressional
  district? What institutions? How can you present these on a map?
- Grants from what directorates, divisions, or programs made up most of the 
  projects terminated?
- What topics or terms are most common in project titles or abstracts?

More elaborate analysis could use [data on total awards](https://www.nsf.gov/about/about-nsf-by-the-numbers)
to look at the fraction of awards terminated, or [data on educational institutions](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data)
to look at what kinds of institutions are most affected.

Thank you to [Noam Ross and Scott Delaney, Grant Watch](https://github.com/noamross) for curating this week's dataset.

## The Data

```r
# Using R
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR R package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-05-06')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 18)

nsf_terminations <- tuesdata$nsf_terminations

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

nsf_terminations <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-05-06/nsf_terminations.csv')
```

```python
# Using Python
# Option 1: pydytuesday python library
## pip install pydytuesday

import pydytuesday

# Download files from the week, which you can then read in locally
pydytuesday.get_date('2025-05-06')

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub and assign to an object

nsf_terminations = pandas.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-05-06/nsf_terminations.csv')
```

```julia
# Using Julia
# Option 1: TidierTuesday.jl library
## Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/TidierOrg/TidierTuesday.jl")

using TidierTuesday

# Download files from the week, which you can then read in locally
download_dataset('2025-05-06')

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub and assign to an object with TidierFiles

nsf_terminations = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-05-06/nsf_terminations.csv")

# Option 3: Read directly from Github and assign without Tidier dependencies
nsf_terminations = CSV.read("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-05-06/nsf_terminations.csv", DataFrame)
```


## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) report, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R, Python, or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
- [Submit your own dataset!](../../../pr_instructions.md)
