    A word cloud of the most frequent terms in terminated NSF grant titles and abstracts, with words of different sizes, and different colors, with purple for the largest, red medium, and green small. "Black" stands out prominently in purple. In red, we see "climate", "student", "network", "justice", "identity", "teacher", and "undergraduate".
