NYCT,Clark St,"2,3",Ray Ring,Clark Street Passage,1987,Terrazzo floor tile,"The first model that Brooklyn-born artist Ray Ring submitted for the Clark Street Station renovation in 1983 was a three-dimensional work to be attached to the arched ceiling of the passageway that led from the elevators to the platform, but after discussion this was transformed into a floor piece.  The artist points out, ÒThe  Passage uses three geometric shapes Ð a circle, a square, and a triangle Ð that turn in four different directions.  The floor of the subway corridor is divided into large black squares.  As people walk down the passage they experience all the possible combinations of these elements.  The study of ever-changing geometric patterns comes out of  my earlier work from the 1970s that were shown in an exhibition entitled 2048 Variations on a Drawing by Malevich.  Today, I continue to work in variations of geometric shapes.  My latest pieces utilize computers to help generate large three-dimensional constructions.Ó",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/clark-street-passage
NYCT,125 St,"4,5,6",Houston Conwill,The Open Secret,1986,Bronze - polychromed,"The Open Secret, in the 125th Street and Lexington Avenue station, was the first Arts for Transit commission to be installed in the subway.  The work presents various themes that had long intrigued artist Houston Conwill.  Here, he says, he attempts Òto capture the present for future generations of people through a ritual process; the creation of sacred spaces; and the involvement of a community of people in bearing witness to the process and making it complete,Ó as he put it in his artistÕs statement for the work.  

There is also a mysterious aspect to The Open Secret, to which its title alludes.  For if some future archaeologist breaks it apart, two of its triangular segments, if opened up, will be found to contain time capsules Òholding information and ÔsecretsÕ about a certain place at a certain time Ð Harlem in the 1980s.Ó  Covered with grates so viewers can peer into them, the other two triangular elements reveal a variety of objects.  As Conwill observed in his proposal for the project, ÒThe exploration might be of a place or into our own minds where we might find eternal secrets that are saved and put in the time capsules for our children and their children.Ó 

The leading encyclopedia of African and African American experience, Africana, includes Conwill as one of the Òpioneers of African American visual postmodernism.Ó  
Examples of his public art can be found throughout the nation Ð from New York to San Francisco, Niagara Falls to Miami.  He often works in collaboration with other artists, for instance his sister Estella Conwill M‡jozo, a poet.  The themes of the works often involve the history of African Americans and their quest for freedom and equality.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/open-secret
NYCT,Astor Pl,6,Milton Glaser,Untitled,1986,Porcelain enamel murals,"Milton Glaser, best known for his work in graphics, printmaking, and as a teacher, was approached to augment Rolf OlhausenÕs architectural plans for the restoration/ redesign of Astor Place station.  This was an interesting challenge, since the station boasted some of the most beautiful historic terra cotta and mosaics in the transportation system but at the same time required a large-scale redesign in order to make it function in todayÕs world.  GlaserÕs response was to meld the two  Ð to use the historic Grueby Faience Company plaques (which depicted beavers, a reference to the Astor fortune partly acquired though fur trading) as a springboard for his thoroughly modern design.  

In the artistÕs words,

The design concept É is basically a variation on the existing forms.  By extracting fragments of the motifs on the tile panels, enlarging their scale, and placing these pieces in a random pattern, they take on the appearance of a large puzzle.  Viewers may perceive these fragments and discover their relationship to the original design motifs.  The resulting dialectic between the previously existing and the new panels inspire an appreciation for the original details of the station.

Glaser was born in New York and has often been at the very center of the cityÕs cultural life, for years chairing the board at New York magazine and teaching at the School of Visual Arts.  And he was especially pleased to be asked to design a work for this particular station:  ÒThis was a wonderful commission, not only because of the proximity of Cooper Union, my alma mater, but I lived on the Lower East Side for years, and itÕs good to see the old neighborhood coming back to life.Ó  (Interestingly, GlaserÕs original design for the station included caricatures of the Astor beaver in addition to the abstract forms Ð but his animals reminded community-board reviewers too much of the rats of those earlier, seedier years that they had worked so hard to eliminate!)",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/untitled-glaser-astor
NYCT,Kings Hwy,"B,Q",Rhoda Andors,Kings Highway Hieroglyphs,1987,Porcelain Enamel Murals on Steel,"The artist discusses her work:  ÒIf public art is elegantly and permanently crafted, it will delight audiences of the present and the future, in the way the wall paintings of ancient civilizations delight us today, thousands of years after their creation É  Like the ancient pyramids, the subway is a great monument, with underground caverns, and like them, decorated with art.  It is no accident, then, that the style of these murals is hieroglyphs. I wanted the cool dignity, the symbolism full of messages, the cordial sense of humanity in the figures that are found in the Valley of the Kings É  Perhaps some future archaeologist will dig through the layers of Brooklyn, discovering who knows what relics of our civilization, and find these murals, for after all they are forged in enamel, an art form as permanent and enduring as any.  And perhaps he or she will be able to glimpse in them what daily life was like here, in 1987.  I hope so.Ó",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/Kings-Highway-Hieroglyphs

Because of the need to be resistant to vandalism it was glazed in polycarbonate plastic with zinc extrusions.  I had been interested in the use of plastics and the possibility of ÔleadlinesÕ that are not feasible in glass Ð thus the diagonal ÔcutsÕ going to nowhere in the piece (i.e., stopping in the middle of a color).

Each represents the fossilized remains of biological forms.  From the artistÕs proposal: ""The idea behind Fossils is simple: the subway is underground, fossils are found in the earth . . .

NYCT,23 St,6,Valerie Jaudon,Long Division,1988,Wrought iron railings,"Valerie JaudonÕs Long Division at the Lexington Avenue and 23rd Street subway station seamlessly combines the practical and the aesthetic.  In its purely functional role, it is a sturdy steel fence serving as a security barrier.  But it is a work of art as well, a beckoning welcome into the subway.  The artist said: ÒThe idea was to make a fence that functions as combination of wall, door, window and column that allows you to see the entire stationÉ, a sort of transparent lens through which people can see where they are going and where they have been.Ó The work is divided into panel units, and when placed together their straight and arched lines form decorative patterns.  The abstract stylized motifs, as well as the way she combines them, are directly related to those in JaudonÕs paintings of that time.  The hard imagery that dominated her canvases became three dimensional while maintaining the sense of hard-edged flatness on the same plane.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/long-division

The artist describes the work as being a timeline in etched granite, from records of the site.  ÒIt was once countryside, once had a cabin, and it was also the previous site of Madison Square Garden,Ó said Mullican.  ÒReferencing the iconography of the subway map, the artwork interprets the history of this location through using elements that take you back in time.Ó  The New Yorker, on September 5, 1994, commented, ÒMatt MullicanÕs mural for the 50th Street station on the C and E lines, a sleek, post-Pop design etched into black granite, is smart and sophisticated yet discreet; the artist has recognized that thousands of people will walk by it ten times a week.Ó",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/untitled-50-st
NYCT,86 St,1,Nitza Tufi–o (in collaboration with Grosvenor Neighborhood House Student Muralists),Westside Views,1989,Ceramic Tile,"Westside Views is an unusual project.  It was headed up by artist and teacher Nitza Tufi–o, who worked with 17 young people, most of whom attended or were graduates of the high school equivalency program at Grosvenor Neighborhood House.  The project began when the local community board suggested that amenity funds from a developer, the Bromley Company, be applied to a youth-opportunity community improvement project to improve the 86th Street subway station.  After approval by the cityÕs Planning Commission and Board of Estimate, Arts for Transit was designated as the administrator for the undertaking.  

The overarching concept was to help the students to learn by doing, to acquire problem-solving and strategic thinking abilities through a hands-on collaboration with an experienced mentor, someone they could trust and with whom they could bond.  Nitza Tufi–o was an ideal choice for project leader, since she brought with her an interest in helping young people with social and developmental needs and a proven ability to work successfully with novice artists.  

Tufi–o has said of her approach, in a statement for the New York CityÕs Department of Cultural Affairs website:

As an artist, if I take my brushes and my skills and I invest in the lives of young people, then others can see what is possible.  Maybe it will inspire other artists to share their time.  I want the art work to continue and not to die É this is highly political to have young people lead É we need a chain that grows É I believe human beings can do anything, if we find something that would positively influence them. 

Students first participated in a community survey to determine the theme. Then they took photographs of notable sites in the neighborhood and also held interviews with a variety of community residents.  Ultimately, their work was translated into 40 ceramic tiles that speak volumes about the place and time in which they were created.  The students also worked with Pedro Pietri, whose poetry expresses what it is like to be a Puerto Rican in New York, to create a poem to capture the spirit of the neighborhood, its multi-ethnicity, its parks, the foods Ð the flavor of the community.  The poem is captured in tile and installed in the station.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/westside-views

Metro-North,Harlem-125 St,City Terminal Zone,Alison Saar,Hear the Lone Whistle Moan,1991,Bronze - patinated,"Alison SaarÕs Hear the Lone Whistle Moan consists of two figures standing against a grille gate as they are waiting for the train. There is a man on the north bound platform and a woman on the southbound one.  The woman is arriving in town and the man is leaving New York.  Saar spoke of the work:  

The premise for these pieces was to create a simple narrative of two people.  One, the young woman coming to the city in hopes of advancing her career, the other, a successful businees man leaving the city to return to his home town.  I believe these two scenarios to be examples of how many Americans have used the railroad to and from New York throughout history.  Yet I also was addressing the specific and rich tradition of the role of the railroad in general in the lives of African Americans. Ó  

The title, Hear the Lone Whistle Moan, she continues, comes from a spiritual that uses the train as a metaphor for the passage to heaven.  Trains have often been associated by African Americans with escape and the Underground Railroad in particular, which was sometimes referred to as the Phantom Train. 

SaarÕs own ethnic and cultural background is diverse; she traces her ancestry to Europeans and Native Americans as well as African Americans.

Speaking of her work for the MTA, the artist says, ÒConceptually, Travelin' Time occupies transitional space. It is a space between points, a place of resting, of waiting, of new beginnings and departures.

NYCT,34 St-Herald Sq,"B,D,F,M,Q,N,R,W",Michele Oka Doner,Radiant Site,1991,Ceramic tiles,"Michele Oka DonerÕs Radiant Site, at the Herald Square subway station Ð one of the busiest transit intersections anywhere Ð is a rectilinear floor-to-ceiling passage bathed in an all-pervasive golden light.  The midsection of the corridor is the brightest, glazed in coppery tiles, but these darken and are less reflective toward the top and bottom of the passage, which are glazed in black.  The resulting glow seems to pulse with gentle energy.

DonerÕs oeuvre includes sculpture, furniture, jewelry, functional objects and public art projects.  She fearlessly, and seemingly effortlessly, crosses disciplines and media to create her varied work.  Her creations are almost never totally abstract; they combine her interest in natural history, anthropology, and archeology with inspirations from nature, mythology and the heavens.  A native of Miami Beach, she is perhaps best known for her miles-long bronze-in-terrazzo concourse floors for Miami International Airport, another work whose aim it is to help humanize the transit environment.

In order to assure control over the effects of her work in Radiant Site, the artist made the 11,000 tiles one-by-one and by hand, on a century-old foot-press at the venerable Pewabic Pottery in Detroit.  Their slightly irregular shapes and uneven surfaces were then hand-glazed, varying the formula in tiny increments so as to achieve the desired luminous effect.  Fingerprints and other irregularities are intentionally left, to stress the organic nature of the process.  

Doner says that in thinking about prospective art projects she considers not only the physical and chemical properties of the materials she will use but also Òtheir psychic and cosmic qualities.Ó  In Radiant Site the composition of the tiles and glazes are manipulated in such a way as to make what would be a gloomy place into one that is reflective and inviting.  ÒI donÕt believe in confrontational art;Ó the artist says, Òthe amount of aggression in the city is already overwhelming.  I think of the project as a spiritual sculpture É   Each of the thousands of people who walk along the wall each day becomes enveloped by this mysterious power.Ó",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/radiant-site

With this movement in mind I have made works using several sculptural elements linking areas of a site into a single concept.  I looked at the station Õs existing tile frieze and continued the frieze as a relief tile band.   The relief shows a flight of birds Ð gold when they fly through the gold band and white as they travel over the white tile of the stairwells. I thought of the birds as flying along with the people as both ascend the stairs to the train's elevated platform.Ó",NA

Fischer,Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel Clock,1992,"Stainless Steel and Aluminum, Lighting Elements, Clock","The neo-Deco forms of this giant artwork respond to the architectural integrity of the tunnel ventilation building onto whose side it is visually draped, where it announces the time and provides a glowing welcome.  In the artistÕs words, the clockÕs Òtraditional form and function offer a sense of anticipation, and its sculptural presence instills a sense of wonder by day and at night.Ó  The 86-foot sculpture was commissioned by Arts for Transit and the then Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (now MTA Bridges and Tunnels) to mark the tunnelÕs fortieth Anniversary.  While it serves to tell travelers the time and to provide necessary illumination, the piece, more importantly, is a work of art.
In the 1970s, R. M. Fischer began working on assemblages of industrial objects, transforming them into sculptures with a futuristic look.  Many of these were made from scavenged, salvaged, and reused metal parts.  In the words of a critic writing in Art in America, ÒAt once nostalgic and futuristic, his wacky inventions transform the mundane and prefabricated into the unique and fantastic.Ó  Clocks were often parts of these earlier works; in Brooklyn-Battery Clock Fischer achieves the same result, if in a more serious manner, but here he designs the object from scratch, from new materials. 
 ÒTunnels are also processional gateways and my work celebrates the passage from one New York City borough to another,Ó the artist has said.  The imagery in the work is a response to the architecture of the tunnelÕs nearby ventilation building and its era, automobile imagery, and engineering design.  The sculptures at the top of the work seen in the foreground as drivers enter the tunnel on their way to Brooklyn evoke Coney Island and its famous amusement parks.  The intent of the materials, scale and design aspects of the installation is that the sculpture, along with the lighting treatment, is integrated with the existing architecture to present a single unified composition.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/brooklyn-battery-tunnel-clock

The work began as a collage maquette; this was then faithfully and skillfully enlarged and transformed into a glowing artwork in jewel-like colored glass. 

Bearden graduated from New York University with a degree in mathematics, and also studied art history and philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris, where he met Braque, Matisse, and Mir—.  He also knew the American artist Stuart Davis, who had a marked effect on his work.  Interestingly, early in his career he was employed for a time as a songwriter and also worked as a social worker.  Both experiences would later be reflected in his art.  

Bearden consistently maintained that his concern was with universal human themes, not just those pertaining only to African Americans:  ÒI work out of a response and need to redefine the image of man in the terms of the Negro experience I know best.Ó  Or, as renowned writer Ralph Ellison said in a 1980 Mint Museum catalogue essay, ÒBearden's art is not only an evaluation of his own freedom and responsibility as an individual and artist, it is an affirmation of the irrelevance of the notion of race as a limiting force in the arts.  These are works of a man possessing a rare lucidity of vision.Ó  

City of Light, is classic Bearden as it skillfully weaves together the spirit found in his beloved music, social concerns and his interest in trains.  Rendered in his characteristically bright colors, the work was the result of a long collaboration between Romare Bearden and the fabricators, Benoit Gilsoul and Helmut Schardt.   Following the artistÕs death in 1988, they were able to complete the work from the preparatory studies and instructions he had left behind.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/untitled-city-of-light
LIRR,Penn Station,City Terminal Zone,Andrew Leicester,"Ghost Series: Corinthian Capital, Plinth, Day and Night, Mercury Man, Broken Column, Drawing of Old Pennsylvania Station",1994,Ceramic - Terra cottacarved relief,"Walking from Eighth Avenue down the long, long concourse in the Long Island Rail Road section of Pennsylvania Station, commuters may find themselves transfixed on an enormous black circular form at the far end, surrounded by what appears to be gloomy giant statuary.  Or having descended one of the escalators from 34th  Street they may find it a bit unsettling to be confronted with enormous columns hurtling downward and in the process being shattered.  There is nothing cheerful here Ð and intentionally so.

These are parts of Andrew LeicesterÕs Ghost Series, five towering bas-relief terra cotta murals scattered throughout the station corridors.  These invoke the lost world of the buildingÕs illustrious precursor, the majestic 1910 Beaux-Arts structure by McKim, Mead and White that was demolished in 1963 Ð which the artist calls Òthe sacrificial lamb that initiated the historic preservation movement in the United States.Ó   But Leicester points out that fragments of the old Penn Station are hidden in the lower depths of the building that replaced it; these murals symbolically reveal the old building now ignominiously concealed behind new walls Ð and buried in the landfills of New JerseyÕs Meadowlands.  

In Ghost: Day and Night, a 500 square-foot-mural at the Seventh Avenue end of the main concourse, Leicester has reinterpreted Adolph WinemanÕs sculpture of the same name that presided over the old stationÕs entrances, depicting two voluptuous women flanking a gigantic clock.  The artist has embedded the date on which the original building was destroyed Ð 10/28/63 Ð into the clockÕs otherwise blank face.  Other murals include Mercury Man, a reproduction of another sculptural figure with anonymous fragments from the original building, as well as a large-scale porcelain-on-steel rendering of one of the blueprints for the demolished building.

According to the artist, her intention was Òto create an ensemble of functional and sculptural forms that is unique and specific to the region and together with the architectural structures makes a place that is memorable over time.Ó  Her artist statement continues:

Therefore, the planting of trees in rows in the ÒislandsÓ and the placement of the Òtree ballÓ planters in the paved areas of the central plaza symbolizes and pays homage to a familiar and historic enterprise on Long Island. One of the first tree farms in the United States was started on Long Island and the nursery business has always been a thriving Long Island enterprise.  Old Long Island nursery catalogs offer specific photo 
documentation of the tree moving process with large trees shown as they were being moved on the Long Island Rail Road.

To assure that the planters would suggest tree balls but, at the same time, that the trees could be planted directly into the ground, Adams came up with an ingenious solution: a pre-cast concrete ring surrounds each planting space, and metal support elements in the form of ropes extend upward from them.  

Adams designed Planting through consultation with the planners and architects who were undertaking the enormous challenge of completely replacing a much smaller and outmoded facility for the Long Island Rail RoadÕs important Ronkonkoma station, which serves as a terminus for most commuter trains traveling down the middle of the island.  For instance, the curved ÒeyebrowÓ dormers of the station building are repeated in the curved walls she designed.

The floor-to-ceiling ceramic walls literally escape the four corners of the area to wrap around corners, sneak down steps, and ooze through doorways.  

Blooming takes its title from BloomingdaleÕs, the famous department store just upstairs.  The artist has called the subway a Òdreamy underworld,Ó a place that many riders almost sleepwalk through.  If so, Blooming is a kind of wakeup call.  All of a sudden even the most somnambulant person is confronted with startling and vivid images Ð giant red womensÕ shoes with whiplash laces, enormous pink tree trunks with writhing shoots and branches, and huge yellow mugs filled to the brim with purple coffee.

Murray says that she intended Blooming to serve as a catalyst that Òprovokes the imagination and make the passage brighter, more positive.Ó  Here the artist is following directly in the footsteps of the subwayÕs original decorative designers, Heins and La Farge, proponents of the City Beautiful movement, who, over a century ago, expressly set out to create art to bring out the best in human nature.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/blooming

The inspiration for the work Ð and the source of its title Ð was a piece by Lionel Hampton, the great African American jazz composer and musician.  In Flying HomeÕs ten mosaic panels, selected luminaries of the Harlem pantheon now soar joyfully on the platform walls of the station.  

Since the 1960s, Faith Ringgold has concentrated largely on African American themes.  She is particularly well known for her mixed-media works in the form of quilts or inspired by them.  These works often ingeniously play with stereotypes of blacks, turning images usually associated with prejudice into expressions of racial pride Ð for instance her WhoÕs Afraid of Aunt Jemima of the 1970s.  This was followed by several very successful childrenÕs books in the coming years.  RinggoldÕs work is in the permanent collections of major museums around the nation and the world.  

Harlem heroes on one platform include writers, leaders in the political and civil rights fields, and others of world fame Ð Zora Neale Hurston, Malcolm X, and Jesse Owens among them.  On the opposite side of the tracks, sports figures and musicians are given their due Ð Josephine Baker, Dinah Washington, Sugar Ray Robinson Ð along with artists Jacob Lawrence, Romare Bearden, Aaron Douglas, Norman Lewis, and Augusta Savage, all group ed with the communityÕs revered arts institution, the Studio Museum of Harlem.

For the artist, the ÒlacyÓ curves of the barrier panels Òecho the beauty of the bridgeÕs cross-hatched cables and the feeling of flight as it springs across the East RiverÓ and the tensile strength of Cable Crossing suggests Òthe controlled power of the subway and its network of metal and concrete that undergirds the city.Ó  ÒI wanted to explore movement, using soft curves with hard materials,Ó Gibian says.

Robert TaplinÕs Three Statues (A Short History of the Lower Hudson Valley), indeed, might be taken for ghosts from the areaÕs storied past.  One is a Native American rendered in earth tones; another, in gray, is a prosperous Dutch landowner of the seventeenth or eighteenth century; and the third, in dull reddish hues, is an industrial worker, perhaps from the nineteenth century.  Taplin says, ÒEach figure presents a moment in the history of this place.Ó  And together, they symbolize the sweeping changes the surrounding area has experienced over the past three centuries.

The artist designed his Three Statues, each seven feet tall, to be cast in bronze and then patinated to give the effect of varied surfaces and colors.  They stand proudly on a knoll, raised on a platform as if contemplating the green granite representation of the Hudson River spread in front of them, silently reflecting on the advantages and disadvantages of progress.  The idea is not that they are particular, identifiable historical figures; exactly the converse, in fact.  They are archetypal historic figures Ð even stereotypes Ð that suggest that we might also profitably ponder the past.  

Robert Taplin has taught at several colleges and universities, most recently Yale.  He has received numerous awards and grants for his work as a sculptor, including recognition by the National Endowment for the Arts, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the National Sculpture Society.

NYCT,33 St,6,James Garvey,Lariat Seat Loops,1997,Bronze - hand forged,"James GarveyÕs fourteen sinuous and sculptural Lariat Seat Loops wrap around structural columns at the 33rd Street subway station in a variety of configurations.   In each of the loops, Òthe thick bronze bar encircles the structural column and resembles the lasso demonstration in a Will Rogers film clip,Ó says their creator. As useful as they are decorative, some of the loops serve as handholds and others function as seat rests for weary riders wanting to take a load off their feet.  Each bar swells where it touches the surface and is affixed to the column with custom-forged bolts.
Garvey is trained as both an artist and an artisan.  After receiving a degree in Fine Arts, he worked for ten years as a member of an artisan community in upstate New York.  This was followed by a stint as a union ironworker, where he helped restore the armature of the Statue of Liberty.  He then decided to meld the two disciplines, resulting in several public art commissions where he could utilize both his skill and his creativity to the fullest.
The loops were handmade in GarveyÕs forge in Harlem.  To him, the fact that they were individually crafted is critically important:
I think the labor-intensive blacksmith approach is worthwhile because it has a shared appreciation in our collective unconscious, it demonstrates a traditional work ethic that is recognized by cultures throughout the world. I remain mindful of the most obvious thing about the New York City streetscape, it is a complicated place for people, and I intend to go beyond helping people cope with the conditions. Some people are thinking in conversation, and some are hearing tunes, I am visualizing objects and formations É resolving, refining, and approaching my world with creations. 
ÒWhen a seat rest or handhold design really works, it invites you to touch, to hold on.  You want to use it,Ó says the artist.  ÒMy aim is to put inspiration into routine treks and refresh people caught up in mundane thoughts.Ó",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/lariat-seat-loops

In Signal, artist Mel Chin, collaborating with Seneca tribe member Peter Jemison, draws upon the rich history of this crossroads, which served as a trading route for the tribes of the Six Nations (Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Mohawk, Tuscarora, and Oneida).    

The mezzanine walls contain figures that represent the nations with out-stretched arms reaching to one another.   The main concourse has conical forms at the base of support pillars.  They break up the severe geometry of the space and evoke the form of campfires, used to send signals. 

 In this version, there are lights set within the campfire forms that brighten as trains approach and dim as trains depart.  Patterns within the steel forms are based upon tribal badge patterns, which themselves were based upon a fusion of various cultures with which the tribes communicated.  Another historical overlay is seen in the tile patterns that surround the concourse; they evoke rising smoke while the pattern is inspired by an Iroquois message of peace. The blue and white tile also brings to mind the presence of  the Dutch in the area, known for their blue and white tile work.

Mel Chin is known for making art in unexpected places, including landfills and decaying buildings.  Born in Texas to Chinese parents, he spent his formative years in a primarily Latino and African American neighborhood.  He insists that art should Òprovoke greater social awareness and responsibilityÓ and has been especially active in the movement to introduce art into inner-city communities.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/signal

In the choice of medium, the work is one of the more fragile and complex in the MTA system Ð a collage of multiple components, typical of the artistÕs work.  Juarez explains the process:

My work is composed of a variety of layers which together depict a floating, journeying state, devoid of any fixed perspective.  In addition to consisting of layers of gesso, under-painting, urethane and varnish, I also utilize natural materials Ð rice paper and a dusting of peat moss Ð to give my work added texture, strength and beauty.

Juarez was particularly attracted to the site of the project as it could allow him to continue with his interest in describing Òtranquility, the cyclical nature É and the joy found in the appreciation of common daily routinesÓ:

The Grand Central Waiting Room will be a calming center, a beautiful respite from the surrounding terminalÕs cacophony of visual noise.  Since Grand Central Terminal has been called New York CityÕs cathedral, the waiting roomÕs benches can likewise be conceived of as pews on which passengers can contemplate while looking at this triptych field of flowers, and thereby feel more comfortable and secure white regaining composure and perspective.

A Field of Wild Flowers was created expressly to be compatible with the architecture of Grand Central, repeating some of its historic interior details such as the representations of fruit, acorns, and garlands used in its decoration.  But at the same time it provides enough visual contrast to be read as a new, contemporary work of art that stands on its own.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/field-of-wild-flowers

Metro-North,Grand Central Terminal,City Terminal Zone,Donald Lipski,Sirshasana,1998,"Glass crystals with brass fittings.Fiberglass over aluminum armature, Acrylic paint and Lighting elements","Donald Lipski based his enchanting chandelier Sirshasana on Greek and Hindu myths.  ÒTo the ancient Greeks the olive tree symbolized freedom and purity,Ó he explains.  ÒAnd the name Sirshasana refers to a yoga headstand posture Ð the inverted tree Ð that springs from the Hindu belief that humankindÕs highest energies flow from the infinite forces of the cosmos rather than from earth.Ó   So the chandelier is in the shape of an  olive tree and is suspended upside-down over the entrance to the street-level entrance of the huge and bustling Grand Central Market.  

Since the mid-1980s, Lipski has been fascinated by the iconography of Surrealism, for instance his Waxmusic and Candelabracadaba of 1992, an assemblage of multiple white candles and empty boxes of musical instruments.  Sirshasana partially follows in this tradition, and might properly be called Decorative Surrealism.

SirshasanaÕs form has a writhing, enticing, but also somewhat sinister aspect Ð and its unexpected components add a slightly jangling frisson.  Why is the base of the tree finished in gold?

The historic ceiling in the main concourse at Grand Central Terminal is a particularly beautiful example of this abiding fascination.  
Constellations of luminous stars cover it entirely, backed by an azure blue night sky.  Directing the heavenly show is Mercury, the Roman god of speed and skill who takes the form of a winged messenger.  In this way, Grand CentralÕs critical role in vast world of transportation and communication is stressed.

Ellen DriscollÕs artwork at Grand Central is directly tied into the historical sky ceiling in the terminal.  In As Above, So Below, she conducts a tour of the continents, the heavens, and even the underworld, illustrated by their distinctive myths and legends Ð stories purporting to explain to us the movement of the stars, the creation of the planets, and how mankind is affected, indeed ruled, by these forces.  Thus the title of DriscollÕs work: As Above, So Below.  

To bring home the connection, the faces the artist depicts are those of ordinary, everyday Americans Ð  captured through the technology of photography and then manipulated digitally so that they assume the traditional poses of figures from mythology.

The cartoon-like flatcars are shown carrying all manner of Long-Island-related objects, one prize specimen to a car.  Products of Long IslandÕs fields and waters are represented by a giant lobster, a gargantuan duck (the famed Long Island Flanders one), the king of all potatoes, and a monster bluefish.  Tourist attractions are there too Ð the Montauk lighthouse, a sailboat.  The images are delightfully wacky and bizarrely colored; why, for instance, is the bluefish green and the potato blue?  

Zucker designed his images to be rendered in faceted glass, in such a way that they are be equally powerful day and night and are effective when viewed from either side.  During daylight hours, they respond to the path of the sun as it tracks across the sky.  At night, lights trained on the train give commuters a cheerful glowing welcome back home.  

ÒThe railroad is simultaneously a metaphor for movement and stability,Ó says Zucker; Òit is restless and powerful, gliding across the continent.Ó  But mainly it is meant to be just fun:  ÒI hope that this piece brings travelers enjoyment, that it gives them memories and of Long Island and moments of pleasure.Ó

Jones and GinzelÕs ambitious work, composed of over 300 unique mosaic renderings, responded to the need to make some sort of order out of the subterranean passages.  The artists decided upon the oculus Ð the eye Ð as their central symbol.  In their words, ÒOculus was created to personalize and integrate the stations.  Eyes are both subtle and strong Ð they engage passing individuals, allowing for meditation or inviting dialogue.  People make the choice, but either way theyÔre drawn into a dynamic and connected with the environment.Ó

The eyes are not imaginary ones; they are derived from photographs taken in New York by the artists with a view toward the greatest possible variety of people whose eyes are depicted.  ÒOculus animates the underground world, it harmonizes and challenges, even as it reflects New YorkÕs wonderful diversity and the diversity of the larger world.Ó

An enormous central eye grounds the composition.  Set into the station floor, among circlets of stone and colored glass tiles, a map of the city is ingeniously incorporated into the design.  And the eyes radiating out from it are seemingly omnipresent.  For travelers making their way through the maze are never alone; there is always a reassuring eye to keep them company, note the artists.

The oldest parts of the MTA transportation system have been in existence for only a little over a century, but for Miss they provide an archaeological treasure trove.  Working with architect Lee Harris Pomeroy, she has used the old Union Square stationÕ s transformation into a modern and efficient transit hub, as an opportunity to explore, observe, learn, and teach.  For Miss, new construction at the site uncovered hidden wonders Ð structural elements, cables, and conduits Ð some of them still functional and others superseded by more modern improvements.  Also, old decorative work reappeared Ð mosaics, pilasters, and name plaques Ð  including six eagles in terra cotta dating from the 1904 station that had been presumed destroyed.  

Miss set out to share her findings with users of the station, drawing their attention to the previously hidden wonders though a network of frames, windows, apertures, and mirrors to focus viewers and then to ask them to ponder the changes that this environment has experienced over time.  The bright red frames are immediate attention-grabbers; what is framed by them may be more subtle Ð a bolt, a fragment of ancient-looking mosaic, a piece of rusted steel cable.   Other frames call attention to the stationÕs historic name plaques.   Another framing device is a series of red slots intersected into the enameled black railings that surround above-track walkways, suggesting to travelers that a pause to look though them and downward to the tracks will provide a rewarding lesson in station design and technology.  In her words, ÒIÕm inviting the public to look below the surface, to see a ÔsliceÕ of the station, its structure, its history.  In this most public of places, the apertures offer and intimate engagement.  Looking in, you will see the stationÕs workings Ð sometimes you will see layers of words and reflected images, including your own!Ó

Miss is perhaps best known for her works that blend landscape and constructed forms.  A prime example is her sinuous sculptural forms on the waterfront at South Cove in ManhattanÕs Battery Park City; another is her proposal for the viewing area at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles.  As at Union Square, MissÕs sometimes enigmatic introductions into the environment tempt travelers to pay attention to things they may not have otherwise noticed.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/framing-union-square

SmithÕs vivid murals focus on the story of the subwayÕs creation and trumpet its importance. The artist describes the expansive works:  ÒThe west wall depicts the designers and engineers who achieved this great engineering feat.  The panel on the north wall pays tribute to the workers who dug the tunnels and laid the 722 miles of track.  And the third panel represents the people who use the subway every day and whose lives are improved by it.Ó   In his stylized cityscapes, Smith highlights popular pastimes and haunts for New Yorkers and those who visit here.

Other forms such as wheels and walking feet describe faraway destinations, according to Wynter, and are meant to recall the mass movements of Africans Ð both forced and voluntary Ð throughout history.  The station is located below Frederick Douglass Circle, symbolized by a depiction of the abolitionist crusader Douglass that reinforces the theme of movement and progress.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/migration

ÒThe challenge and opportunity of the Woodside station is in its relationship to the past and to the future,Ó Gerakaris explains.  ÒIn designing art for it, I wanted to create a continuum, to link generations starting centuries ago with wilderness, farms, country lanes, and abundant woods, to today.  People rushing by may become aware of this now vanished town and, upon reflection, realize that they are the link to the future É I wanted Woodside Continuum to present history accurately but in an engaging way.

LIRR,Bayside,City Terminal Zone,Ed McGowin,Bayside Story,1999,Bronze,"Artist Ed McGowin, commenting on his Bayside Story, stated, ÒCommunity history can so easily be lost or forgotten.  I wanted the work to give the public sense of pride about BaysideÕs noble past.  I consulted with the Bayside Historical Society and the community to choose significant local events and people, and I worked in bronze to reinforce a sense of the townÕs permanency.Ó

Bayside was originally the home of the Native American Matinecock people, who were later largely replaced by the English.  In the late 1800s, the wealthy of the Gilded Age built estates there.  Then in the early twentieth century, before the center of the movie industry moved to Hollywood, it was the home of some of filmÕs most illustrious celebrities, the likes of Barrymore and Swanson.  

Ed McGowin has designed and executed numerous outdoor commissions across the United States.  ÒA main concern in my public sculpture is that the public find the sculpture accessible conceptually as well as visually and the work of art invites speculation about the subject matter,Ó he says.  ÒThe Bayside project offered an ideal opportunity for me to create a narrative work of art that used the history of the area as a point of departure for the images.  In this sculpture blending the narrative, visual, historical, and technical elements have produced a permanent work of art that I feel contributes to the community and will be a landmark for many years to come.Ó 

Indians paddling a canoe are given a central position in Bayside Story.  Around them are shown an early settlerÕs homestead, a soldier from the American Revolution, a farm vista, and a representation of Fort Totten, a stronghold built during the Civil War.  A train locomotive prominently appears as well, noting the importance of the Long Island Rail Road to the area.  Finally, boxer ÒGentleman JimÓ Corbett represents local heroes, and other sporting events are included as well, with a yacht for sail races and a checkered flag.  

In addition, Bayside Story features spiral friezes that wrap around the stationÕs supporting columns, bearing animal and floral motifs to call attention to the natural glories of the area.  And a modern train makes the point that the railroad remains an important part of the communityÕs way of life.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/bayside-story

The artist employs antelope horns to signify movement and as a symbol for material prosperity.  Butterflies similarly are used to signify the life cycle, from gestation to birth to the change into adulthood.  The importance of music and rhythm are shown through African drums, a saxophone, and trumpets, all rendered in vivid tones of red, gold and purple contrasted to receding shades of green, blue and turquoise.  ÒThe Franklin Avenue-Fulton Street areaÕs rich African-American heritage is being reborn,Ó says Pryor.

Ik-Joong KangÕs Happy World colorfully expresses and celebrates its liveliness.  ÒHappy World  began when I was riding the subway every day.  I was fascinated by the different people and things I saw, so I took small canvases with me and began to create the images that became the work.  I hope these symbols of contemporary American life Ð familiar, humorous, even strange or obscure Ð will make the tens of thousands of people who ride the 7 train every day talk about what they see and share their impressions.Ó

The mural is composed of over two thousand ceramic tiles, and no two of them are alike.  They show community events and city views, familial gatherings, people at work and children at play Ð everything from the humblest backyard to world-famous buildings such as the Guggenheim Museum.  

For his proposal, the artist carefully worked out the arrangement of the images in the context of the station:  ÒAs subway passengers get on the escalator, they will get a glimpse of a world map on the wall facing them. As the escalator descends, they will get a closer look at the images on each tile. Each ceramic tile will function as part of a puzzle. Ó   The worldÕs continents are shown in shades of green, orange, and red.  

As the workÕs title implies, Ik-Joong KangÕs New York is a thoroughly pleasant place to be.  And even if subway customers know that this is not always the case, it is still pleasant to contemplate, if only for a moment or two, how wonderful it would be if it were.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/happy-world

Here the artist, Isha Shabaka, uses utilitarian railings to point the role of the station as an important neighborhood site.  Their thin and elegant diagonals impart a see-through effect to make the point that the subway is an integral part of the community, there to serve its residents.  The large-scale image of an African mask is boldly designed in open metalwork.  Its nose is a starkly geometric triangle, which symbolizes power and movement in some traditional cultures.  Other shapes in the mask are the changeable curving lines, which allow the form to appear to be variously awake or asleep, vigilant or distracted.

This is achieved by fences and railing designs. The tall and wavy metal constructions echo both the trees and stately apartment buildings lining Eastern Parkway and harmonize with the modern lines of the station house. Most importantly, they lead the way into the station and provide aesthetic uplift for transit users. ""The communities that border Eastern Parkway and the Botanic Garden are blessed with a rich natural bounty,"" Burns says. ""We are surrounded by trees, shrubs, plants, and vines.

At Long Last...,1999,"Glass mosaic, Granite, Terrazzo, Stainless steel, Ceramic tile with text","Sheila Levrant de BrettevilleÕs project for this Inwood station is multi-faceted.  As you enter and leave the station you are reminded that you are at a terminus.  A terrazzo paver marks the spot of the northern most point of the A line, and metallic silver Murano mosaics compose the large letters that also remind you that you of this place of arrival and departure..   Next you encounter white-glazed ceramic tiles which comment on the experience of recent immigrants to New York,  and on the elevator wall are figures depicted from various present-day Latino civilizations Ð including a ÒMoco JumbieÓ stilt dancer and an unorthodox-looking Uncle Sam.  Lastly, there is a motif of flute-playing figures in terrazzo pavers on the mezzanine that comment on the role of music in the community.  ÒMusical history resonates here,Ó she says, Òit is the soul of this community.Ó  She highlights this by etching the words from Billy StrayhornÕs ÒTake the A TrainÓ on the stainless steel railing of the mezzanine stairwell. 

de BrettevilleÕs work celebrates the composition and history of the multinational community in and around Inwood, at the northern tip of Manhattan Ð its multiple generations of immigrants culminating in todayÕs new settlers and their Caribbean heritage.

In her proposal for the Inwood project, de Bretteville says,
 Òin each of my projects I have looked for what elements could make the ÔherenessÕ of the site significant.  I try to seek out aspects of the history of the particular site that could reflect the views and experiences of citizens living and working there in the past, present and hopefully what is there will also be resonant with those who live and work there in the future. Talking with members of the various adjacent communities and reading various histories of the area guides, my choice of images and stories and hopefully insures a vital connection of people to place. I particularly enjoy imagining what could enhance a particular site, the alchemy by which the various images and pieces of texts reveal a hidden history, the plurality of voices reveal agencies and knowledge different from mine at the same time that I too am myself reflected in the experience.Ó

Since the late 1980s, de Bretteville has created public works Ð in concrete, stone, steel, brass and other materials Ð in cities all over the country, including Boston, New Haven, and Los Angeles.  All of these are site-specific, involving local communities and their histories.  She also has worked extensively in graphics, designing publications on art and culture and fine press art editions.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/at-the-start-at-long-last
Metro-North,Harlem-125 St,City Terminal Zone,Terry Adkins,Harlem Encore,1999,"Aluminum, Lighting elements","One of the largest and most imposing structures in Harlem is MTA Metro-NorthÕs Park Avenue Viaduct, which for two miles bisects the community.  The 125th Street railroad station is the first stop in Manhattan for Metro-North trains coming into the city.  With the economic revival of the area, the carefully restored station is experiencing increasing numbers of users and has become a major community focal point.

The bridge that supports the viaduct has been enlivened with a bold new artwork, sculptor Terry AdkinsÕs Harlem Encore.  In a talk he gave titled ÒBlack History Re-imagined,Ó Adkins declared that his art is Òabout humanityÓ:  ÒI try to represent peopleÕs contributions to making the world a better place.  I try to right historical wrongs.  I try to educate, and to give a total view of what individuals such as Sojourner Truth, Jimi Hendrix, Ralph Ellison and Zora Neale Hurston are all about.Ó

Harlem Encore appears in the form of two aluminum relief panels, which are dramatically backlit in blue at night.  On the western side of the bridge, Adkins focuses on HarlemÕs contribution to the arts, humanities, and science.  Also included are representations of ancestors from Africa.  On the opposite, eastern side of the overpass, the New York skyline is shown, with figures of people and their shadows.  

On both sides of the bridge, rather mysterious looking sphinx images appear.  In his narrative statement for the project, Adkins explains, ÒThe front layer of both elevations are framed at either end by stylized sphinxes appropriated from the work of Aaron Douglas, an artist/titan of the Harlem Renaissance.  I was compelled to use this image not only to pay homage to Mr. DouglasÕs seminal Harlem legacy, but also because through him, I personally experienced a direct connection to the Harlem Renaissance era.  The sphinxes are the keystones of the work, speaking of the common Afro-Diaspora of all Harlem residents ÉÓ 

Born in Washington, DC, Adkins received a Masters of Fine Art from the University of Kentucky, has enjoyed several positions as artist-in-residence and exhibits his work extensively.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/harlem-encore

Renowned residents of this famous New York neighborhood are appropriately situated in front of the well-known community locales with which they are associated.  For instance, singer and actor Paul Robeson is shown at the Abyssinian Baptist Church, the poet Langston Hughes at the National Black Theater, and the dancer Alvin Ailey and writer Zora Neale Hurston at the Studio Museum of Harlem.  Thurgood Marshall is pictured as well, as is Marcus Garvey.  Others include Duke Ellington and Bill ÒBojanglesÓ Robinson at the Apollo Theater and Philip Randolph, the influential union organizer, at Harlem Hospital.  

The MintonÕs Playhouse portion of SmithÕs artwork salutes, in the artistÕs words, Òold friends and new contemporaries, with juices flowing as they broke musical ground and discovered new techniques.Ó  Harlem is probably more famous for its contributions to jazz than anything else, and, rather than trying to name and picture all of the greats who contributed to this fame, SmithÕs salute to Harlem jazz is done in a generalized form, where he captures their spirits rather than their exact likenesses.  Here, in the setting of MintonÕs Ð one of the most celebrated Harlem clubs and one that the artist frequented Ð a group of musicians is pictured before a brightly colored glass-tile backdrop, with motifs to suggest jazzÕs debt to the music of Africa and the Caribbean islands.  Represented, along with a tribute to vocal music, are energetic percussion, bass fiddle, piano, saxophone, and trumpet players.

NYCT,Grand Central-42 Street,"S,4,5,6,7",Jackie Ferrara,"Grand Central: Arches, Towers, Pyramids",2000,Ceramic mosaic,"The passageways and waiting areas of Grand CentralÕs subway stations are low and labyrinthine, connecting various areas of the monumental railroad terminal with nearby buildings, the streets above, and the subway system.  They have been likened to the streets of a city, and they indeed could be considered a miniature version of New York Ð but with the skyline left out.  Grand Central: Arches, Towers, Pyramids corrects this omission.  

Jackie Ferrara, a minimalist architectural and landscape artist, has been interested throughout her long and fruitful career in the simple and repetitive forms of building.  Grand Central: Arches, Towers, Pyramids  harks back to one of her most celebrated, Stacked Pyramid, which she exhibited to acclaim at Storm King Art Center in 1973.
FerraraÕs building forms are structures of a curious sort Ð simple, schematic, almost primitive looking.  Taken together, they lend a unity and meditative character to the space; as people move through the platforms and passageways, the images seeming to shift and mutate Ð no two vistas are the same.  The artist says she thinks of these as pieces of a puzzle, but not a sterile one susceptible to only one solution; rather, each viewer is invited to come up with his or her own solution by mentally putting together the various shapes in different ways. 

Nothing is casual or unintentional in the artistÕs design.  Each mosaic is placed in a predetermined position in a rigid, precisely measured grid; a narrow vertical stripe separates the images.  Ferrara explains, ÒThis sequence of stripe/image is calculated.  It can be seen as images on a strip of film, or a line of faces framed in the windows of a passing train.Ó",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/grand-central-arches-towers-pyramids

The work is a swirling assemblage of images, from outer space to the earthÕs core, from the first organisms to emerge from the primeval ooze to mammals of today.  The artwork was a collaboration between MTA Arts for Transit and the American Museum of Natural History; the museum provided support and Arts for TransitÕs interviews of their scientists, educators and docents inspired the design of the artwork.  
Glass mosaic, glass tile, ceramic tile, granite, and bronze relief are combined in a variety of ways to highlight the ten key fields represented at the museum: anthropology, astronomy, earth and planetary sciences, entomology, herpetology, ichthyology, invertebrates, mamma logy, ornithology and vertebrate paleontology.  The result is a compelling visual treatise on the earth, its inhabitants Ð both past and present Ð and the heavens that surround it. 

The mosaics depict animals both extant and extinct, the former in full color and the latter in gray tones.  They are arranged so that forebears are paired with those they preceded.  For instance, a dodo is shown with a crane and a mastodon with an elephant.  Why are dinosaurs pictured with the number 5 in red?  This is to symbolize the Òfifth extinction,Ó the planet-wide calamity that marked their demise.  But some of their descendants survived, as indicated by the crocodile skulking nearby.

For Want of a Nail, the title of which is taken from an old proverb, asks the viewer to ponder the way in which everything in the universe is connected and how it, the earth, and organisms have changed and continue to change over time.

Al Loving, who created the work, talks about the medium: 

Faceted glass is an opportunity to work with real light É In ancient Chinese culture the spiral was the tip of the flame.  In contemporary time it is a symbol of continuity.  I have tried to bring a spirit of inclusiveness to this project. 

Loving has said of the work that it expresses a Òspirit of interdependence and interconnection as an important aspect of the American experience,Ó reflecting the fact that this large station is literally a cultural crossroad.  Working with natural light, the artist aims to Òfuse human animism with intellectual visual consciousness.Ó  The overall effect of the work is to bring a new liveliness into the station; its vividly colorful and energetic forms introduce a sense of optimism and well-being.  

Al Loving, a well-known African American collage artist, painter, and educator, enjoyed a long and productive career.  In 1969, his hard-edged geometric paintings in a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of Art brought him to the attention of the museum-going public.  He was fascinated with the shape of a spiral and spent much of his life exploring this form as well as inquisitively studying the properties of bright and bold colors.  LovingÕs work has been described as fluid.  In 1974, in a New York Times review, he described his multi-layered, acrylic painted constructions as Òdynamically composed reliefs, wall pieces that energize the space around them, seemingly almost to be caught in the act of moving across the wall.Ó  This dynamic quality infuses Brooklyn, New Morning as well, but this time in glass and glass mosaic.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/brooklyn-new-morning

Feet follow you everywhere throughout the Court Square (23rd Street and Ely Avenue) subway station, whether you are walking or riding the people mover.  Elizabeth Murray has called her artwork Stream, to evoke feet as they stream out along the passageway.  Initially the artist had planned to create a totally abstract work, but eventually decided to continue with imagery in the manner she used to great acclaim with her previous project, Blooming, in the Lexington Avenue and 59th  Street  station.  
This is not the first time Elizabeth Murray has moved from total abstraction to the introduction of imagery.  To be sure, her early work included simple colorful abstract forms and lines, but early on she introduced familiar shapes and forms as well.  Murray kept her audience in mind as she created these magical forms; they connect spaces as people travel through them.  They also connect viewers with the spirit of the artist as mosaic tesserae in vibrant colors fill the walls.  Murray has said that she embraces the changes that occur during her process of creation, that in fact change is integral to her working method. The changes that occur are part of the art.  What could be more fitting in a space that is constantly changing throughout the day with the sea of people passing by?
The public art of Elizabeth Murray is in many ways definitive of the MTA collection.  It sends the message to the public that the art is for them.  This is the philosophy of Arts for Transit brought to life.   Here is work that is the very best of what art in the public realm can be.

NYCT,34 St-Penn Station,"A,C,E",Eric Fischl,The Garden of Circus Delights,2001,Glass Mosaic,"In The Garden of Circus Delights recalls as well as anticipates an annual event eagerly awaited by tens of thousands of New Yorkers and out-of-towners alike.  And what more appropriate place to do this than the 34th Street and Eighth Avenue subway complex at Penn Station, located directly beneath Madison Square Garden, which for many years has acted as the host for the appearance of Òthe Greatest Show on Earth.Ó  

Eric Fischl, the artist, earned a reputation as a New Image painter for his provocative and harshly realistic figure and genre scenes.  Much of his work is narrative, loaded with everyday drama, a conscious and deliberated departure from the canon of abstraction.  The Garden of Circus Delights follows in this tradition.  

Fischl created these four small and three large murals to snap commuters out of their everyday routines and into Òa journey of the spirit that goes from serenity and harmony though strangeness and chaos and back.Ó  ÒI thought it would be amusing,Ó he says, Òto do a contemporary DanteÕs Inferno, to turn commuting into a spiritual quest.Ó  The murals surround riders with a circus world of fire-breathers, acrobats, and animals; only gradually does one realize that something else may be going on: a commuter leaves home on an otherwise normal day and is pulled into the circus action.  

ÒWhen you encounter him on the far wall,Ó says Fischl, ÒheÕs surrounded by circus figures and he begins a journey with them.  On the way he meets incredible and bizarre characters as the circus gets stranger and stranger.  On the other side of the tent he emerges in the white light and harmony, a commuter once again, but transported and transformed.Ó",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/garden-of-circus-delights
NYCT,Times Sq-42 St,"N,Q,R,S,1,2,3,7,A,C,E",Jacob Lawrence,New York in Transit,2001,glass mosaic,"The enormous mural New York in Transit is the focal point of the new elliptical mezzanine in the Times Square subway complex.  Taken together, its thousands of color-washed facets constitute a hymn of praise to the city of New York, its streets, neighborhoods, sports Ð and its subway.  

Although born in Atlantic City, Jacob Lawrence lived in New York for much of his life, and he often incorporated his observations and memories of the city into his art.   The artist spent his childhood in Harlem and then studied at the Harlem Art Workshop under Charles Alston. He also attended the American ArtistsÕ School in 1937 and worked as a painter for the WPA Federal Art Project. He is best known for historical works that depict the lives of famous African American figures, particularly those involved in the civil rights movement and their precursors.  Later his work became more abstract and more colorful.  

In these later works, Lawrence took as his subjects the city and its people.  He insisted that his characteristic bold and colorful forms were also directly linked to the living conditions he experienced in his youth. The artist recalls in a book celebrating his art and life, Over the Line: The Art and Life of Jacob Lawrence, Peter Nesbett & Michelle Dubois, eds. (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2001):

Our homes were very decorative, full of pattern, like inexpensive throw rugs. It must have had some influence, all this color and everything.  Because we were so poor the people used this as a means of brightening their life.  I used to do bright patterns after these throw rugs; I got ideas from them, the arabesques, the movement and so on. 

New York in Transit was Jacob LawrenceÕs last public work.  Here he evokes city life as it might be seen from an elevated train, subtle and diffuse at first but upon closer inspection detailed and striking.  Undertaken when the artist was suffering from an illness from which he would not recover, this work is reflective and contemplative in attitude.  As in Roy Lichtenstein Õs Times Square Mural in the same station, LawrenceÕs New York in Transit is in many ways a meditation on a great artistÕs life Ð a parting gift to New York City and the millions of people who live Ð and have lived Ð here.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/new-york-in-transit
NYCT,Church Av,"2,5",Louis Delsarte,Transitions,2001,Glass mosaic,"BrooklynÕs Flatbush is an area of great ethnic diversity, including many recent immigrants who have contributed their own idiosyncratic flavor to the cultural life of the city.  Among these relative newcomers are people from the Caribbean, who brought with them the idea for an event that has become one of the cityÕs largest and most lively events Ð the West Indian-American Day Parade.  In his artwork at BrooklynÕs Church Avenue, Louis Delsarte evokes its color and energy.  Ò This neighborhood has had many different groups moving in and out over the years.  Now itÕs predominately Caribbean, and I wanted to freeze a moment in its history,Ó says the artist.  In the part of the work called ÒJump-Up,Ó abstract shapes compete with more realistic figures to evoke a wild Carnival dance.  ÒAvenue of ChurchesÓ is about Sunday morning reverence.

Living up to its name, it depicts a serenely peaceful setting of trees, a lake and sky, shown in restful shades of green, blue and yellow.  Artist Marjorie Blackwell wanted Òthe colors and how they are shaped and dance across the windscreenÓ to give commuters Òsomething to play with, mediate with, and connect with at the station.Ó  All of this is a pleasant contrast to the frenzied atmosphere of the city that commuters on the platform are either headed into or emerging from.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/tranquility
NYCT,66 St-Lincoln Center,1,Nancy Spero,"Artemis, Acrobats, Divas, and Dancers",2001,Glass and Ceramic Mosaic,"Nancy SperoÕs Artemis, Acrobats, Divas, and Dancers at 66th Street at Lincoln Center, a series of twenty-two brilliantly colored glass mosaic panels, line the walls of the station.  SperoÕs work evokes both the Lincoln CenterÕs performing arts institutions Ð opera, ballet, classical music Ð and the vibrant, artistic character of the Upper West Side neighborhood.  She conveys this through the use of iconic images of women both real and mythical, from such varied sources as archaeology, architecture, mythology and the contemporary world.

In her long career, Nancy Spero, in her website, says she has consistently focused her art on Òchallenging questions about women as artists and women as women.Ó  In the 1960s she began working as a figurative abstract painter with a political agenda.  Medium has always been important to her; she has generally avoided working on canvas, the usual way to success in the art world, preferring paper and collage.  To her, these symbolize  ÒwomenÕs liberation from traditional language into communication that seemed more pertinent.Ó  Further, from the 1970s onward she rejected all but female images in her work and sometimes included text with depictions of partial female forms, addressing issues of womenÕs control over their own bodies.  Her present work often reveals an element of sadness, even despair: ÒIn many of the works now IÕm trying to depict a sense of the vitality of life, but also to pose the question: what does happen after the revolution?  There have to be solutions and there arenÕt a lot of themÉÓ 

In Artemis, Acrobats, Divas, and Dancers, the central icon of opera, the Diva, is repeated in various forms that lead and follow riders through the station, giving the illusion of movement and change.  In another area, Spero represents scenes from the subway and the city outside, the architectural backgrounds enlivened by musicians performing and athletes running.  Viewing the work, you intuit that you are in a sophisticated, theatrical place Ð which is exactly, of course, what Lincoln Center, the area aboveground, is.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/artemis-acrobats-divas-and-dancers
NYCT,14 St-8 Av,"A,C,E,L",Tom Otterness,Life Underground,2001,Bronze,"Tom OtternessÕs figures in Life Underground are humorous, captivating, and, to be sure, also a bit disconcerting.  The subject he has chosen is the subway, its history and construction and its place in the life of the city.  Among the rather surreal apparitions are an alligator poking its head through a sewer opening and consuming a man with a Òmoney bagÓ head; colossal feet; and a totem-like sculpture whose human features are formed into the shape of a telephone.  An antiseptic environment is invigorated and transformed into a place of joy and whimsy.  ÒI wanted to celebrate the monumental effort it took to create the system Ð an effort of both design and drudgery, of muscle and mind Ð and to represent the system as an underground world of its own, a subterranean cross-section of New York.Ó

Otterness is one of the most sought-after sculptors working today.  A member of the artistsÕ activist group Collaborative Projects in 1977, he first pictured his tubby toy-like characteristic figures as parts of classical friezes suggesting temple reliefs and pediments. Ironically, his cherub-like figures were often portrayed engaged in love and war while referencing classical art and architecture.  His primitive figures seem both remote and familiar Ð a mixture of classical art and comic strips.  

OtternessÕs sometimes bizarre figures are placed in the most unlikely places in the 14 th Street station.  They lurk in the stairwells; they dangle from the ceiling; they peer at riders from under barriers; they rest at the foot of pillars.  Hints as to their meaning are given by their poses and expressions as well as what they carry or have with them; some are shown with tools to indicate they are subway workers and others are sidewalk superintendents, just observing.  Others are intently sweeping up piles of coins, an allusion to the subject that seems to obsess New York more than any other.  Indeed, the critique of money and pervasive consumer culture has often preoccupied Otterness.   In all of his projects, however, as in Life Underground, the artistÕs touch is light and whimsical, making the art all the more effective for its deftness.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/life-underground
NYCT,Canal St,"A,C,E",Walter Martin & Paloma Mu–oz,A Gathering,2001,"Bronze sculptures on token booth, railings, and beams throughout mezzanine","Walter Martin and Paloma Mu–oz have turned the Canal Street Station into something at first glance reminiscent of Alfred HitchcockÕs The Birds.  But the birds in The Gathering are not menacing but somehow comforting.  There are dozens of them in total Ð 174 grackles and blackbirds, in a number of different poses, and seven crows, all cast in bronze and given a glossy black patinated coating.  They stand in groups, like people waiting in the subway, thinking, conversing, or studiedly ignoring one another.  Most of them can be found roosting on railings, watching and serving as companions to the flocks of people using the transportation system.  Birds, the artists note, are very social creatures Ð just like New Yorkers; riders may find echoes of themselves and other subway travelers in their lively, cocky, quizzical interactions.

Canal Street has been a commercial area for many decades.  Once primarily a warehouse district, today it is a main artery of several busy neighborhoods, long-established Little Italy and Chinatown and the newer and more hip SoHo and TriBeCa.  The streetÕs offerings range from Chinese delicacies, produce and herbal medicines to electronics to restaurants serving every kind of dish in every price range.  

But one thing that Canal Street largely lacks is the leavening influence of nature.  The birds of A Gathering make up for this, enlivening the space and bringing relief from the sometimes oppressive commercialism of the area.  Walter Martin and Paloma Mu–oz, whose studio is in Brooklyn, have collaborated on art for many years. As part of Arts for TransitÕs Lightbox Project, they installed their series of ÒTravelers,Ó in the lower level of Grand Central Terminal.  They created of 20 sculptural vignettes and photographed them to appear to be snow globes, creating magical winter wonderlands.  Part of this series traveled to the Wilshire/Normandie Metro Rail station in Los Angeles as part of Metro Arts Lightbox Series.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/a-gathering

At times, the murals recall blossoming flowers, twisting branches, or meandering patterns that mimic genetic elements.  If one stops for a fleeting moment as the train flies by, a kaleidoscopic effect is created.  When the artistÕs signature style is translated into the faceted glass murals, the organic silhouettes are as elegant and captivating as the work-on-paper from which it was adapted.

Sixteen panels of faceted glass murals narrate the daily moments of citizens interacting with the motions of trains in the urban setting.  As Robinson observes, ÒA simple subway ride is a cultural exploration, a cross-section of a city as it moves from past to present and onto tomorrow.  All races, creeds, and colors interconnect on a common path to an endless variety of destinations. Each rider enriches by daily discoveries of new faces, places, and things,  Each individual work presented in this series is part of a larger whole, strung together, as it were, like the links in a chain or, more appropriately, the cars of a train.

Trees and sky seem eerily real; the space appears to expand and depth is convincingly suggested.  In the artistÕs words, ÒI envisioned an imaginary room revealed behind the sliding tile walls Ð a quiet, restful space with a radiant view to the outside, a room of tranquility.  I wanted the room to have illusionary windows that would seem to let the outside world penetrate into the station.Ó

Brandt rose to the challenge of responding to the site with a work that relates to AcconciÕs in counterpoint.

They are arranged in clusters throughout the interior and exterior of the station overpass and waiting area.  And, for good measure, two of them are child-size.  the chairs were cast by using a special molding was, with great care taken not to damage or mar the originals.  Then the castings were finished by hand to assure that each was a perfect replica.  Finally, each was given a custom finish and patination to assure that each echoes its real prototype in color as well as form.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/almost-home

Conceived and originally installed by artist Max Neuhaus, it provides a rich harmonic sound texture that emerges from a large underground vault covered by a grating.

Commenting on artwork, Neuhaus has said, ""For those who find and accept the work's anomaly, the island becomes a different place, separate, but including its surroundings. People, having no way of knowing that it has been deliberately made, usually claim the work as a place of their own discovering."" 

Installed by the artist in 1977, the artwork remained active until 1992, when Neuhaus moved abroad.

The effect is mesmerizing: in HickmanÕs words, Òthe fine glass filigree acts to atmospherically filter daylight into the station; surrounding buildings become distorted like impressionist paintings.Ó Another of HickmanÕs interests is film, and he sees important connections between his work in glass and the cinema, since both involve the creative arrangement and rearrangement of disparate, fragmented elements Ð and they also both depend for their effects on light streaming through semitransparent elements.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/laced-canopy

NYCT,Times Sq-42 St,"S,N,Q,R,7,1,2,3,A,C,E",Roy Lichtenstein,Times Square Mural,2002,Porcelain enamel on steel,"Roy LichtensteinÕs Times Square Mural captures the spirit of the subway, its linearity and its dynamism.  It tips its hat to both the past and the future, with its retro-futuristic forms Ð the central image is a levitating winged tubular car making its way through the tunnels of a subterranean station.  And not just any station, for the specific architectural details and particularly the giant 42 sign indicate that this is Times Square, the throbbing heart of Manhattan.

Lichtenstein was a true Son of the City.  He was born in New York, in 1923; studied here, at the Parsons School of Design and the Art Students League; made it the center of his and his familyÕs life for most of his career; and died here, in 1997.  His work is often viewed as emblematic of mid-twentieth century New York, particularly Manhattan, with its emphasis on surface, large scale, mass marketing, and modernistic design.  

Times Square Mural is in many ways a synthesis of LichtensteinÕs career.  It is replete with references to and variations on the artistÕs earlier works.  For instance, the futuristic transporter can be directly linked to his painting Emeralds and also his abstract ships in his New York State Mural images.  The architectural ornament is adapted from his Entablatures of the 1970s.  And he has taken the building and billboard forms from a combination of his Imperfect paintings and his Modern series that began with his poster for the Lincoln Center Film Festival of 1966.  

For Times Square Mural Lichtenstein also freely appropriated and incorporated images from the works of other artists and designers.  Indeed, he once commented, as noted on the Artelino.com website (looking for original source),  ÒAll my art is in some way about other art, even if the other art is cartoons.Ó  For instance, the hooded figure at the right of the mural is from the Buck Rogers comic strips tha t ran from the 1920s through the 1960s, a favorite of the artist.  And a more literal borrowing is the iconic 42 image from Philip CoppolaÕs Silver Connections series of drawings of the architectural detail of the subway.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/times-square-mural

The area around Hicksville was once a notable rarity, an example of an original prairie landscape Ð the type of environment we think of in connection with the Midwest, but located on Long Island.  Here Nicholson recaptures that setting, in both look and spirit, as if it were being seen from a train speeding through it.  The colors vary according to the time of day depicted Ð soft green and blue hues for sunrise in Morning Transit, and red and blue hues for sunset in Evening Transit.   ÒEach commuter imagines his or her own personal scenery,Ó said Nicholson in a 2000 interview.  ÒOne can look at it over and over again and discover new images.Ó  

A native of Great Britain, Roy Nicholson has had a long and fruitful career as an artist and arts administrator.  For many years he headed a regional arts council in England, where he organized exhibitions on leading European artists including CŽzanne and Claude Lorrain.  More recently he has taught at the Southampton Graduate Campus of Long Island University and has exhibited his paintings in a number of museums and galleries on Long Island and in New York City.  

NicholsonÕs Hempstead murals are sensitively integrated in the station waiting room.  In addition, special lighting emanating from the tops of nearby columns is used to show them to best advantage.

On both sides of the tunnel, slightly strange things start to appear on the walls.  First come monochromatic rock outcroppings, followed by tree roots and more rock strata, and then animal burrows.  Finally these are joined by quotations Ð from sources as diverse as Ovid, James Joyce, and Mother Goose.  

Environmental artist Samm Kunce says that her Under Bryant Park project is Òbased on the idea of systems Ð the cityÕs water system, the system of tree routes and animal tunnels underground, and the system of language, history, and knowledgeÓ (a nod to the New York Public Library nearby).  In her words, ÒWe travel in the subway system. Our water is delivered via a system of pipes. The plants and trees that provide grace and softness against the cityÕs sharper edges find a way to the water that resides naturally underground by systems of roots.  Literature is shared by systems of learning and lending in schools and libraries. Moles and rabbits live in systems of burrows, as most of us inhabit divided portions of larger buildings.Ó  

Samm KunceÕs environmental concerns come to the fore in the summation of the work on the large wall at the end of the tunnel, a frieze of rock and plant forms where vivid color inserts itself into the picture for the first time: a Delphic observation from pioneering psychologist Carl Jung:  ÒNature must not win the game, but she cannot lose.Ó",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/under-bryant-park

For the top windowed sections on all four sides of the two elevator towers, she created a series of images depicting commuters and trains, with one tower showing contemporary scenes and the other depicting corresponding scenes in a historical context.  During her research into the history of Harrison, the artist discovered how integral the train was to the development of the community; railroads often determined whether a town grew or declined.

The architects, diDomenico + Partners, had been given the task of redesigning the station, including the challenge of opening up the lower levels to allow light to flow through to them.  Early on, it was realized that this was the perfect opportunity for an artist to work closely with the architects.

Internationally known Vito Acconci Ð who had grown up in the Bronx Ð was a logical choice.  Acconci has had a very active and diverse career.  He began his career as a poet and in the late 1960s and early 1970s was a well known performance artist.   In recent projects he has joined with architects and landscape designers to visualize and build ambitious constructions that meditate on and meld the meeting of private and public spaces.  At the Yankee Stadium station, his illusion of walls being opened to the outside led to the opportunity to include yet another work of art, one that would be revealed as the walls in the elevated station slid up on the ceiling and down through the floors.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/wall-slide
NYCT,42 St-Port Authority Bus Terminal,"A,C,E",Lisa Dinhofer,Losing my Marbles,2003,Glass mosaics,"Lisa DinhoferÕs Losing My Marbles is part of her ongoing fascination with marbles and other childrenÕs toys.  ÒToys are caricatures in miniature of society at large. É  they carry a collective, popular memory,Ó she declared in her artist statement for the work.   The artwork is gigantic, taking up a large wall encountered by the subway rider head-on and two flanking walls, a total of 44 linear feet of wall space.  The main wall is designed as to simulate three-dimensional space, to draw the viewer into the work; the side walls help the artist to achieve a wrap-around effect.  

Dinhofer commented on her working method and the effects she achieves, ÒThe goal of my work is to fascinate visually.  Through color, light, orchestrated movement and playful objects the audience is drawn into an enchanted environment where people become smaller and playing marbles loom large.  I am an ÔillusionistÕ painter rather than a Ôrealist.Õ  All the objects I depict are real, they exist, but I chose to create my own special plane . . . The marbles themselves inhabit our imagination and memory.  They are joyful and they are beautiful.  There are smiles in this piece, there is an exuberance to this piece, and ultimately there is a true delight.  And that is magic.Ó 

To stress the illusionist character of the piece, a golden trompe lÕoeil frame surrounds the main wall, depicting a floor of black and white squares with marbles seemingly floating in space.  Concave murals are strategically introduced to add further dimension and to literally draw viewers deeper into the work, via their distorted reflections.  The marbles on the side walls seem to have burst forth from the main wall or else to be rushing to join them.  In her artist statement, Dinhofer commented, ÒHere I can be an abstract expressionist and a realist at the same time.  My space is imaginary but my objects are observed.Ó",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/losing-my-marbles

He wanted something people would notice and that it would be uplifting. He didnÕt want to do a straight realistic impression of the neighborhood.  He thought a lot about religious murals and their symbolism. É The feel for the work is based in early Renaissance murals, especially those of Piero della Francesca, who inspired him.

It is enormous, wildly colorful, and transfixing.  here Held set out to depict nothing less than the universe, conceived a a geometric abstraction, with precise multihued shapes afloat in space, dizzily defying gravity.  In the 1960s, Held turned from abstract expressionism to tightly controlled, geometric pieces, with two-dimensional figures that seem weightlessly suspended on the canvass or even appearing to burst forth from it.  The earliest works of this type were in black and white, but later Held became a master of saturated, mannerist color.  At the same time, his works became larger and larger.  Passing Though is an excellent example of his mature style.Held was a polymath, curious about everything and how it works, especially at the level of theoretical physics.  he was particularly fascinated by chaos theory, cosmic strings, black holes, and all other arcane descriptions of the cosmos and explanations of how it works.  In his art, he attempted to represent these concepts in a way that suggests both their complexity and beauty --""images that we believe in but that are beyond our senses and that we can never experience directly.""  In Passing Through he asks us to leave our everyday concerns and think about these imponderables.But there is also a more down-to-earth subject here-building and buildings --architectural forms and how they are conceived and constructed, how they evolve.  Held's imagery powerfully evokes sometimes mimics, the forms and styles of the Midtown skyscrapers overhead.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/passing-through

In a subtle way, the brilliantly colored forms evoke the feeling of the swirling cosmos.  For this commission, the artist produced a series of drawings in the exact size of the window openings, carefully considering the component shapes and colors and the fact that the drawings would later be translated into a new and different medium, faceted glass.

According to the artist, he is particularly attracted by Òthe idea of traveling in infinite space, which is as a passenger on the Earth Express line, experienced through the cycle of the seasons.Ó  In his proposal to Arts for Transit, he brought this fascination with him.  He was particularly happy that the project involved windows, he says Ð Òa new and exciting medium for me to work with, faceted glass. É  These windows have allowed me to expand my understanding of the possibilities that this concept has as public art, also what and how different mediums expand the impact that a work of art has on the public.Ó

ÒMy art has always been informed by my interest in African art and music, the African American experience, the Cubist school, and contemporary American painters,Ó Ausby says.

The bewildering junction of subway lines of the Atlantic Avenue Terminal Complex presented a perfect opportunity to further explore this idea.  Trakas has created critically acclaimed public art works around the world, including a bridge at a knife factory in Thiers, France, called the Sword Bridge, which, although minimal, unmistakably evokes the idea of a blade; it is consummate Trakas: simple, thoughtful and even profound in attention to form and materials. 

At Atlantic Avenue, the architectsÕ intent was to bring together a myriad of passages and stairways to create a functional space with a unified feeling. TrakasÕs ideas are melded with the equally clear vision of architects di Domenico + Partners to  create forms and spaces that underscore both the efficiency and beauty of the cavernous space, once again evoking the philosophy under which the original subway was built.

Trakas carefully selected the stone pavers and bollards incorporated into the plaza at the station.  The architects designed a skylight for the roof of the historic station kiosk to help illuminate the platform below.  The former entry building now includes a brick-sized opening equipped with a lens which adds interest, allowing riders a downward view into the subway.  A boat-shaped gantry, made of stainless steel and mesh, is situated beneath the skylight; this is both aesthetically pleasing and a functional amenity (it allows workers to access the area for cleaning and changing light bulbs).  

One particularly clever element is a granite ÒwaveÓ sited at the point where the two stations, Atlantic and Pacific, cross Ð and it succeeds in making these passageways flow.   Playing on the names Atlantic and Pacific, the overall idea is to suggest a place of landing and departure Ð functions that both subway stations and seaports share.

Each mosaic has a pictorial theme; one features cherry trees and the other depicts giant shad, fish of the herring family, swimming on a blue background. As with most of his public works, the artist undertook extensive research into the neighborhoodÕs history Ð both its environmental and its manmade components.  This was followed by watercolor sketches that were subsequently transformed into glass mosaic murals by craftsmen working with the artist.

Shad Crossing depicts a delicacy that brings to mind both livelihood and familial gatherings.  The artist notes that in the late nineteenth century Òthese shad were found along the Hudson River when new immigrants came to New York, most of them settled on the Lower East Side.Ó  There is something spiritual about the fish, in that they evoke the magic of the water that surrounds Lower Manhattan.  These images celebrate the return of the shad, once abundant in this area, to New York and water as a metaphor for Òcrossing,Ó in this case the action of traveling or commuting to Brooklyn.  (Happily, the shad population of the waters surrounding Manhattan is now on the rise, thanks to environmental efforts.)
  
Delancey Orchard is the title of the mural on the Manhattan-bound platform.  Inspiration for the orchard image grew out of historical research revealing that the once-prominent  DeLancey family owned substantial property in Manhattan in the eighteenth century.  A farm, owned by Lieutenant DeLancey, stretched from the East River to the Hudson River. Ming Fay's orchard mural references the cherry orchard that was part of the farm and was located where nearby Orchard Street is now located. As with the shad murals, images of the larger figures are placed along stairwells and in other areas of the station.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/shad-crossing-delancey-orchard

Seventy-eight of these artifacts are installed in the Eastern Parkway/Brooklyn Museum subway station to enrich the environment and to create an introduction to the museum above.  Among these are plaques, lunettes, keystones and other decorative elements that have long served, and continue to serve, to raise viewersÕ appreciation of the cityÕs architectural heritage.  As reinstalled here, they give visitors a foretaste of the riches of the museumÕs collections.

The entrance to the subway station was redesigned as a part of an enormous and ambitious project to improve the appearance and public access to the Eastern Parkway side of the museum.  As reoriented, it provides emerging passengers Ð many are visiting school children Ð a welcoming view of the new museum entry structure and public plaza in front of the building designed by Polshek Partnership Architects and completed in 2004.  The salvaged and repositioned architectural elements add to the transitional experience, drawing attention to the classical fa�ade of McKim, Mead and WhiteÕs original structure where similar elements appear.  

The project is an outstanding example of institutional collaboration.

The eye also observes the outside world and is part of a greater whole.  The elements for the eye Ð pupils, eyelashes Ð are ""drawn"" with buildings from the neighborhood, incorporating such landmarks as the Metropolitan, Guggenheim, and Whitney Museums, as well as Gracie Mansion.  The irises and whites of the eyes serve as a background for figurative elements that capture the diversity and vibrancy of the community.

According to the artist, 

These four murals depict the formation of the neighborhood around 86th Street.  This neighborhood, depicted by an eye, is the eye of the happy city.  This eye, which never sleeps, is part of a bigger organism Ð New York City.  

The [people of the city] have children and want the best for their children, so they tell them stories and fairy tales.  The fairy tales are the magic animals which appear to float in throughout the four murals.  In the end they form the carousel with the happy children of all nationalities enjoying the ride.  That is the future of the city.

Peter Sis grew up in Prague and was sent to the United States by the Czechoslovakian government in 1982 to make a film for 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.  He elected not to return when his government canceled the project and was granted asylum here, with the support of childrenÕs book author Maurice Sendak.

While most neighborhoods are filled with flower shops, they are particularly spectacular on the Upper East Side, where they can command a pretty penny for their wares.  KushnerÕs imagery captures the essence of a spring day.  Flowers are associated with many of the institutions in the neighborhood above Ð hospitals, parks, and museums.  

A painter, sculptor and printmaker, Kushner has always been fascinated by organic motifs.  He achieved fame in the 1970s for his forays into performance art, in which he often appeared in bizarre vegetable costumes, which many found the highlight of the performance.  A founder of the Pattern and Decoration Movement, he continues to feature vegetal motifs in his works, often along with geometric patterns and architectural shapes.  His work is clearly influenced by Chinese and Japanese art, in both subject matter and composition, and is also inspired by European and American artists such as Henri Matisse, Pierre Bonnard, Odilon Redon, and Georgia OÕKeeffe.  

The artist has a special affinity for the Upper East Side neighborhood where his work appears: ÒThis subway station is quite familiar to me Ð serving the Whitney Museum, the Metropolitan Museum, and also Lenox Hill Hospital (where all three of my children were born).  I feel these cumulative experiences have directly influenced my thoughts about what I would like to look at when entering the station.

It consists of vivid images silk-screened onto glass bricks and then joined together to form part of a colossal 370-foot Vista glass-brick wall.  In his proposal, Robert Wilson, the artist said, ÒI see a glass wall built as a celebration of life and joy containing all sorts of different images relating to the history of one of the greatest landmarks in the city, Coney Island.  ItÕs a place forever associated with optimism and entertainment and where people from all over the world gather for the same destination: fun.Ó

The popular image of Coney Island is of the amusement mecca where New Yorkers, before the age of air conditioning, went by the thousands to frolic in the surf and enjoy the roller coasters and other attractions.  But the neighborhood is and always has been much more than that Ð a vital residential and retail area independent of the amusements.  The images of My Coney Island Baby focus on this great variety, both the recreational attractions and the people who lived, worked and played there. 

Wilson is internationally known for his innovative projects, perhaps best for his work in experimental theater.  His formal background is in diverse disciplines; he studied painting, architecture, choreography and drama with leading teachers and practitioners in each field Ð for instance, George McNeil in painting, Paolo Soleri in architecture, and George Balanchine and Martha Graham in dance.  

As light conditions change, My Coney Island Baby does as well.  It responds equally well to sunlight during the day and to artificial light at night, from both inside and outside.  In daylight, with the sun streaming in from outside, its images and colors are boldly delineated.  At nighttime it mysteriously glows from within, adding an ephemeral quality to the surroundings.  Depending on the time of day, and on light conditions, it seemingly morphs from one state to another.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/my-coney-island-baby

The window-like work appears in the curved wall of the station, and it is successfully designed in tandem with the architects, FX + FOWLE to be seen as an integral part of it, not an add-on. The trapezoidal-shaped windows are fitted into the steel in such a way that they can be opened, so that air from the outside can be directed down into the subway, 45 feet below.

He has collaborated with major architects, including Cesar Pelli on the headquarters building for Owens-Corning in Toledo.  ÒThe ability of glass to occupy several physical states Ð transparent, opaque, dense, solid, weightless Ð all altering our spatial boundary Ð challenges me,Ó he says.  

The artist stresses the significance of the fact that all of PassageÕs components were handmade in his studio. This act of craftsmanship is critical, he says, as an indication that he controls the process to ensure the components are physically right, as well as to keep his hands on his work.

No longer.  Today Greenport is the hub of an ever-growing population boom of year-round and seasonal residents, as well as a place known for its acceptance of artistic expression. 

Anita Thacher is noted for her evocative light-works Ð art whose effect is created through the effects from electrical illumination.  Here she shows her range and versatility to best effect, utilizing numerous lighting techniques.  The stationhouseÕs roof is outlined with LED illumination in blue, and the area immediately surrounding the building is imbued with deeper blue light.  From inside the building comes a yellow glow suggesting candle light or gaslight.  On the station walls and on the roof, projected light forms images of an American Indian pictograph, to emphasize the importance of the first people to live on Long Island.

Anita Thacher is known for her multimedia installation, film, video, public art and photographic works. For this project, the artist did extensive research in local historical societies and libraries, locating photographs of the station house in its earlier days and information on white settlersÕ interaction with the Native American population, a longstanding interest of hers.

The cast aluminum sculptures are located on the steel structural elements that form the east and west fascias of the bridge that elevates the tracks of the station.  They are situated so as to be viewed both by commuters at the station and by pedestrians and drivers on the streets below. 

The artist, a Yonkers resident, consulted both art-historical and scientific sources to evoke the riverÕs past.  She has said of her approach:

As a public artist, I am especially interested in the biography of a specific location, the history and nature of a place, unearthing that history and telling its story through sculpture.  I want to link the past that gave way to the present and expose the connection between the community we know and share and what must have come before.

Segal was taken by the fact that the river in this area can actually flow upstream as well as down, depending on tidal conditions.  She explained to the Westchester Times: ÒThe work is an abstract representation of the river,Ó she said. ÒThe sun and moon will constantly change the lighting on the sculpture, and the shadows will change with the sunrise and sunset.Ó The sculpture is installed, the artist notes, at a spot where the riverÕs original shoreline was situated before landfill and development of the riverfront.  

Segal is a passionate advocate of public art.  As she said in her artist statement, ÒSince public art belongs to the community, it is important to me that the community feels connected to the piece, and not just on a theoretical, cultural level. É I determine the success of a piece based on how much fun children have playing on the sculptures.  I believe public art is obligated to provide that physical and literal interaction between the art and the community, and it is through that interaction that a relationship between art and the community is forged.Ó",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/muhheakantuck

At a time when images of the skyline can be associated with tragedy, Look Up, Not Down tries to reclaim the skyline as an image of hope and beauty.  The sun marks the former Wold Trade Center, reminding us that nothing is absolute,  In years to come, the city continues to reinvent itself, the mosaics will serve as a view of a vanished moment in time.Harvey's work includes video, installation art, and painting.  It is, she says, ""generally concerned with the theoretical and social implications"" of art.  In her 2001 New York Beautification Project she explored these concerns  in the streets, in a transgressive way but with redeeming social virtue; at forty sites throughout the city, she painted oval-shaped traditional landscape paintings-but all on top of defaced surfaces.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/look-up-not-down
NYCT,Woodlawn Av,4,Josie Gonzalez Albright,Children at Play,2005,faceted glass,"Josie Gonzalez-AlbrightÕs  Children at Play is a study of silhouette-like figures moving through space, stopping to observe, spinning, crouching, sliding, and running.  The artist says, ÒI arrived at a coloring for the children with jewel tones that would translate brightly to the stained glass.  The scale of the children Ð to each other and the space that theyÕre in Ð fills the frame with flowing colors that swirl around them.  The effect is that they Ômove through the colorsÕ of their environment. Warm shadows are created by placing ÔfritteÕ glass crystals fused over the glass, allowing for more flexibility and detail and adding a bubbly, raised texture.

In the words of Joy Taylor, the artist, ÒLeaves are so commonplace in nature that we rarely consider them worthy of study. Yet when looked at closely they reveal themselves as marvels of efficiency and beauty.  In a train station, time often means minutes to hurry, or to wait through.  But this mural allows the traveler an opportunity for a different view. Like a time line, this mosaic reveals nature as a vehicle of change. Combining nature and time, I encourage the viewer to examine such changes, and to appreciate the precious and fleeting quality of our world.

NYCT,116 St,6,Robert Blackburn,In Everything There Is A Season,2005,Glass mosaics,"Robert BlackburnÕs creation at 116th Street and Lexington Avenue evokes the local surroundings through dynamic abstract patterns that suggests the color and movement of the streets above rather than depicting the built environment.  They bring a timeless beauty into the transit environment. 

Of Jamaican ancestry, Blackburn was born in Summit, New Jersey, and spent his formative years in Harlem, where he worked with renowned African American artists Romare Bearden and Jacob Lawrence.  A master printmaker, Blackburn was known nationally for having profoundly affected American art by refocusing attention on printmaking, in particular through his Printmaking Workshop in Harlem, which he founded in 1948.  This was particularly so in the case of abstract color lithography.  Many students fondly remember him for his influence on them as teacher and mentor.  Romare Bearden spoke for a whole generation when, in A Tribute to Robert Blackburn, he said, ÒOne of the most outstanding facets of Robert BlackburnÕs character is his desire and willingness to help the people who are working with him.Ó  Blackburn died in April 2003, at age eighty-two.  

In 2001, MTA Arts for Transit commissioned Blackburn to create a work for the 116th Street and Lexington Avenue subway station in Harlem.  In failing health, he chose artist Mei-Tei-Sing Smith, a Bearden Fellow at the Printmaking Workshop, to assist him on what would prove to be his last major project.  Once completed, 30-by-40-inch maquettes were sent to Germany, where they were enlarged and manufactured into large ceramic and glass mosaics that today serve as a monument to BlackburnÕs bold use of color and masterful abstractions.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/in-everything-there-is-a-season
LIRR,Hempstead,Hempstead,Ron Baron,Lost and Found: An Excavation Project,2005,Cast bronze,"From afar, there appear to be slightly odd things happening at the Hempstead railroad station.  What is the strange stack of objects in what appears to be a carefully predetermined arrangement?  Some even seem to be in the form of seating.  Approaching closer, it becomes clear that the objects are old-fashioned trunks, suitcases, and briefcases.  But finally it dawns on one that they are not ordinary luggage after all, rather luggage cast in bronze and realistically painted.  And among these are other cast objects meant to remind riders of the communityÕs rich history.  This is Ron BaronÕs Lost and Found: A Hempstead Excavation Project.  

Among the Long Island-related treasures to be found in Lost and Found are an edition of Newsday featuring the Islanders winning the Stanley Cup, an NBA basketball (Julius Erving was from nearby Roosevelt), a Jets football reflecting the team practices at Hofstra University, and yearbooks from Hempstead High School highlighting community events, such as Martin Luther KingÕs address to students of the high school in 1968.  For good measure, and to enliven the work, Lost and Found also includes a miniature scene showing a Hempstead station vignette, with a train at the station, railroad personnel on the platform, and people boarding the train or waiting for another.  

Ron Baron refers to himself as a Òcultural archaeologistÓ; he amasses seemingly mundane objects from streets and sidewalks, thrift shops and garage sales.  He then forms his monuments, ÒgeologicalÓ constructs of his finds, which transform the objects into something completely new, cleverly commenting on our collective past.   A native of Springfield, Massachusetts, he graduated from the University of Wisconsin and received a Masters of Fine Arts from the University of California.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/lost-and-found

É On the surface, the variety of colors and shapes in the mosaics resemble collages and invite the traveler to consider the multiple layers of images found on city walls, particularly in the subway, where posters may tear, revealing previous images and forming exciting compositions.  These wonderful juxtapositions of forms and thoughts are consonant with the dynamics of a vital, urban environment, which, like a collage, is a multi-layered community of individuals whose diversity brings into relief the character of a city. É The glass is as diverse as the station Õs passengers, whose ethnic origins stem from Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.

Strange people strutting stranger clothes?  The theaters?  . . .  Whatever the case, chances are you will find it in Times Square: 35 Times and its multi-dimensional cartoon-like artworks scattered about the station.  

The artist, Toby Buonagurio, has lived in New York all her life.  She is particularly well known for her vividly colored offbeat ceramic work, which often has tongue-in-cheek or satirical overtones.  She has enjoyed numerous solo exhibitions and has received awards including the honor of being commissioned to do a work for the Shigaraki Ceramic Cultural Park in Japan.  The influences of Japanese figural works, theater, and ceramics shine through in her work, including this one.

Times Square: 35 Times has three main sub-themes Ð performing arts, fashion, and street life Ð that energize midtown Manhattan, and these are brought vividly to life by the artistÕs clever depictions of people, places, and objects that can be recognized by all.  BuonagurioÕs panels are installed in newly-designed illuminated shadowboxes that are featured in glass-block walls in various places throughout the station.

NYCT,W 8 St-NY Aquarium,"F, Q",Vito Acconci (Acconci Studio in collaboration with Daniel Frankfurt),Wavewall,2005,"Steel, ceramic tile, granite, fiberglass","The inspiration for the station's design was local sites - the historic Coney Island boardwalk and Cyclone roller coaster, the aquarium next to the station, and area beaches. The station is on the approximate site of a former roller coaster ride. The architect, Jim McConnell of Daniel Frankfurt, wanted to transform the exterior station walls in a unique way. Working with the architects, artist Vito Acconci developed an architectural treatment for the station fa�ade that is full of life. As in successful collaborations, there is no clear delineation between the architecture and the art. 

Before rehabilitation, the windscreens blocked ocean views; the new windscreens open up the platform view of the Atlantic Ocean. In the artist's words, ""The normally horizontal and vertical steel windscreen tubes and panels have been transformed into a more sinuous form that evokes the notion of a wave, or that of motion as in the Cyclone or the subway itself.""

Long known as the crossroads of the world, Times Square is famous for many things, but mostly for its crowds, particularly the spirited celebration each New Year's Eve when hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers and visitors-joined by television viewers around the world, gather to watch the ball drop to usher in the New Year. Sharing hopes for the future, the huge crowds are televised against a neon background.

In Revelers, Jane Dickson celebrates this age-old impulse to gather. Her mosaic artwork consists of approximately 70 expressive life-size figures. Each is in motion, walking, gesturing, linking arms, or dancing; all enjoying themselves and each other's company. The central frieze of figures are presaged by a scattering of figures in groups of two or three walking in both directions along the corridors that lead to the central open space of the station complex, near the stairs to the 1, 2, 3 lines. These smaller groups share the space with commuters traveling through the passageways that connect the subway stations at Seventh and Eighth Avenues.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/revelers
LIRR,Broadway,City Terminal Zone,Jean Shin,Celadon Remnants,2008,Celadon fragments and glass mosaic on retaining walls and station building,"Motorists, pedestrians, and commuters are the beneficiaries of the eloquent beauty of Celadon Remnants at the LIRR's Broadway Station in Flushing, Queens.

Using celadon fragments, artist Jean Shin created large-scale mosaic murals that feature the shapes and silhouettes of pottery. The mosaics are installed on the south stair walls (facing Northern Boulevard) and in architectural niches in the station building. The vessel or teapot forms were created from thousands of celadon fragments, hand-selected and donated by the city of Icheon, South Korea. The grayish-green forms against a white tile background create an abstract interplay between the positive and negative colored shapes. The aesthetic appeal of celadon lies in its eloquent beauty and simplicity. Derived from ancient China and perfected in Korea, celadon wares are among the most widely admired of Korean ceramics.

If a vessel is imperfect, it becomes scrap and there are mountains of fragments in the Icheon region of Korean. Shin was determined to use these cast-off fragments, and the artwork serves as a metaphor for the history, culture, and identity of the Asian population in Queens. For Shin, the thriving Asian-American communities neighboring the Broadway Station bea r resemblance to the Celadon Remnants - as each are transformed in a new location in a distinctively new form while preserving their cultural heritage.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/celadon-remnants

The title of the work relates to the specific journeys of the areas many residents, from Native Americans, through today's immigrant population and to the idea of travel and how one finds ones way.

The first two panels of the 11panels he created show the land inhabited by the Siwanoy Nation, a branch of the Mohicans, until the late 1600s, followed by representations of the first settlement of Europeans in the area. Cornerstones of the neighborhood are also shown: the Croton Aqueduct, St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church, and the Hall of Fame for Great Americans at Bronx Community College.

LIRR,Atlantic Terminal,City Terminal Zone,Allan & Ellen Wexler (in collaboration with di Domenico + Partners),Overlook,2009,Granite and glass,"The new MTA Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn features an artist/architect collaboration in a soaring, light-filled atrium. The project architects, di Domenico + Partners collaborated with the artists, Allan Wexler and Ellen Wexler, to create a special place of arrival in the entry pavilion which reaches from the street level down to the ticket office, waiting room and LIRR and NYC Transit subways.

The Wexlers created a two-story sculptural balcony and wall that visually evokes the adventure of travel. Titled Overlook, its rocky granite form cantilevers above the main concourse at the Terminal, referencing scenic overlooks often found in national parks, where travelers are encouraged to pause and take in the larger scene. The bands of granite also refer to nature found underground in layers of rock. Allan Wexler commented, ""We sought to create the experience of viewing an urban public space as if it were a nature setting, using granite tiles mathematically pixilated to create nooks and crannies found in rock walls."" Ellen Wexler said, ""We wanted to create a space where one can stop and take in the dynamic energy, which is as exciting as stopping to take in the Grand Canyon or other major vista"".

Overlook is framed by a pair of sweeping staircases and a glass and stainless steel balcony/railing that flows with the architecture of the space, which promises to be a Brooklyn landmark, akin to Grand Central Terminal's famous clock.

Allan Wexler and Ellen Wexler have created public art works nationwide, often using familiar forms imbued with new meanings and functions, fostering a new way of looking at or using the specific site. The materials used often are construction materials, as in the case of Overlook.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/overlook

The work exhibits the artist's interest in natural species and ways of arranging them in systems and patterns that highlight the connections and relationships between dissimilar species.

The artwork - created in glass mosaic based on Snead's original paintings - features species that have migrated to Brooklyn as well as one species that is departing. He arranges the species in layers that can be seen from left to right: European starling (originally from England), a house sparrow (Europe), Red Lion fish (Indian Ocean), Monk parrot (South America) and Koi (Japan).

The dots also transform the sunlight and enliven the landscape. Artist Carson Fox used bird and butterfly images inspired from Victorian era engravings, an aesthetic where natural life is a lush and swarming profusion.

A fused glass wall reveals images of tree limbs and leaves in silhouette adapted from photographic imagery. These formations relate to the place above, Battery Park, the historic fortress and Manhattan's southern boundary. The glass brings light and poetry to the station, the City's first new subway station in decades. 

Companion pieces show a decayed over-scaled leaf that refers to the passage of time and links the park to its historical role. A map, that shows contemporary Manhattan and old New York as an overlay, is a beautiful mosaic and eloquent expression of the city's evolution, conveying to the throngs who use the station, a sense of its significant location. The artists designed a laser-cut stainless steel fence to separate the entry from the paid section of the station; its leaf motif connects the art in the station with the surrounding environment. 

The Starns' work combines various forms, such as sculpture, painting, video, and installation. Their work has been exhibited in museums and galleries worldwide for more than two decades. In South Ferry, their explorations of light and dark, nature and technology, come together in an evocative artwork. Its title refers, among other associations, to the South Ferry subway line, which becomes a network of splitting lines that travels through the changing landscape as seen in the map. As the artwork reveals, the City and its lifelines evolve in an organic form, as dropping leaves lead to new growth, the City keeps growing - and changing.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/see-it-split-see-it-change

The photographs were translated into glass mosaic to capture the atmospheric progression and the iridescent quality of the evening sky. 
 
The 1,228-square-foot mosaic brings a romantic moment into an urban setting while welcoming riders to the community. Speaking about her inspiration for the new artwork, Harvey said, ÒEveryone knows Yankee Stadium as Ôthe Home of the StarsÕ but in the busy streets of the Bronx, where the city lights drown out the sky, itÕs easy to forget the real stars.

The artist created the proposal in 2004 and, working with Dattner Architects, selected the site in an expansive wall facing a double-wide stairway and landing that leads from the mezzanine to the platforms of the A, C, B, D and 1 trains. Titled Whirls and twirls (MTA), the artwork is 53 feet wide and by 11 feet high and consists of 250 porcelain tiles in six colors, each cut to meet the artist's specifications. The artist created the drawing/maquette for the project, reviewed and selected materials, and approved color samples prior to his death in 2007.

The artist is known for his sculptures and his wall drawings, in which detailed directions are provided for the execution of the artwork in paint or pencil. The site-specific piece - unique because it is a permanent public installation of a wall drawing - is a bravura work of precision, with swooping curves and vertical and horizontal bars in vibrant color that completely fills the space. The tile was cut to the exact dimensions of the drawing to ensure that the scale of the work and the color sequences are as the artist intended.

Sol LeWitt (1928-2007) is a celebrated artist who has had hundreds of solo exhibitions in museums and galleries worldwide since 1965. His work includes more than 1,100 wall drawings, photographs, hundreds of works on paper, and geometry-based sculptures.

The 1260 sq. ft. of relief panels fit within existing recesses in the viaduct. Tinted a terracotta color to harmonize with the sandstone color of the Ocean Parkway viaduct, a massive structure that carries the subway across six lanes of traffic and an Olmstead parkway, the reliefs portray scenes from the history and legends of Coney Island, including Neptune, a mermaid, beach, boardwalk, and amusement park scenes. The designs are based upon photographs, drawings, and interviews by the artist with local residents and visitors to the famed amusement park. On the north and south facing facades, there are six triangular shapes in which Neptune and the Mermaid repeat in paired groupings, as well as large rectangular panels at either end of the viaduct facade that feature scenes of Coney Island. 

The work is a visual gateway into Coney Island, and a major accomplishment that met many technical challenges. The figures and images are modelled with expression, reflective of the large-scale sculpture for which the artist is known and has exhibited widely.

The hanging sculptural work consists of 180 polished stainless steel flowers linked together and arranged in rows that flow from the structure's steel traverse beams, creating ethereal layers of reflective surfaces with an almost ghost-like presence.

The artists' intent is to reflect the community's historic roots as Bloomingdale, derived from the Dutch ""Bloemendaal"" - Vale of Flowers. The installation is a memento of nature past, reminding subway riders of a time before the area became an urban neighborhood, changing their perception of place for a few fleeting moments.

The organic arrangement of the flowers and their light and airy quality bring life to the soaring volume of the interior space. At night, ceiling lights cause the flowers to glimmer and the overall effect is a subtle yet lyrical evocation of the idea of gardens and light.

The work is based on paintings by Amy Bennett, whose artwork is based on the unique characteristics of the neighborhood's homes that offer a glimpse into the past. Captivated by the great estates and summer homes dating to the area's rural origins, the artist re-imagined the neighborhood in her mosaic artwork, building detailed 3-D replicas that served as still-life models for her painstakingly detailed paintings, from which the mosaics were interpreted.

She worked with fabricator Erksin Mitchell, who interpreted her artwork into three groupings of faceted glass panels. Each is a striking portrayal of organic ocean forms made radiant by the strong light that reflects off the nearby ocean.

Hirsch, inspired by childhood experiences, explores the universe beneath the seas through her artwork. As a child, she was fascinated by the family fish tank filled with creatures taken from the ocean. As a teenager, her interest was heightened when she began sailing and scuba diving. The variety and vibrancy of life beneath the surface continues to be a major interest to her.

With a love for the Rockaway landscape, Hirsch says the ocean is one of the most desirable places on earth.

NYCT,Beach 98 St,"A,S",Duke Riley,Be Good or Be Gone,2011,Faceted glass,"At the Beach 98th Street station, faceted glass artwork panels feature scenes, symbols, and the sea that surrounds the community. There are three groupings of five panels and two sets of diptychs. Artist Duke Riley has long been interested in maritime history, folklore, and local customs - particularly around New York's waterways. His work features the iconic view of the houses on stilts seen from the A train as it crosses Broad Channel. Situated on a pier, the homes are the only remaining bungalow housing pier of its kind in the City. Riley frames them with two bowline knots (a very strong knot commonly used to tie down the bow of a ship) to represent the strength and closeness within this community. Another set of five panels depicts a tugboat pulling a barge laden with recyclable glass. The tugboat was a based on a retired NYC tugboat that was docked near the artist's childhood home, and the depiction of glass in a glass artwork adds a layer of interest.

Riley uses nautical flags to spell out local phrases, like the ""Be Good or Be Gone"" sign seen in local taverns and for which the series of panels is titled and uses the phrase as a reminder for visitors to take care and appreciate the fragile environment of the area. One two-panel section shows two images of a piping plover - an endangered bird that has chosen a section of beach at the Rockaways, just a few blocks south of the station, as one of its few remaining nesting grounds. The other diptych has nautical flags above images of seaside bungalows that also bear a common Rockaway phrase, ""No Sniveling,'' which simply means no whining. In the past 150 years, Rockaway Beach endured destruction from storms and fire and - as is often is the case with waterfront communities - the unwavering determination to rebuild has shaped the resilient culture of the community.On the southbound platform, a five panel set shows the rolling sea filled with cast off and floating objects and even houses, as the artist comments on both the power of the sea and the need to respect it. The faceted glass artwork fabricated by Willet Hauser Architectural Glass employs special treatments, including metal rivets to mimic ship construction, hand painting, and etching. Glass crystals form stars above the stilt houses and other innovative uses of the medium are seen throughout the works.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/be-good-or-be-gone
NYCT,Beach 36 St,A,George Bates,Convergence 1&2,2011,Glass blocks,"A dominant theme in George BatesÕ work is convergence and how nature, objects, and people meet and form a greater whole. If you view only the individual components of the whole you may fail to see the larger ideas and systems to which they are connected. At B.36th Street, he designed a lyrical composition with a bold, yet playful spirit, that expresses his feelings about the Rockaways. Created in glass block in the station stair landings, the glass brings in light and brightens the station. The design on the south bound side, which receives the strongest light, features a spiral formed of peopleÕs heads, rendered in deep blue and heavy line. These are profiles that overlap one another, building up and snowballing into a large element, a community. This main section is accented by bursts and waves of color, pops of yellow among strikes of blue and occasional reds. Different elements were designed to reveal themselves at closer viewing. From afar the works reads as one unified design.

The northbound side of the station also has a large circular form; here it is bands of waving color set among abstracted and small scale geometric patterns. In the rhythm and flavor of the work, Bates shows his expertise as an artist who is best known for a vivid and animated style. Here he distills the essence of the beach side community that surrounds Beach 36 Street Ð with a spirited joyous rendition that achieves its musical like title, with its waves and crescendos of color, pattern and form.

The art will resonate over time with riders making their daily commute to and from the station. In addition, the strong ocean light will project through the thick glass and the bands of color, creating colorful shadows that change as the sun passes overhead. At night the glass block artwork will appear to glow from within due to the stationÕs mezzanine interior light.

Bates is familiar with the neighborhood and the state of mind found in New York CityÕs beachfront string of neighborhoods. An avid surfer, he has been a regular visitor for over twenty years, forming bonds with locals and the landscape, in which he is pleased to have a hand, in his permanent artwork at the station.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/symphonic-convergence-1-2
NYCT,Beach 67 St,A,Ingo Fast,On and Off the Boardwalk,2011,laminated glass,"Ingo Fast's series of 17 laminated glass panels for the Beach 67th Street station at Arverne in the Rockaways, Queens, is divided between the two platforms. Fast creates amusing figures and landscapes, rendered in thin lines, washed in color, and seen from unusual vantage points.

For this project he created a series of drawings that feature scenes from the neighborhood: families going to the beach, a roller coaster ride from the days of Rockaway Playland, which was located nearby, fireworks, and lazy summer days. As counterpoint, a pair of panels shows an ice skater enjoying the deserted beach community, still bright and vibrant under a winter sky .",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/on-and-off-the-boardwalk
NYCT,Wall St,"4,5",James Garvey,Lariat Tapers,2011,Forged and polished bronze seat rests,"Artist James Garvey hand forged functional bronze sculptures and designed them to literally integrate into the stationÕs architecture. The nine sculptural Lariat Tapers wrap around the Tuscan columns at the historic Wall Street station. Since the station is located in the financial district, Garvey crafted these functional seats to convey the location of the wind-swept Òcorridors of financeÓ. The tapers swirl in a clockwise direction around the columns to depict the motion of trains swooping into the station. Comparing the Lariat Tapers to GarveyÕs precedent artwork Lariat Seat Loops sited at the 33rd Street Station (6), the Lariat Tapers are realized as a more sensuous form, a deliberate attempt to interact with and catch the attention of commuters who work in the financial district. At the 33rd Street Station, the dynamic between the Seat Loop and the historic I-beam column imparts a uniquely fresh impression, while GarveyÕs design for the Wall Street Station acknowledges, respects, and highlights the stationÕs history and architecture.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/lariat-tapers
NYCT,Avenue U,"B,Q",Jason Middlebrook,Brooklyn Seeds,2011,Glass or ceramic mosaic,"Jason Middlebrook's mosaic installation, ""Brooklyn Seeds,"" is a monumentally-scaled garden of wildflowers climbing up the stair wall extending from Avenue U to the elevated train platform. Created in glass mosaic, the choice of plants is based upon local wildflowers that grow in unlikely places, through cracks in the sidewalk, alleys, and walls. Middlebrook's work explores the place where the urban and manmade intersect with the natural to survive and flourish. These flowers, often weeds, include such local specimens as spotted knapweed, burdock, golden rod, aster, milkweed and daises. Above many of the mosaic plants are airborne seed pods floating away to germinate, on a journey of their own.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/brooklyn-seeds
NYCT,Far Rockaway-Mott Av,A,Jason Rohlf,Respite,2011,Tempered and laminated art glass,"New glass artwork at the Mott Avenue terminal building brings brightness, color, and stature to the building, which received a new interior and easier access. The opportunity to create art throughout the terminal headhouse provided the artist with a large canvas to realize his vision, and the strong light that surrounds the terminal made glass the medium of choice.

Artist Jason Rohlf created original paintings for the project, which were translated into hand-painted laminated glass panels, and treated to achieve the artistÕs preference for a textured, multi-layered appearance. The artwork is visible to all who enter or leave the station Ð and on both sides of the elevated platform where it meets the stairs and elevator. The art encompasses the NYC transit station, beaming light and color throughout the architectural space.

Respite is an abstract landscape of birds perched on outstretched branches. The colors in the birds blend into the branches, symbolizing the connection between people and their community The series of luminous glass panels features three distinct color themes (green for dawn, blue for midday and orange for dusk) and relate to the strong links between nature and light in this seaside community.

ÒAs an artist, this project was a fantastic opportunity to really impact the architecture and create work that serves to connect the viewers with the surrounding landscapeÓ, said Jason Rohlf. The colors in the glass reflect into shadows that splash throughout the station, providing a welcome and vibrant addition to the riderÕs experience.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/respite
NYCT,Elder Av,6,Jean Whitesavage and Nick Lyle,Bronx Trees,2011,Forged Steel,"Bronx Trees consist of 20 hand wrought steel sculptural grilles, representing a number of the native tree species of the Bronx River area. Installed within the platform windscreen, the grilles provide views to the buildings, streets and neighborhood below. Branches and leaves lend a treetop feeling to the view.

The Southbound platform displays grilles based on leaves and branches of the Shagbark Hickory tree (Carya ovate) and the Sassafras (Sassafras albidum). The Northbound platform includes grilles based on leaves and branches of Sumac (Rhus typhina), Swamp White Oak (Quercus bicolor), Tulip (Liriodendron tulipifera) and Tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica) trees. These trees were common in the forest that covered the Bronx until the mid -19th century when land development began for the creation of farms, highways, and industry. Today, various local organizations are working to replant native plants, revive the waterways and bring back a bit of the forest.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/bronx-trees
NYCT,Beach 44 St,A,Jill Parisi,Coom Barooom,2011,Glass block,"At the Beach 44 Street station, artist Jill Parisi used the scale allowed by walls of glass block to create imaginary sea creatures. In resplendent colors and intricate patterns they appear to float on the glass. These hybrid species are inspired by an unusual marine anomaly nearby, where the Gulf Stream carries various tropical fish to the region. Parisi referenced botanical cross-sections, jellyfish, sting rays, and triggerfish, in order to create the original works on paper that were later translated into the glass medium. These over-scaled and overlapping shapes and the play of sunlight on the glass create the sensation that you are looking underwater.

The subject matter is appropriate for a station that is situated in front of the ocean, in an area discussed as a future marine preserve. The strong sunlight that reaches the southbound mezzanine fills the station as light is refracted through the glass blocks, causing the entire wall to glow. In the evening the wall is illuminated from within, providing an outdoor view of the artwork.

Parisi titled the work after a passage from William Carlos WilliamsÕ prose poem, Spring and All, which contains many playful singsong lines including Ôcoom barrooom-Ô, which mimics the sound of crashing waves.

Parisi works mostly with handmade paper, using drawing and printmaking to create large-scale installations and small sculptures. Many of her prints and drawings are delicate hand painted works inspired by organic forms. In commenting on the experience of creating this work, she said, ÒI am very interested in creating a feeling of lightness and beauty for the viewer. I have also wanted to work in a more permanent medium for some time, and as a result of this project I have realized that glass in very fitting for my work. It interacts beautifully with architecture and nature.""",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/coom-barooom
NYCT,E 180 St,"2,5",Luisa Caldwell,Station Villa,2011,Laminated Glass and Mosaic,"Inspired by the historic 1912 Italianate villa structure of the station and its proximity to the Bronx Zoo, Luisa Caldwell created a series of colorful and lively artworks with references to classical beauty, reflective of the architectural style of the original building.

Fifteen unique and site-specific pieces are placed throughout the station.

Above the doorway entrance, there are three lush and vibrant floral bouquets with an elk and elephant welcoming the traveler and serving as a Bronx Zoo reference. Along the corridor, mosaic and glass artworks are on opposite walls. In the windows, glass panels reflect the arches of the historic station, flowers, and vines, creating an illusion of depth and light. On the walls, mosaic frames of silver mirror reflect the thematic arches and complete an effect of calmness sought by the artist, who follows feng-shui principles.

These works are balanced with five additional mosaics within the station. Two are located next to the stairs and portray small creatures and vases reminiscent of the niche bouquets at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Along the East 180th Street corridor that serves as a station exit, there are three more mosaics created with a blend of stones that echo the massive rock outcroppings found throughout the Bronx. A colorful peacock and lizard sit on the rocks, looking like they are taking a break from the nearby zoo.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/station-villa
NYCT,Neck Rd,Q,Mary Temple,"West Wall, East Light, Morning",2011,Glass or ceramic mosaic,"Mary Temple's artwork subtly shifts the commuter's perception of the subway station by creating a soft canopy of light and shade that floods the wall of the west stair leading up to the southbound platform. The standard wall tile has been tinted, transitioning from rectangular shapes to smaller angular shapes to form an elaborate fractured mosaic. Over the pattern of shapes, it appears that a shard of light and tree silhouettes illuminate the wall. On closer inspection viewers discover that the tiles are hand-painted in ceramic glazes. This slow reveal of the image was designed by the artist, to be discovered over time, on repeated viewing, as commuters catch a glimpse of perpetual morning light. As the artist reminds us, Henry David Thoreau said: ""Vigorous thought keeps pace with the sun, the day is a perpetual morning"". The artwork may not be immediately noticed as it subtly plays with the viewer's perception of the space, and will lead to ongoing discovery and enjoyment as its mysteries are revealed.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/west-wall-east-light-morning
Metro-North,Rye,New Haven,Matt Mullican,Untitled,2011,ceramic mosaic,"The subject of Matt Mullican's artwork is renowned Modernist architect and designer Marcel Breuer who was the original architect of the Rye Station building. Breuer's use of modular elements and simple forms, repeated and combined to dramatic effect, made him one of the most influential and innovative architects of his time. This mosaic honors Breuer's work and incorporates views of buildings he designed, with their characteristic bold use of light and shadow. His iconic furniture and design are also featured.

For over three decades, Mullican has created a complex body of work about systems of knowledge, meaning, language, and signification. His visual language uses graphics and sign systems to communicate with the viewer, who is taken on an exploration through the work. Mullican is concerned with the relationship between perception and reality, between the ability to see something and the ability to represent it. Mullican's oeuvre, which takes form as drawing, collage, video, sculpture, performance, and installation, investigates how we understand what we see, in essence creating a 'picture' of the world. At Rye Station, he lets Marcel Breuer's works speak for themselves, using selected views and samples to create a composition that both honors and reveals new insights into the architect.

The following Breuer works are included in this mosaic:

1. Hunter College, Bronx, NY 1957 - 60.

NYCT,Beach 25 St,A,Mauricio Lopez,Past/Present/Future,2011,Faceted glass,"Through Past/Present/Future, Mauricio Lopez distills his perception of the RockawayÕs landscape with its streets and buildings that are framed by the continuous change of colors and textures of open sky, ocean, and bay.

Past and Present are depicted through a variation of light and seasonal colors and abstract shapes of the landscape. Future is reflected by new developments and the environment, reflected through different levels of transparency in the glass. The various layers present both a timeline and an organic portrayal of the community.

In creating the artwork, Mauricio was inspired by the powerful natural setting of the Rockaways that has provided life for centuries and attracted many to move to the area in the last 150 years. As people from Rockaway may say, ÒOnce you get sand in your shoes, youÕll come back.Ó LopezÕs artwork honors those who have lived and live in the Rockaway and their tenacity and commitment to their community.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/past-present-future
NYCT,Beach 90 St,A,Michael Miller,Surf Station 90,2011,Faceted glass,"Michael Miller's faceted glass panels celebrate the adventure of surfing, which is appropriate for the location, B. 90th Street, which is a City of New York designated surfing beach. Miller created a series of paintings in vivid, bold color reminiscent of 60's surf posters and music album covers, that evoke the mood of sitting inside a wave and looking toward shoreline, or the splash of the sea, or figures on a surfboard. His work is expressive and energetic in its line and movement, the perfect start or finish to a day at the beach, and a welcome burst of color to commuters in this Rockaway neighborhood.

The expressive nature of faceted glass has been maximized to use optical effects and hand painting to bring Miller's artwork to life. As construction progresses, additional panels will be installed on the south bound platform of the station.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/surf-station-90
NYCT,Avenue M,Q,Rita MacDonald,Hare Apparent,2011,Glass or ceramic mosaic,"Artist Rita MacDonald works with everyday patterns in much of her work, manipulating and enlarging the shapes to fit architectural spaces in her installations and painstakingly rendering each line in her prints. Often her patterns are based upon fabrics from old clothes or well-worn curtains. In her two-station project on the Brighton Line, she puts these practices to good use, creating a trompe l'oiel effect in which the tile wall is folded back like a curtain to reveal a vintage wallpaper-like pattern behind. The fabricator, Miotto Mosaics, faced a challenging technical puzzle of trimming rectangular tiles to resemble an unfurling form so that it seem as though an invisible hand has peeled back a layer of the wall.

MacDonald wanted to create the effect of a remodeling in progress, honoring the station rehabilitation process, and created an updated craftsman-era pattern that references the historic homes in the Midwood community. In her words, ""The revealed pattern is a decidedly more pastoral pattern - inspired in color, form, and design both by the residential nature of the neighboring streets and by pattern design from the beginning of the twentieth century, the time at which the station was originally built. I'm interested in the intersection of these two patterns as a metaphor for the idea that architecture and space can be holders of our collective memory.""

Avenues J and M share this metaphoric motif. Avenue M features a rabbit design with rabbits leaping from the wall and hopping along the station stairs. Avenue J depicts birds who fan out from the pattered wall and seem to fly throughout the station. The creatures appear to have escaped from the old- fashioned wall pattern of the past to join us here in the present day station. The birds and rabbits add a sense of whimsy while at the same time engaging people who use their own forms of transportation. In an inspired flight of fancy, the animals travel to the neighboring stations: a bird is seen mixing it up with the rabbits at Avenue M and at Avenue J, a rabbit hops over to visit with the birds.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/bird-laid-bare-hare-apparent

NYCT,Beach 60 St,A,Simon Levenson,The Beaches of New York City,2011,Glass Blocks,"Artist Simon Levenson paints figures at the beach in various poses in this work, which has the benefit of strong light that comes from the nearby beach being depicted. Levenson creates his figures serially, so they may be read in sequence as one reads a story. The southbound side of the station faces the ocean and has the brightest light and contains two large panels with larger than life-size figures filling the space amid the cool blue of the ocean. On the northbound side, the glass block contains a sequence of smaller vignettes that extend from sand to the sea in one long band. The view of the sequence depends upon the transit ridersÕ path going up to or down from the elevated platform.

The artwork was created in glass block which is located in the mezzanine area which is above the street and below the platform. The fabrication technique echoed LevensonÕs brushwork, with hand painting of the individual half-blocks, which were then laminated to clear blocks. The resulting work is durable and allows light to come though. In the evening the illuminated interiors will light the work so it can be seen by those approaching the station.

The figures Ðmany are children with their mothers- are seen in free and unguarded moments of delight that often comes as the sand meets the surf. Levenson has long painted such beach scenes and speaks of his childhood memories at the beach, Òwhere lifeÕs greatest and smallest dramas play out on a daily basis.""",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/beaches-of-new-york-city
NYCT,Parkchester,6,William Low,A Day in Parkchester,2011,Faceted Glass,"A Day in Parkchester, created by artist William Low, features two picturesque, iconic day and night scenes of the neighborhood with a day and night view. Fabricated into 40 faceted glass panels, the monumental 11 feet high windows are located in the two stairwells leading from the mezzanine to the platform, filling the space with light and color.

The main characters are the sun and the moon, placed high above the Bronx cityscape with rolling hills, beautiful old apartment buildings, and green parks. Intrigued by the idea that commuters pass by the windows at different times of the day and the effect of the changing light from morning to night, Low created the artwork with the idea in mind that commuters pass by the windows at different times of the day. Light and the location became both the subject matter and focal point. The windows capture the daily light beautifully throughout the day, receiving the stronger daytime rays in the morning and the softer light in the evening hours. The colorful glass provides commuters with the opportunity to view and enjoy its effect throughout the day.

Low was born and raised in the Bronx and was inspired by the station design, and incorporated elements of the original mosaic frieze into his work. The artist has fond memories of riding the subway while growing up in the Bronx.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/day-in-parkchester
NYCT,25 Av,D,Amy Cheng,Rediscovery,2012,Laminated glass,"Amy ChengÕs series of four windscreen compositions are designed as imaginative land and skyscapes representing mystery and adventure. They refer to the largeness of life, the wonders and mystery of the natural world, rendered in resplendent color and form.

As an immigrant, Cheng feels a deep affinity with the West End D Line neighborhoods, particularly the work ethic and diversity of the residents. A Turkish restaurant sits cheek-by-jowl with a Japanese restaurant, which faces a Spanish bodega, which shares the sidewalk with a Chinese green grocer, who faces an Italian bakery, who neighbors an Afghan restaurant, and so on. It is as if the places of business were proclaiming in unison: ÒWe come from all over the globe, we have chosen to make our living in this corner of Brooklyn, and we want to share the riches of our culture and cuisine with you.Ó

Whether from this year or 100 years ago, it takes courage for immigrants to leave the safety of the familiar and set out for the greater unknown world.

NYCT,62 St,D,Andrea Dezsš,Nature Rail,2012,Stainless steel,"Nature Rail, created by Andrea Dezsš, is a stainless steel sculptural work installed in the railings of the stationÕs transfer areas connecting the D with the N line. Nature Rail is composed of five modular compositions by DezsšÕs which can be combined depending on the location and configuration of the station railings.

The plant and animal life that survives on its own, in the urban environment surrounding the elevated train captured DezsšÕs imagination and served as the central theme of Nature Rail. PlantsÑtrees, vines, flowers, and small, wild animalsÑgrasshoppers, bees, birds and rabbits, are depicted in silhouetted details using laser cut-out with sandblasted finishes. The resulting work resembles the traditional paper cut, a popular folk art medium familiar to many of the ethnic groups who make Bensonhurst their home. For Dezsš, Chinese cut paper art may differ from Italian, Jewish or Mexican decorative and folk cut paper art, yet there are common elements among each, including natural subjects and varying degrees of symmetry. With her work, she creates a delightful visual focal point, which can be seen by all who enter the station as well as those on the street below.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/nature-rail
NYCT,9 Av,D,Christopher Russell,Bees for Sunset Park,2012,Bronze gates and decorative elements,"Christopher RussellÕs artwork is centered on the image of the bee. The artist imagined the station as a kind of beehive, a center of activity, with many individuals converging, like bees, darting in and out, to and from their many pursuits. The historic building with its central entrance and peaked roof evokes the feeling of a beehive. The artist found the image of the bee as an appropriate motif since the stationÕs architecture is inspired by the Arts and Crafts style. During the Arts and Crafts period, artists and designers utilized the bee, the hive, and honeycomb extensively, in the decorative wall coverings, objects and furnishings.

Incorporating this imagery, Russell designed 2 sets of gates and finials for the fences that surround the open spaces at each side of the station. The cast bronze gates are based on honeycombs, greatly magnified. These monumental honeycombs are populated by equally magnified bees depicted in their crowds, busily occupied. The cells of the honeycomb are open, allowing light to pass through, and bringing out the hexagonal pattern of the comb, which creates depth and visual interest, when viewed from a distance.

The finials, atop each the tallest posts along the fences, feature a single bee, larger than life, working on an equally exaggerated flower head. The bees are intended as an affirmation of nature in the city, reminding passers-by of their fertility, productivity, and community. The artwork was fabricated by Modern Art Foundry.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/bees-for-sunset-park
NYCT,50 St,D,Dan Zeller,Internal Connectivity,2012,Laminated glass,"Bay 50th station is adjacent to John Dewey High School and is one station away from Coney Island, which provides a natural setting for Dan ZellerÕs detailed and intricate abstract drawings to address the connectivity of lives in an urban environment. Zeller studied satellite imagery, local streets, and biological systems along the West End Line (D) and interpreted them into abstract patterns. Six drawings were recreated in luminous color in laminated glass panels installed along the platform windscreens.

As the artistÕs response to the site, these colorful images have an organic quality that is in concert with the green space next to the station and the nearby bay area. In his drawings, Zeller introduces colors and curvilinear elements to the rigid structure of the elevated train line, as it sweeps through the Brooklyn terrain. Among the drawings, the satellite view of Brooklyn surrounding the Bay 50th Street station may be most recognizable in some compositions. Others reflect varying degrees of abstraction that evolved from the satellite drawing and related images. The work represents an artist keenly aware of his surroundings and who makes it his own, as he illuminates and highlights the ways in which infrastructure, nature, and human activity interact and evolve.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/internal-connectivity
NYCT,Avenue H,Q,Ed Kopel,Brooklyn Bucolic,2012,Bronze,"The landmarked Station House at Avenue H in Midwood, Brookyln was originally built at the turn of the century as a real estate office for the surrounding community of Fiske Terrace, an early example of planned suburban development and a neighborhood which is graced by well-kept homes and landscaped streets. When the station was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2004, the Commission wrote that Avenue H is Òthe cityÕs only shingled wooden cottage turned transit station house"". To celebrate this uniquely charming site, artist Ed Kopel animates the exterior of the building with his new piece, Brooklyn Bucolic, transforming an unused colonnade into an active community porch.

The artwork, along the north and east fa�ades of the Station House, consists of casual groupings of cast bronze rocking chairs, anchored in place. The chairs are modeled upon rockers produced by the Shaker Community in Mount Lebanon, New York during last quarter of the 19th Century and the first quarter of the 20th Ð a timeframe contemporaneous with the development of Fiske Terrace from the establishment of the Brighton Line in 1878 to the completion of home construction in the 1920Õs. Each has a unique patina treatment to make them more inviting and appropriate to a cozy porch setting.

The chairs vary in size accommodating a variety of users and suggesting a dialogue among them. Each chair, though similar in style to one another, is subtly different with a variety of weaves, colors and patterns. The colors of the rocking chairs recall and harmonize with the decorative hues of the surrounding Queen Anne and Colonial houses. Brooklyn Bucolic is, in part, an effort to recall the graciousness of front-porch society from days gone by. The chairs were fabricated by JP Parnas Woodworking and Polich Tallix.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/brooklyn-bucolic
NYCT,18 Av,D,Francesco Simeti,Bensonhurst Gardens,2012,Laminated glass,"Bensonhurst Gardens depicts imaginary landscapes comprised of native plants with an unexpected array of flowers growing side by side. Simeti selected plants and flowers that are culturally meaningful to the three main ethnic groups currently found in Bensonhurst: Chinese, Italian, and Jewish. The 32 laminated glass panels were created through a process of collage.

One of these examples includes the rose and lilly which reference the Santa Rosalia Festival which is highly celebrated in the neighborhoods served by the station. The artistÕs aim is not to make the individual panels immediately recognizable to a specific culture but to function as a framework, creating surreal compositions that belong to different times, cultures and habitats. In addition, SimetiÕs Òlight-boxÓ compositions comment on societyÕs relationship to nature by showing the soil which nurtures the plants also collecting societyÕs cast-off detritus.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/bensonhurst-gardens
Metro-North,Tarrytown,Hudson,Holly Sears,Hudson River Explorers,2012,Laminated glass,"Inspired by this great riverÕs majesty and informed by the regionÕs rich history of discovery, exploration, and travel, Hudson River Explorers by artist Holly Sears, features 11 laminated glass panels fabricated by Tom Patti Design, in the newly constructed South and North Overpass corridors at the Tarrytown Metro-North Station.

With allusions to the romanticism of the Hudson River School of painting, SearsÕ exquisitely rendered views of six above-water and five underwater riverscapes are populated by groups of creatures. The scenes are fantastic, magically real, yet firmly grounded in naturalism. From east to west, the panels in each overpass create the experience of one dayÑfrom dawn to dusk with light, color and subject. The masterfully painted plants and animals in this watery, dreamy realm include an unexpected combination of native and exotic speciesÑa bobcat and house cat, polar bears and black bears, white-tailed deer, ducks, shad, seahorse and sturgeon, hawks and owls, herons and swallows, elephants and horses. Sears places a particular emphasis on those animals that are threatened or endangered enjoining us to consider and protect the natural world that surrounds us.

The trip down the length of the corridor is one of discovery, and an analog to the explorersÕ experience depicted in the scenes. The viewer will witness the passage of time through the transition of light and color in the sky and river, and the astonishing variety of plants and animals that inhabit each scene offers intrigue and imaginative contemplation.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/hudson-river-explorers
NYCT,71 St,D,Joan Linder,The Flora of Bensonhurst,2012,Laminated glass,"Elevated stations of Bensonhurst provide a dramatic opportunity for glass artwork at the platform level. Joan linder created drawings of flora based upon wild vegetation seen from the streets and lots within a 6-block radius of the 71st Street station. The result is an elegant, dynamic and specific tribute to the landscape of Bensonhurst, which endures, among other things, as an echo of BrooklynÕs past. These panels act as windows to a lost historyÑa place shaped by Native Americans and farmers. The botanical images offer passengers an experience that is a counterpoint to the built environment of the city.

Entitled The Flora of Bensonhusrt, the work is composed of six intricate drawings of plants flowing in the direction of train. Three on each platform, the plants rendered in cool colors (blue, green and purple) on the Manhattan bound platform alert the riders as they venture out in the morning. Whereas, those in warm colors (red, turquois, and orange) are placed on the Brooklyn bound platform to greet the commuters as they make their way home from work.

For the project, Linder painstakingly created large scale drawings in pen and ink on paper, which then be scaled and translated into laminated glass. The plants against a milky white background resemble a lightbox, which are constantly shifting under the daylight and also viewable at night from the street level.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/flora-of-bensonhurst
Metro-North,Peekskill,Hudson,Joy Taylor,Jan Peeck's Vine,2012,Various,"Jan PeeckÕs Vine was inspired by the natural beauty surrounding Peekskill Station, recreating local indigenous bindweed plants as imaginative structures that morph from rigid girders into flowing, soaring leaves and flowers.

The artwork (named for the areaÕs first European resident for whom Peekskill is named) begins with a pair of painted steel sculptures on the southbound platform that echo the historic elements of the existing station and free them to run riot in a flowing, whimsical overhead design. From their bases, they grow to the canopy roof surrounding two supporting columns in a zig-zag pattern that replicates the lacing of the historic northbound canopy. As they climb up the columns, they begin to curve and twine, transforming into vines. Their stylized forms twist around the upright columns, finally breaking free into an organic design that fills the space above the entry.

The vines proceed from each side in a roughly symmetrical pattern, meeting over the stairs like a huge arbor welcoming visitors to a vast local garden. Elements of this sculpture are repeated in the two Peekskill monograms atop the elevator entrances and in railing inserts on the northbound platform. The vivid colors and repeating shapes provide a modern, stylized take on historic elements of the station and surrounding architecture. Symbolizing the flowering of the contemporary arts in this historic city, Jan PeeckÕs Vine welcomes commuters to their historic station. Joy TaylorÕs artwork was fabricated by KC Fabrications.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/jan-peecks-vine
NYCT,Broadway-Lafayette St / Bleecker St,"6,B,D,F,M",Leo Villareal,Hive (Bleecker Street),2012,"LED tubes, custom software, electrical hardware, aluminum, stainless steel","Hive (Bleecker Street) is a light installation for the Bleecker Street Station by Leo Villareal. The LED sculpture takes the form of a honeycomb, dramatically filling an architectural space in the shape of an ellipse above the stairs that marks the new transfer point connecting the IRT and IND subway lines. The enormous ceiling, hovering overhead, becomes a type of illuminated diagram as vivid colors, outlining each hexagonal honeycomb shape, move across the sculpture. Villareal created an unprecedented art experience for transit riders who use the station, in its use of technology and LEDs.

Hive (Bleecker Street) has a playful aspect in its reference to games. Riders will be able to identify individual elements within a larger context and track this movement. The work explores the compulsion to recognize patterns and the brainÕs hard coded desire to understand and make meaning. The patterns also take inspiration from the research of the mathematician John Conway who invented the Game of Life, the best-known cellular automata program. Hive (Bleecker Street) speaks to a diverse audience - it is abstract and evocative and can have many different meanings. It creates an experience for riders through changing patterns presented in randomized progression. Overall, the piece resonates with the activity of the station, transportation network and the city itself. The work was fabricated by Parallel Development.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/hive-bleecker-street
NYCT,20 Av,D,Odili Donald Odita,Kaleidoscope,2012,Laminated glass,"Kaleidoscope, created by Odili Donald Odita, is a laminated glass installation spanning throughout the elevated station platforms, which cross the commercial street and neighborhood hub of 20th Avenue.

Odita is known for creating site-specific wall painting and installations that use abstract color patterns as a personal response to and visual memory of the specific site. Odita shares his percpetions of the Bensonhurst neighborhood in his choice of color and patterns in the artwork. He was particularly aware of the changes in this neighborhood since the 1990s and its parallels to the evolution of communities in general. Impressions of the neighborhood became his major inspiration in the design and the color palette for Kaleidoscope.

Composed of forty panels of vibrant color patterns in an invigorating diagonal movement, the formation of bold to pastel colors in Kaleidoscope exists similarly to the way that color exists in quilts, creating patterns and visual interest while symbolizing the many individual elements it takes to compose a unified whole, in this case, a community. Odita also sought to have the work represent the vitality and diversity within the neighborhoodÕs businesses. Kaleidoscope represents the vitality of its location at the 20th Avenue subway, and like the subway itself, resonates throughout the City.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/kaleidoscope
NYCT,Fort Hamilton Pkwy,D,Portia Munson,Gardens of Fort Hamilton Parkway Station,2012,Laminated Glass,"The Gardens of Fort Hamilton Parkway Station are six sets of flower compositions in laminated glass which bring elements of nature onto the subway platform. Artist Portia Munson created the work from digital scans of actual flowers that are realized as larger than life to create fantastical gardens. Each composition represents a garden at different times in the growing season. The first, Double Happiness, represents early spring. The second grouping, Peony is made up of flowers that bloom from late spring in May. The third, July, depicts mid-summer and the fourth, Hibiscus, shows flowers commonly seen toward the end of August. The last gardens are Morning Glory created in September and October, illustrating a garden in late Fall. These six different gardens are comprised of flowers that can be seen growing in Brooklyn.

Each image appears like an aerial plan of imagined flower gardens. Using arrangements inspired by mandalas, representing the universe, the flowers have been placed into orbiting combinations of color and shape, preserving what was in bloom on the day that the images were created. The large fantastical flower beds are meant to function as meditation garden for subway travelers.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/gardens-of-fort-hamilton-parkway-station
NYCT,79 St,D,Susanna Starr,A Continuous Thread,2012,Laminated glass,"A Continuous Thread created by Susanna Starr was inspired by the lace doily that has particular significance to the predominantly Italian-American community in the Bensonhurst neighborhood. Lace doilies are iconic images of home. Passed from one generation to the next, connecting the past, present, and future, the colorful laces evoke home and belonging while referencing traditional handcrafts and cultures in the neighborhood such as Chinese paper cuts and Latin American textiles. Accompanying the artwork is a poem by Susan B. Auld, titled In the Shadow of the Design, which Starr considers an important element of the artwork.

In the medium of glass, each of the doilies is made up of two identical layers of brightly colored lace pattern, which were then meticulously positioned to reveal one from another. The effect of the layering adds a physical dimension and depth. The layered laces shift and change when seen from different angles, and as the light changes throughout the day. Though the images are based upon vintage lace doilies, the color combinations of the windows are graphic and modern. As a counter-balance to the landscape of the subway platforms, these large scale and at the same time, intimate domestic objects, act as visual anchors that hover delicately within the station windscreens, a continuous layering of thread.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/a-continuous-thread
NYCT,Hunters Point Av,7,Tricia Keightley,Hunters Point Project,2012,Glass mosaic,"Installed on the wall of the stationÕs Manhattan bound platform, Hunters Point Avenue Project by artist Tricia Keightley merges elements of Hunters PointÕs industrial past with its future, in her composition that creates a machine of her imagination.

Fabricated in glass mosaic by Miotto Mosaic Art Studios, the artwork features contemporary and historic turnstiles in the form of radiating flowers. The radiating form on the left is built of a multitude of modern turnstiles symbolizing the act each rider makes when entering and exiting the station. The form on the right is comprised of the turnstiles used in 1916 when the station first opened. Together, they reflect almost a century of service the station has provided.

Additionally, the industrial elements, attaching to the two ÒspinningÓ forms, represent the whirring machines that gave this former manufacturing district its character. The form at right is bursting through the frame, symbolizing the future of the neighborhood which is evolving rapidly into a sophisticated urban community. To the artist, the lines escaping the frame are ÒoffshootsÓ representing the future of the subway. This future will include Wifi as well as new stations that will literally take us in new directions.

Although the background may seem abstract, historical references were included that riders may decipher as they pass by. Handholds, rivets, ironwork, and the No. 7 lines extracted from the subway map have all become the visual elements in the work. Although the actual references to these forms may be concealed, a frequent rider will unravel these visual puzzles. Hunters Point Avenue Project is an imaginary machine honoring an industrial past and fueled by Hunters PointÕs promising future.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/hunters-point-avenue-project
NYCT,Bay Pkwy,D,Xin Song,Tree of Life,2012,Laminated glass,"Located in the mezzanine window at the Bay Parkway Station, Tree of Life bridges the art of contemporary photo collage and traditional Chinese paper cut to evoke the community that surrounds the Bay Parkway Station, in a masterwork of precision and grace.

Xin Song began by photographing the busy street scene below the elevated station. Using traditional paper cutting techniques, she transformed the colorful imagery from her photos into an intricate pattern, creating a symmetrical and vibrant flowering tree. This unique work is laminated between thick panes of glass, and can be viewed from two sides. From the outside of the window, a black silhouette appears, creating a graphic filigree reminiscent of BrooklynÕs historic iron work. The interior view, which serves as the focal point upon entering the station mezzanine, is a colorful collage of the contemporary life in the neighborhood. For Song, the subway itself, the surrounding neighborhoods and peoplesÕ daily movements, are the threads that connect the diverse community.

The complex interplay of SongÕs cut paper designs with the color, forms and figures meticulously cut out from the photographs offer riders a visual record to continuously rediscover their surroundings. The pattern and techniques in Tree of Life will speak to all, including the many Asian-American families who have transformed the community in recent years.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/tree-of-life
NYCT,Smith-9th Sts,F,Alyson Shotz,Nautical Chartsâ-Gowanus & Red Hook from 1733â-1922; Fathom Points + Compass Bearings,2013,Glass mosaic and laminated glass,"At the Smith-9 Street Station, Alyson Shotz uses the local maritime history of the surrounding Gowanus and Red Hook communities to create a series of windows and large wall mosaic. Shotz has a studio near the station, in Red Hook, and has long been fascinated by the history in the areaÕs cobblestone streets and old factory buildings. The areaÕs maritime history is at a remove from the casual viewer and Shotz brings it to the forefront, first, in the stationÕs mezzanine level, seen by arriving travelers who make their way from the elevated platform to escalators. There are 26 windows etched with silver reflective ink in layers of glass that create a prismatic effect as one passes them. Each features a different historic nautical map of the waters that are in the general direction the viewer is facing. The maps are from the 1700Õs to 1900Õs and show the Red Hook and Gowanus waterfront and the changes evident as time progresses. The contemporary landscape seen through the windows completes the evolution. The type of glass used makes the maps seem to fade in and out, depending on the time of day and the movement of transit riders through the space. Formerly boarded up and the station rehabilitation enabled these windows to be reopened with new frames, making the station, the highest in the NYC Transit system, a place filled with natural light.

At the station entrance on 9th Street, four large transom windows are etched with what appears to be an elegant line drawing, but which is actually a historic plan of a boat hull, built in Brooklyn around 1770. The piece functions both as an abstract drawing and a marker for this ship building activity that once dominated the neighborhood. Mayer of Munich created the windows.

The rear wall of the station building also may seem like an abstract line drawing created in stainless steel against a vivid blue tile mosaic background. As one moves closer, it is revealed as a nautical map, with numbers for depth and letters for directions. The mosaic map was adapted from a 1779 nautical map of NY Harbor as seen from the shoreline of Brooklyn by Mosaika Art & Design fabricators. Shotz brings history to the present, in the contemporary new station building.",https://new.mta.info/arts-and-design/collection/nautical-charts
NYCT,Knickerbocker Av,M,Cal Lane,The Digs,2013,Steel,"At the Knickerbocker Avenue subway station on the M line, artist Cal Lane created The Digs, a series of steel sculptural panels that adorn the elevated station platforms with intricate lace-like pattern in the form of steel shovels.

The shovels are arranged in a pattern that is reminiscent of architectural arch often seen in the stationÕs Bushwick neighborhood. Lane was drawn to the image of the shovel for its contrasting relationship between the functional shape of a utilitarian object and the elegance of a classic arch. Each of the 28 panels was hand carved by Lane with intricate detail that merged two specific architectural ornaments found on surrounding buildings to create a new pattern, one that evokes both the past and the present.

According to Lane, ÒThe imagery on the Knickerbocker panels comes from both a history of the local architecture and a history of my own work practice. I have been working with the shovel image for a while. I appreciate the shovel as a humble, practical object that has an elegant form like a gothic arch. Inverting the spade shape and repeating it made a gothic window tracery creating a kind of sacred space. The shape to me subtly connects class, religion, labor and luxury. The pattern in the shovel shape was taken from the local architecture, patterns that were repeated in the nearby brownstones of Bushwick, Brookllyn.Ó

Cal Lane, a trained welder prior to becoming an artist, transforms industrial objects into improbably delicate contemporary works of sculpture. Using a plasma cutter or an oxy-acetylene torch, she carves intricate decorative patterns into such industrial cast-offs as I-beams, oil drums, wheelbarrows, shovels, and dumpsters. Her work juxtaposes the domestic with the industrial, marrying functional objects often associated with blue-collar and masculine environments with patterns commonly used in textiles, such as lace, veils or tapestry. These utilitarian objects are thus incised with light and air, and transformed from their conventional past to become beautiful objects.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/the-digs
Metro-North,Croton-Harmon,Hudson,Corinne Ulmann,Croton-Harmon Station,2013,"Laminated glass in windows in south overpassMosaic,  vinyl in north overpass","Croton-Harmon Station is a series of site specific artwork created by Corinne Ulmann for Metro-NorthÕs Croton-Harmon Station on the Hudson Line in 2016 and 2013 respectively. Composing of laminated glass (2013), glass mosaic and vinyl (2016), the artwork depicts views of local and emblematic landscapes as they progress through four seasons.

Installed in the windows of the stationÕs South Overpass in 2013, the laminated glass was fabricated by Peters Studios in three layers of hand painted glass. Homes in Croton subtly emerge in the background of the artwork imaginary, providing familiar views. Each window is paired with the window directly across, so that the room is sequenced into bands of seasons as commuters walk across the space. For some, this path may allude to the passage of hours: from the quiet of morning, still full of potential, towards the abundance and productivity of the coming day. Once home, the images in reverse signal a calming down, a hibernation of the evening or weekend ahead.

In 2016, Ulmann expanded same theme for the stationÕs North Overpass. The new artwork is composed of printed vinyl for the windows portraying views of local landscapes, and the floor-to-ceiling glass mosaic depicting the iconic Croton Dam, a distinctive landmark for the station and the city. Fabricated by Miotto Mosaic Art Studios, the mosaic depicts the dam from a downward angle, at the arrested moment when the calmness of the natural river meets the tumultuous movement of the dam and waterfall, creating a sense of movement and the rushing sound through the use of color and optical illusion in the mosaic.

The artwork pays tribute to the Hudson River School painters and their establishment of the romantic landscape of the Hudson Valley. In a contemporary way, Ulmann incorporates one visual technique they practiced: using the nature as a framing element to establish an infinitude of time and space to the view beyond.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/croton-harmon-station
NYCT,Central Av,M,George Bates,Generation Dynamica,2013,stainless steel,"Bushwick residents come to life in George BatesÕ Generation Dynamica at the Central Avenue station. Consisting of 20 stainless steel panels in the stationÕs platform windscreens, the work depicts larger characters encompassing smaller figures in silhouette, referencing the many populations who make the community their home. The scale of figures within figures causes the viewerÕs the eye to keep moving across the panels, but what becomes quickly apparent is that all are connected.

Generation Dynamica seeks to show how communities are in flux and are shaped by the contributions and aspirations of its individual members and their personal histories. Bates includes elements from the areaÕs social history and waves of immigration, from Germany and Central America, and many places in between. The diversity of musical sounds is also represented in the artwork, and is further evidence of the rich cultural traditionsÐnew and emergingÐthat the artist wanted to convey.

The artwork is fabricated in waterjet cut stainless steel by KC Fabrications. Bates spent many years as a resident of the community served by the station. His inventive use of line and form gives personality to the dozens of figures showcased in the artwork. The figures span age groups and demographics, and each are engaged in activity that represents characteristics about their lives. Together they represent a richly dynamic neighborhood which the artwork panels represent in keenly observed detail.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/generation-dynamica

MTA Bus Company,Mother Clara Hale Bus Depot,NA,Shinique Smith,Mother Hale's Garden,2013,"Mosaic/Tile, Laminated glass","Graced with exuberant brush strokes and a vibrant collage, Mother HaleÕs Garden created by Shinique Smith is inspired by the loving and generous nature of Mother Clara Hale who, for more than 50 years, cared for children -- orphaned, sick and from broken homes -- and helped transform their lives. Totaling approximately 6,672 square feet, the monumental artwork is composed of mosaic located on the fa�ade and laminated glass in windows of the new Mother Clara Hale Bus Depot building located on Lenox Avenue between 146th and 147th Street in Central Harlem.

Shinique Smith collected clothing, fabric and other cast-off materials from the community surrounding Hale House and the Mother Clara Hale Bus Depot to incorporate in her original artwork. A childÕs drawing of a bus stop found near Hale House influenced her deeply and became the source of inspiration for the artwork.

ÒThis (childÕs) drawing inspired my palette,Ó Smith said. ÒWe are all connected by childhood dreams and memories threaded through clothing and the things we consume and discard. I have taken these unwanted bits and woven them into a garden in an attempt to embody the spirit of Mother Clara, creating beauty and grace from humble materials.Ó

Smith works in a variety of artistic media, including collage, painting, sculpture, and video. Her work is known for the vast vocabulary of collected objects that alternate with fluid calligraphic lines and movement, suggestive of qualities that resonate on a personal and social scale. The original work of Mother HaleÕs Garden is composed of ten large_scale panels of colorful painted collage and centers on a spiritual motif of mother and child_like figures embracing in an abstracted garden. Smith worked with Mosaika Art & Design to translate the original work into mosaic, using tiles uniquely made for the project to create roughness and texture on the surface, a process similar to a collage. In May 2012, Smith worked with first grade students at PS 242, Young Diplomats Magnet Academy, to draw flowers and incorporated the drawings into the art glass for the north and south windows of the Bus Depot building. The art glass is fabricated by Peters Studios.

In keeping with the new Mother Clara Bus Depot status as a certified green building, Mother HaleÕs Garden was created by weaving discarded materials into a vibrant garden. The result is a monumental work as the artistÕs tribute to Mother Clara Hale as well as to the people in the community.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/mother-hales-garden

The monumental sculpture embraces light and air, creating a distinctive focal point within Lower ManhattanÕs urban fabric.

Suspended within the atrium's conical form, Sky Reflector-Net is composed of 112 tensioned cables, 224 high-strength rods and nearly 10,000 stainless steel components. Attached to the soaring cable-net are 952 perforated optical aluminum panels that distribute year-round daylight and bring the sky down into the lower levels of the Center. The artwork combines beauty and function, reduces energy consumption by 30 percent and powerfully connects the 300,000 daily transit users with a sense of daylight that will be constantly changing.

According to Carpenter, ÒThe artwork merges the human and social activity of the Fulton Center with a transcendent experience of New York CityÕs extraordinary skies, subtly connecting daily transit usersÕ passage through the cityÕs subterranean network with the daily and seasonal rhythms of the sky.Ó

Visible from the corner of Broadway and Fulton Street, Sky Reflector-Net acts as a primary defining element for the Fulton Center Ðthe powerful influence of natural light on our concept of the time of day, on the changes in the seasons, and the passing of years.

Metro-North,Mamaroneck,New Haven,Kim Cridler,Where the Sweet Waters Fall,2014,"Steel, aluminum and concrete","Where the Sweet Waters Fall is inspired by Romanesque Revival arches seen throughout the architecture of the village of Mamaroneck including its many arched bridges. The artwork title pays homage to the name of the village since itÕs a partial translation of the Native American word Mamaroneck meaning, ÒWhere the sweet waters fall into the sea.Ó With its slender trunks and foliated canopy of a grove of trees, the sculptural arch balances architectural form and narrative content, providing a new focal point and meeting place at a corner of the station that overlooks a busy roadway and a tree-filled park.

Artist Kim Cridler selected trees to reference life, refuge, and history. The arch speaks to the built order of humankind and alludes to strength and support. To engage visitors, Kim incorporated a stylized stream made out of stainless steel starting at the parking lot and leading to a plaza around the sculpture. The stream ends at the bottom of the stairs guiding commuters to the platform. Referencing the name of the village, this river leads through the arch, revealing a group of blue Tree Swallows hidden within the canopy along with the phrase ""where the sweet waters fall into the sea.""

Metro-North,Pelham,New Haven,Loren Eiferman,HOME: INSIDE/OUTSIDE,2014,Steel,"Home: Inside/Outside is inspired by the town of Pelham's early development by Benjamin Fairchild and Benjamin Corlies in 1896. Influenced by the historical time period, artist Loren Eiferman explored the idyllic concept of home, illustrating that home is anywhere and everywhere, including wherever you travel -- even if its a commute into Grand Central. The idealized notion of home is represented by period carpet-inspired designs in sectioned panels that are incorporated into the stations metal railings along the platforms.

Eiferman studied carpet and wallpaper designs of English textile designer William Morris and artisans of the Roycroft movement in her research of Pelham. She chose particular designs, as that would have been found in Pelham Heights homes during the 1890s. By integrating three distinct patterns within the station railings, the artwork creates the appearance of unified carpet segments visible from the station platform. Eiferman layered three separate yet intersecting decorated screens, fabricated in textured black painted steel, resembling painted woodEifermans usual medium of choice. Each carpet seamlessly incorporates the vertical lines of the already installed MTA standard railings, allowing the artwork to be visually read as planks of a wooden floor across the platform. On top of the railings, the viewer can recognize the 'carpets' interspersed throughout the station as if they were the carpets found inside a Pelham home.

Eiferman explains she ""...would like the viewers eyes to linger on these carpet sculptures and find new shapes within the negative spaces I want these carpets to be visually contemplative -- like a modern day mandala in metal. These carpets can engage the viewer into seeing new forms and in that moment of engagement the viewer goes back home, is connected to the outside from the inside-is entertained-is elevated-is engaged in a new way, allowing them to meditate on the value of ""home"" and the ability to take that concept everywhere they may travel.""

Bringing comfort and various association to people, flowers have many meanings and uses. Arredondo uses lilies and crocuses to reflect renewal, hope and awaking, while marigolds, morning glories and daisies are associated with remembrances, commemorations and fiestas. Pansies and morning glories suggest warm weather. Blue, purple and pink roses are full of magic and celebration. The artist seeks to bring color and joy through the expressive artwork to the active urban context of the Bronx station.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/garden-of-earthly-delights
LIRR,Wyandanch Parking Garage,Ronkonkoma,Moe Brooker,Just Jazz,2015,Laminated Glass,"Just Jazz is an unusual project for MTA Arts & Design, in that the project developed by LIRR, to provide parking for commuters and the Wyandanch Rising development, offered the opportunity for a large-scale exterior installation that will be a landmark for the community.

Twenty-eight glass panels were hand painted with bold color, expressive brush strokes and a vibrancy that is an exciting counterpoint to the new parking structure and towerðs geometric order. The glass faces the site of a (planned) community green space.

Artist Moe Brookerðs painted glass work is monumental at five stories high, yet is an inviting and welcoming beacon particularly when illuminated from within at night. The artwork reflects the jazz inspired rhythms and movement that Brooker cites as influencing his free flowing work. Jazz is part of the communityðs history as well, with musicians making their homes here, including John Coltrane, in nearby Dix Hills. Brookerðs abstract work installed at the new building has passages that evoke exuberance as well as reflection. The glass artwork was interpreted from an oil pastel drawing by Mayer of Munich, who closely collaborated with Brooker. The artist has never witnessed his work at the scale it is here, and was profoundly moved by the experience. It is a fitting work to be located near the future planned home of the Long Island Hall of Fame at the Wyandanch Rising development, which is being built in conjunction with the parking facility and a new station coming soon to the community.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/just-jazz
LIRR,Massapequa,Babylon,Peter Drake,Waiting for Toydot,2015,Laminated glass and mosaic,"Artist Peter Drake's father was a model train enthusiast who built villages for his HO and Lionel trains. He also maintained a collection of painted lead toy figures for his train sets, from the 1930s era in which the Massapequa station was originally constructed. Using the toys as inspiration, Drake created paintings of the figures in various poses waiting for their trains. The paintings were interpreted into a series of 17 laminated hand-painted glass windows by Peters Glass for the station's new waiting room windows and the glass above some of the stairways. These windows depict travelers engaged in private moments. The luminous colors are made through multiple layers of transparent pigment that give the artwork a glowing appearance.  

Two mosaic panels show the conductor and his trusty dog, overlooking the stairways. The largest artworks are reserved for two exterior brick walls on the platform, with detailed, hand glazed mosaics in relief for dimension. At 6 by 10 feet each, these works face north and south and also show scenes at Drake's mythic station.  

The mosaics, created by Mosaika Art & Design are expressive and the innovative method of fabrication contributed a magical three-dimensionality. The south-facing mosaic can be seen from nearby Sunrise Highway. The warmly colored and richly detailed works evoke the adventure of travel and family, which refers to the artist's childhood LIRR memories of waiting for his father to return from the city each workday. A Bremen aircraft is shown flying above and refers to the former Fitzmaurice Flying Field at Massapequa Park, one town over. With all of its combined elements ""Waiting for Toydot"" provides a visual identity and deeply felt sense of place to the station.

NYCT,Castle Hill Av,6,Priscila De Carvalho,"Bronx: Heart, Homeland",2015,Stainless steel,"Based on the concept of past to present, encompassing the interplay of place, home, culture and identity, Bronx: Heart, Homeland depicts silhouetted images of people living in the urban neighborhood of the Bronx. The eight black stainless steel units, uniquely integrated within the station environment to create a narrative associated with everyday life in the neighborhood--a life, for most, that revolves around the subway station. The focal points of connections are linked between the home and the heart, both literally and metaphorically. Each silhouetted representation is displayed in different positions: skateboarding, selling books, walking on the street and taking pathways to the station. Man-made fragments of the 20th and 21st century of Bronx history are shown, such as the subway line, networks, electricity cables, telephone poles and other elements. The sculptures are imbued with visible presence not only for those who built them, but for those here today, tomorrow and beyond.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/bronx-heart-homeland
NYCT,Rockaway Blvd,A,Ray King,Connections,2015,Stainless steel and glass,"Connections consists of a series of four portals (each portal has three panels) created with stainless steel and colored glass screens that use light, color, shadow and texture to animate the platform and roadway below the elevated NYC Transit Rockaway Boulevard station. Connections has hundreds of laminated colored glass discs encased in bezels that animate and enliven the experience of MTA passengers passing through the station. The size and density of the glass elements are gradated horizontally to simulate the movement of the trains.

The artistÕs intent was to create a unique place within the neighborhood station, through the color and pattern of the work and its interactive nature, which invites travelers to look through the colored bezels or to follow the shadows they create. The composition and placement of the individual elements speak to the diversity of the surrounding multi-cultural community by emphasizing the interconnectedness of people, places, information technology and the famed A-train subway line that connects Harlem, midtown Manhattan, the Village, Brooklyn, Queens, JFK Airport and Rockaway Beaches. Waiting for the train can now include viewing the surrounding neighborhood via a filter of color and light.

The stainless steel frames were sandblasted and electro-polished to enhance the strength and specular brilliance of the stainless steel. Positioned over the roadway, the screens are visible from inside the station, on the train and outside of the station from a distance, serving as a landmark that celebrates the stationÕs featured role in the neighborhood.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/connections
Metro-North,North White Plains Parking Garage,Harlem,SITU Studio,Percolate,2015,Stainless Steel,"Featuring various forms of vaporizing droplets to reference the role water has played in the history of White Plains, Percolate is a site-specific artwork integrated with the architecture of the parking garage at MNRÕs North White Plains Station.

Commissioned by Arts & Design, the artwork is created by SITU Studio, a team of artists and designers known for its architectural design and research practice. The artwork references the visual theme of water to bring attention to the role water has played in the history of White Plains, going back to the Òheavy mistÓ that gave the town its name. For the artist team, the nearby Bronx River, the Kensico reservoir, the city of White Plains, and the new parking structure all act as different types of vessels, holding and channeling forms of flows toward New York City. Just as the town and the parking structure funnel thousands of passengers through the commuter rail in the MTA system, so too does the reservoir channel hundreds of millions of gallons of water to NYC every day.

Fabricated by SITU and Kammetal, these droplets were laser cut into perforated sculptural screens in cellular-like forms. Approx. 125 stainless steel screens in ever-changing formation of water bubbles clad the metal mesh on the fa�ade of the building, creating a visual perception of upward motion from which these bubbles appear to be gradually vaporized into the air from the upper level of the building. The sculpture entails a very different visual effect whether the viewer is up close observing the fine grains of the finished metal screens, or captivated by the bubbling and shimmering effect from a distance, at a moment when the sun interacts with the surface of these sculptural screens.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/percolate
NYCT,Buhre Av,6,Soonae Tark,Have a Happy Day,2015,Glass mosaic,"Have a Happy Day consists of six mosaic murals of colorful geometric abstract forms, located on the elevated station platforms. Resonating with the landscape of the neighborhood, the vibrant, whimsical arrangements interact with the bright, open sky and the natural light. The rigid lines and square structures, on the southbound platform, are reflective of the buildings and the journey towards Manhattan, while the curved lines and circular motifs, on the northbound platform, are symbolic of nature and Pelham Bay. Miotto Mosaic Art Studio interpreted her original design into the finished panels. For the project, Soonae Tark chose bright, primary colors as forms of expression, similarly to many cultures of people. Through the contrasting configurations, Soonae seeks to inspire commuters and the people of the neighborhood with positive energy and uplifting feelings. The work, with a universal appeal, was designed for all who travel the subway and use this station.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/have-a-happy-day
NYCT,34 St-Hudson Yards,7,Xenobia Bailey,Funktional Vibrations,2015,Mosaic,"BaileyÕs artwork consists of majestic mosaics suspended above the main entrance of the new 34 St Ð Hudson Yards station that provide a celebratory welcome. The art crowns the station and features overlapping mandala-like circles and patterns against a cobalt blue background. In the upper right a sun-like form emits rays of color bands. Starbursts of bright light appear through the blue background. The glass mosaic artwork is vibrant, joyous and rich with pattern and texture and among the largest in Arts & DesignÕs collection of commissioned works in the MTA transit network.

Inside the station mezzanine, the curved recessed ceiling dome contains glittering mosaics, also set against a deep blue background with repeating mandalas and patterns. Xenobia Bailey is a fiber artist who works primarily in crochet and textiles, creating sculptural work and textiles with an architectural harmony that celebrates her materials and forms. Her art for the station began as crocheted pieces, which were transferred to digital images, enlarged and interpreted into mosaic by Miotto Mosaic Art Studio.

Bailey sees the work as speaking to the universal idea of creation and has created artwork that vibrates with energy. She refers to her accumulation of materials as in the tradition of African-American artÑreflected in the music of the 60Õs she grew up withÑand its material culture and design, where one made do with what was available, and made it into something new and wonderful.

NYCT,Ditmas Av,F,Cara Lynch,Inheritance: In Memory of American Glass,2016,Laminated glass,"Created by New York-based artist Cara Lynch, Inheritance: In Memory of American Glass celebrates the vast diversity of people and cultures in the Kensington neighborhood of Brooklyn.

Lynch was inspired by the decorative elements in household glassware that was mass-produced and widely available during the late 19th and first half of the 20th centuries, the same period when Brooklyn neighborhoods were developing rapidly and subway stations were being built. Sourcing decorative patterns commonly seen in American pressed glass, milk glass, cut glass, Depression glass, and carnival glass, Lynch transformed these elements into kaleidoscopic abstractions for the platform windscreens. Fabricated by Peters Glass, the resulting work in six sets of bold and vibrant compositions represents the people of the community, as well as the promising lifestyle desired by those who settled in the neighborhood the station serves.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/inheritance-in-memory-of-american-glass
Metro-North,Croton-Harmon,Hudson,Corinne Ulmann,Croton-Harmon Station,2016,"Glass mosaic, vinyl","""Croton-Harmon Station"" is a series of site specific artwork created by Corinne Ulmann for Metro-NorthÕs Croton-Harmon Station on the Hudson Line in 2016 and 2013, respectively. Composing of laminated glass (2013), glass mosaic and vinyl (2016), the artwork depicts views of local and emblematic landscapes as they progress through four seasons. 

Installed in the windows of the stationÕs South Overpass in 2013, the laminated glass was fabricated by Glasmalerei Peters Studios in three layers of hand painted glass. Homes in Croton subtly emerge in the background of the artwork imaginary, providing familiar views. Each window is paired with the window directly across, so that the room is sequenced into bands of seasons as commuters walk across the space. For some, this path may allude to the passage of hours: from the quiet of morning, still full of potential, towards the abundance and productivity of the coming day. Once home, the images in reverse signal a calming down, a hibernation of the evening or weekend ahead.  

In 2016, Ulmann expanded same theme for the stationÕs North Overpass. The new artwork is composed of printed vinyl for the windows portraying views of local landscapes, and the floor-to-ceiling glass mosaic depicting the iconic Croton Dam, a distinctive landmark for the station and the city. Fabricated by Miotto Mosaic Art Studios, the mosaic depicts the dam from a downward angle, at the arrested moment when the calmness of the natural river meets the tumultuous movement of the dam and waterfall, creating a sense of movement and the rushing sound through the use of color and optical illusion in the mosaic. 

The artwork pays tribute to the Hudson River School painters and their establishment of the romantic landscape of the Hudson Valley. In a contemporary way, Ulmann incorporates one visual technique they practiced: using the nature as a framing element to establish an infinitude of time and space to the view beyond.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/croton-harmon-station
Metro-North,Fordham,Harlem,Dan Funderburgh,Eureka,2016,Aluminum,"Eureka is a series of four ""rose windowsÓ greeting passengers on the north-bound platform of Metro-North RailroadÕs Fordham Station in the Bronx. Reminiscent of the circular centerpiece of many Gothic cathedrals, the artwork depicts the plants and trees of the New York Botanical Garden and references the Gothic details found in the surrounding architecture of Fordham University.

Eureka is the artistÕs homage to Edgar Allan PoeÕs 1848 essay of the same title. Written in his cottage in the Bronx, in what he called a prose poem, Poe elaborated on his views about the origins of the universe which seem to anticipate the Big Bang theory which came later. The four rose windows are designed to evoke four botanical ""big bangs."" Succulents, orchids, bonsai, and cactus form and grow ever outward. The plants chosen celebrate the beauty of the terrestrial and reverently pay tribute to the expansive and diverse universe of flora seen at the New York Botanical Garden.

The artwork is fabricated by KC Fabrications. Each of the four windows is composed of two layers of waterjet-cut aluminum in black and gold, recalling the Gothic Revival. Circular frames housing the smaller discs orbiting each large rose window are built into the metal fence. This effect creates a transition from the artwork panels to the rest of the unadorned platform fence. The visual effect is explosive, when seen from a passing on the train or across the platform. Funderburgh references and connects history, architecture and natural beauty in an inventive and imaginative work of public art that transforms the station.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/eureka
NYCT,111 St,A,Linda Ganjian,Home Sweet Home,2016,Etched stainless steel,"While standing on the station platform, looking up from the street or gazing from a moving subway car, travelers and commuters can see twenty-four sparkling and detailed, water-jet cut, etched stainless steel artwork panels. Inspired by the buildings and homes of the Ozone Park/South Richmond Hill neighborhoods, Linda Ganjian created the detailed designs of Home Sweet Home, taking the visual vocabulary of lace and applying it to the architecture found in the area. From the rows of identical-seeming houses, the artist studied the forms, patterns, and textures that make each house unique. She captures with embroidery-like precision the diagonally-oriented aluminum siding, baroque ironwork on fences, zig-zag tiles, elephant garden statues and more. These often-seen, but overlooked decorative details are not entirely unique to this neighborhood but form the notion of home in our subconscious, defining the way we experience the city and place. Home Sweet Home honors the builders and craftsmen behind the urban architecture as much as the residents who enliven and take pride in it.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/home-sweet-home
NYCT,80 St,A,Mia Pearlman,SOAR,2016,Stainless steel,"A total of 18 gleaming three-dimensional sculptural steel panels transform the 80th St. station platforms. Six panels are double framed with double layers of unique, swirling waves. In the sunlight, they reflect and project patterns of spinning motion onto the pathway of commuters which invites interaction and adds a playful spirit to the commute. The panels are functional as well, protecting the passengers from wind and weather. For her artwork Soar, Mia Pearlman created delicate, miniature papercut sculptures that were transformed through fabrication of hefty plates of steel into the final magical art forms. In creating her design, Pearlman was inspired by standing on the elevated platform and the feeling of closeness to the sky. While waiting for the train, she felt that one is encouraged to contemplate the weather, clouds and colors, all constantly shifting by the moment. The curving, perforated metal panels echo the air currents and the sky above, connecting us to place and reminding us of the beauty inherent in these natural phenomena.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/soar

Created by Brooklyn-based Derek Lerner and fabricated by Depp Glass, the artwork plays with the idea of macro and micro scale, an essential visual language in the artistÕs practice. Each unique drawing takes reference from the geographic location of the station as well as its cartographic relation to the cityÕs transportation network. For example, the path the F train takes through the city and it's many stops, satellite imagery, maps, and other locations specific to the Avenue X station, were the artistÕs starting points.

These photographs have been recreated in mosaic and installed throughout the mezzanine and entrance areas, populating the station with colorful New Yorkers of all stripes. With the generous expanse of the mezzanine concourse, the figures humanize the space and provide bursts of color and visual interest, providing an opportunity for playful discovery while moving through the station. The main station entrance features a laminated glass canopy at street level depicting a flock of birds, bringing art and nature to the busy street.

Vik Muniz is a Brazilian-born artist based in New York City and Rio de Janeiro who uses unconventional materials and methods to create images culled from pop culture and art history. His work appears in international museum collections such as the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

Metro-North,Harlem-125 St,City Terminal Zone,Alison Saar,copacetic,2018,Laminated glass,"In 1991, Alison Saar created ""Hear the Lone Whistle Moan,"" a series of bronze relief sculptures on the north and south platforms of the station. The title refers to a spiritual that uses the train as a metaphor for the passage to heaven. Trains have often been associated by African Americans with escape, and the Underground Railroad in particular.  

In SaarÕs words, Òthese pieces É create a simple narrative of two people. One, the young woman coming to the city in hopes of advancing her career; the other, a successful businessman leaving the city to return to his hometown. I believe these two scenarios to be examples of how many Americans have used the railroads to and from New York throughout history. Yet I was also addressing the specific and rich tradition of the role of the railroad in general in the lives of African Americans.Ó A third figurative sculpture of a train conductor is located at the top of the platform stairs. 

In 2018, as part of station improvement, Saar expanded her original project and created ""copacetic,"" a panoramic scene of imagined dancers, singers, musicians, and patrons enjoying HarlemÕs heyday of the 1930s and Õ40s. ""copacetic"" comprises 24 laminated glass panels installed throughout the four glass shelters along the platforms. The upper windows are inspired by the Harlem-125 Street stationÕs wrought iron work and designs from the African diaspora.  

The glass artwork was created from the artistÕs original woodcut prints, which as she explains, Ògives a nod to the work of the many great African American artists of the Harlem Renaissance that have used the same medium [woodcut prints] in their practice, such as Elizabeth Catlett, Hale Woodruff, and Aaron Douglas.Ó SaarÕs palette of deep reds, blues, and yellows introduces a vibrant graphic quality to the platformÕs shelters, illuminated by the rising and setting sun over Harlem.

The six unique, painted compositions emphasize motion and the blending of color in her grand and vibrant gestural abstraction. Referencing colors found throughout the neighborhood surrounding the Avenue U station, BelagÕs palette and painted marks aim to mirror the diversity of New Yorkers in transit, as well as the movement of the human body in space. The boldness of the brushstrokes and color in the work is in counterpoint to the industrial station design, providing an energetic burst of creative expression.

CHORUS, 2018
Marble mosaic

Artist Ann Hamilton has created CHORUS, an expansive field of text-based artwork in marble mosaic as part of the construction of the new WTC Cortlandt station, which is located below street level within the World Trade Center site.

The artwork features a woven field of text taken from the U.S. Declaration of Independence and the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which conveys a universal language and a timeless artistic excellence, bringing a calming quality to a charged place. This concordance of Rights and Declarations creates an immersive environment to be experienced by riders as they pass along the stationÕs platform walls.

CHORUS spans a total of 4,350 square feet and is integrated into the architectural design of the WTC Cortlandt station and the World Trade Center PATH transit hub to which it is connected. The artwork was created as the result of close collaboration between Ann Hamilton, typographic designer Hans Cogne, and skilled mosaic artisans at Mayer of Munich. Set in monochromatic marble mosaic, the woven text forms a white-on-white tactile surface framing the subway platforms and the movement of citizens throughout the site. The tactile surface invites subway riders to touch the text as they read the words, creating meaningful personal encounters meant to acknowledge the civic ideals and aspirations that form the foundation for the quality of life above.

Ann Hamilton is internationally recognized for her large-scale mixed-media installations. Noted for a dense accumulation of materials, her ephemeral environments create immersive experiences that poetically respond to the architectural presence and social history of their sites. Hamilton is a MacArthur and a Guggenheim fellow. She won the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture, and represented the United States in the 1991 Sao Paulo Bienal, and the 1999 Venice Biennale. In 2015, Hamilton was honored with The National Medal of Arts, the highest award given to artists by the US government.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/chorus
LIRR,Brentwood,Ronkonkoma,Armando Mari–o,The Guardian Angel,2018,Laminated glass,"Armando Mari–oÕs artwork The Guardian Angel is inspired by the historic development of Brentwood and its present as a community. Fabricated by Tom Patti Design, the glass captures the artistÕs original watercolor vibrancy and delicate brushstrokes. Featuring richly colored flowers from the country of origin of many of BrentwoodÕs residents, such as Mexican Dahlias, Peruvian qantu, and Salvadorean Flor de Izote, as well as native flowers of Long Island, a guardian owl representing BrentwoodÕs idyllic past protects the garden. It is a metaphor for cultures integrating harmoniously, rendered in bright, alluring colors and brushwork as an invitation by the artist to Òdiscover the beauty of life that needs to be preservedÉ [flowers] always come back after a hard winter like a reminder that there is always hope for a better future.Ó

In his research at the Brentwood Historical society, Mari–o discovered ÒThe Legend of the Red OwlÓ by Charles A. Codman, written around the same time as the founding of the Brentwood as ÒModern TimesÓ, a utopian community. The allegory is about past and present co-existing peacefully, in which an owl becomes the narratorÕs guardian angel. Mari–oÕs artwork is an update of this tale, with the owl as a modern guardian to inspire and protect the community.

Armando Mari–o is a Cuban artist based in Upstate NY. His paintings are characterized by luminous colors balanced with dark shadows, depicting common scenes with a surreal twist. Moving from one city and landscape to another among Cuba, the Netherlands, France, and Upstate NY has influenced his artistic focus.

Imagery in the artwork includes houses atop stilts and wheels, ladders, the North Star, footprints, recurring circular patterns (both complete and incomplete), and African symbols of spiritual centering.

Ocean waves cover three walls of the station house, featuring ocean buoys and flotsam of Lenape pottery shards and beads, and a flow of North Atlantic sea life in an imitation Delft pottery style. In addition to original patterns inspired by traditional ceramics, certain tiles also feature local icons such as the Jones Beach water tower, historic Bellmore station, and the nearby marinas.

In addition to the mosaic ocean waves, Miotto Mosaic Art Studio fabricated Funderburgh's elaborate design emulating hand painted glaze by digitally printing on ceramic tile and waterjet cutting the forms of native fish and crustaceans. These techniques are a marriage of traditional aesthetics and craft with modern technology and materials.

Port Jefferson has a long history as a ship building center and a strong connection to its past. Located more than 2 hours east of Manhattan, the station serves as a gateway to the historic village that lies to its north. David McQueen's stainless steel sculpture at the LIRR Port Jefferson station is comprised of three ships once built in Port Jefferson (a schooner, a yawl, and a sloop), and he wanted them to ""sail through its consciousness"". Each is positioned to curve as if sailing through the sea, and held aloft by 52 boat stands. The ships are modified re-creations of those built here during the mid-1800's at the Bayles and Darling Shipyards.

The title of the sculpture is taken from the French aviator and author Antoine de Saint-ExupŽry's writings in a passage about instilling a love of the sea, ""If you wish to build a ship, do not divide the men into teams and send them to the forest to cut wood. Instead, teach them to long for the vast and endless sea."" The ships are presented as if they are in the process of being built, temporarily aground, but bound for the ocean. They are connected to the past, but look to the future, full with potential.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/vast-endless-sea

Glass and ceramic mosaic artwork by Derek Fordjour appears throughout the historic 145th St-Lenox Av station, and celebrates the African-American parade tradition in Harlem and its pageantry. Miotto Mosaic Art Studios translated FordjourÕs layered surfaces into glass and ceramic mosaic, capturing the collage process inherent in his work. Based on his richly textured paintings created with humble materials such as newspaper, oil pastels, and charcoal, lines of drum majors, majorettes, dancers, and drummers joyfully parade along the platforms, and are accompanied by crowds of people and flags.

From his historic research into the neighborhood, the artist touches on the legacy of parades through Harlem starting with the Harlem Hellfighters 369th Regiment in 1919 after WWI, through to the African American Day Parade founded during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s and continuing today. FordjourÕs artwork provides riders with a chance to encounter a celebration of community, history, and identity in the colorful art that complements the stationÕs improvements and reinforces the historic fabric of the station.

Derek Fordjour is a Harlem-based artist of African-American heritage. In his richly textured paintings, the artist draws upon a variety of sources including sporting imagery, board games, and carnival motifs to explore ideas of vulnerability, aspiration, and structures of fairness. He has recently held residencies at the Sugar Hill Museum and the Sharpe-Walentas Studio Program, and was awarded the 2018 Deutsche Bank NYFA Fellowship Award.

Glass mosaic

The glass mosaic artworks installed at 34th Street-Penn Station on the 7 Av Line are meditations on the unique history of Penn Station and a reflection of its transient atmosphere as one of New York CityÕs immense transportation hubs. Resurrected in shimmering glass mosaic of pearls, aquas, and gold, the works are both historic and contemporary, static and fluid, figural and architectural. In The Arc of Gradiva on the sixty-foot long south wall, an image of Gradiva, the mythological female character from Wilhelm JensenÕs novella who Òwalks through wallsÓ and roams the ancient ruins of Pompeii, appears as a ghostly apparition, with the flowing fabric of her garment stretching the length of the wall. Her footsteps mirror those of the crowds in the station. The Arches of Old Penn Station on the west wall holds a painterly image of the original 1910 Beaux-Arts Penn Station grand interior, dripping and obscured, suggestive of an image slipping off the surface, but also tied and held to the grid of the surrounding tilework. Both images originate from life-size line drawings on mylar. The gestural lines create ghosted images of the past, coming in and out of focus through the stationÕs walls. When considered together, one might imagine that Gradiva has come to claim both the original Penn Station in its former glory, as well as stake her presence in the newly improved subway station.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/arches-of-old-penn-station

Areas surrounding Richmond Valley station are interlaced with beautiful ponds, streams and wetlands. They are the inspiration for EveretÕs artwork, A Portrayal of Life at Mill Creek. Everet created a series of stainless steel artwork panels that represent species of wildlife supported in local habitats.

The artist presents varying combinations of animal, insect and plant species within each panel design. The Common Snapping Turtle, known to nest in the area, is paired with the Indian Tobacco Plant which is named for the tobacco-like scent of its small ornate flowers. The naturalized Climbing Nightshade Vine, with its dangling star-like flowers and red berries is coupled with the Appalachian Brook Crayfish, whose chimney like openings occasionally protrude from a network of tunnels along the banks of the creek. The Calico Pennant Dragonfly, endowed by nature with red heart-shaped spots is complemented with tall colonies of Common Cattail, that are known for their dense cylindrical flowers. The Yellow Trout Lily, which appears briefly in spring, is combined with the Morning Cicada, which is named for its singing from morning to midday.

Many of the plants and animals in the local ecosystem have nurtured each other and served as a source of food and medicine for humans.

The artwork, which replaces standard picket fencing on the 14th Avenue bridge parapets, is an invented map of Mount Vernon, based on the grid structure of city land plots and overlaid with personal mapping that imagines a personÕs daily route through the city. The artist reflects on movement, exploration, and personal routes of the cityÕs residents and visitors, from different vantage points over time.

NYCT,36 Av,"N,W",Maureen McQuillan,Crystal Blue Persuasion,2018,Laminated Glass,"Laminated glass artwork by Maureen McQuillan for the 36 Ave station features vibrantly hued and mysteriously suspended forms. Fabricated in laminated glass by Queens-based glass studio Depp Glass, McQuillanÕs artwork references both the diverse social fabric of Astoria and the daily commutes of riders within the 36 Av station.

After the music composition by Tommy James, the artwork is titled Crystal Blue Persuasion, and is located in mezzanine windows of the station. The simple forms, such as stripes and diamonds, become dynamic patterns when repeated, suggesting everything from ancient textiles, tapestry to fractals and microscope photography.

Maureen McQuillan makes abstract, geometric forms and patterns in her paintings and drawings. She applies ink lines in layers of acrylic polymer with museum board which are subsequently manipulated to fold and bend in undulating ripples.

Glass mosaic

Glass mosaic murals by artist Nancy Blum grace the platform walls of the historic 28 St station. The artwork celebrates the station and the above-ground neighborhood that includes architectural gems such as the New York Life Building and Madison Square Park, which are just a few blocks away. The station artwork depicts seven flowering plants that are sourced from the Madison Square Park ConservancyÕs Perennial Collection. The flowers include Red Buds, Magnolias, Hellebores, Witch Hazel, Daffodils, Hydrangea and Camellia. The blooming plants were chosen as representation of plant species that withstand changing climate conditions of the city.

Similar to an everchanging garden, ROAMING UNDERFOOT creates a delightful place to enjoy during every season. BlumÕs intent was to capture some of the magic of the nearby park, regarded as an urban sanctuary, and to enhance the station environment for transit riders.

Glass mosaic

Artist Rico Gatson created a series of eight portraits entitled, Beacons, for the 167 St station. The portraits feature renowned figures of history and culture, sourced from photographs and translated into glass mosaic. Beacons is a celebration of the energy and spirit of individuals who have been influential within the Bronx community and have received positive acclaim for their cultural, political and artistic contributions.

The eight figures highlighted in GatsonÕs artwork include Gil Scott-Heron, Tito Puente, Celia Cruz, Audre Lorde, James Baldwin, Maya Angelou, Reggie Jackson and Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Gatson juxtaposes the black and white portraits with hard-edge geometric lines using a palette of red, orange, yellow, black, grey, and green, which act as a metaphor for beaming light.

The portraits radiate with beauty and pride of these influential figures, and invite travelers to reflect on the past as well as find inspiration for the future. The stationÕs mosaic murals are an extension of GatsonÕs earlier ÒIconsÓ series, showing new ways to present biography and photography in a contemporary, bold and graphic way. GatsonÕs artwork reveals a mix of influences -- performance, conceptualism, minimalism and constructivism, to name a few-- which are combined with an interest in history and representation.

LIRR,Hicksville,Port Jefferson,Roy Nicholson,"Hempstead Plain, Morning & Evening",2018,Laminated glass,"Roy Nicholson created glass mosaic artwork for the Hicksville station in 2002, and when the station underwent a major platform rehabilitation in 2018, he was invited to expand the project to the new waiting rooms on the rebuilt platform above.  

In the ""Morning Transit, Hempstead Plain"" and ""Evening Transit, Hempstead Plain"" mosaic murals, Nicholson takes viewers back in time. The area around Hicksville was once a notable rarity, an example of an original prairie landscape most often associated with the Midwest. Nicholson recaptures that setting, in look and spirit, as if seen from a speeding train. The colors vary according to the time of day depicted Ñ soft green and blue hues for sunrise in ""Morning Transit,"" and red and blue hues for sunset in ""Evening Transit.""

""Each commuter imagines his or her own personal scenery,"" says Nicholson. ""One can look at it over and over again and discover new images."" The artist creates a contemplative meditation on landscape and rewards the viewer with an affectionate look back at Long Island before the post-war housing boom forever altered the landscape.  

In the newer installation, ""Hempstead Plain, Morning & Evening,"" Nicholson's 72 laminated glass panels bathe four platform waiting rooms with vibrant light and color. Additional glass panels frame two stair enclosures, and two mosaics above the stairs at the platform's west end continue the motif, making Hicksville station an engaging and lively environment.

Expanding on the artist's earlier vibrant mosaic landscapes in the station building, these sprawling transparent vistas are inspired by the historic writings of naturalist Henry Hicks, whose grandfather, Isaac Hicks, developed the first plant nursery in the area. 

Nicholson's painted glass panels, fabricated by Glasmalerei Peters Studios, capture the feeling and excitement of a train swiftly rushing through the open Hempstead Plain. The palette evokes the different times of day a commuter would pass through, with the soft blues and greens of the morning and the glowing yellows and oranges of the evening. As a longtime Long Island resident, the artist chose to name each of the 50-foot waiting rooms after a tree representative of early 20th century writings on the bucolic area: oak, sumac, cedar, and maple are the name signs framed by smaller paintings that represent these species. ""I wanted to connect today's commuters with the landscape they are passing through and to echo the historic prairie with its indigenous plants, sweeping vistas and colorful morning and evening light,"" he says.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/hempstead-plain-morning-evening

The artwork is inspired by SecordÕs own walking meditations in nature  taken  throughout the year. The piece, ""Bronx Seasons Everchanging,"" captures the color atmospheres of annual cycles of spring, summer, fall, and winter, as well as their transitions. 

Fabricated in glass mosaic and glazed tile by Miotto Mosaic Art Studios, the piece uses the language of geometry and color block pixilation to express rich interplays of pigment and to display formal elements of design. The combination of these components creates a vibrantly spirited, yet calming impact on the viewer.

NYCT,Avenue U,N,Sally Gil,Edges of a South Brooklyn Sky,2018,Glass mosaic,"At the Avenue U station, on the Sea Beach line, Brooklyn-based artist Sally Gil created a series of fourteen mosaics entitled Edges of a South Brooklyn Sky. Reflecting on the Gravesend neighborhood where the Avenue U station is located, Gil used her poetic style to re-interpret and re-situate recognizable places and objects found throughout the area. Each of the fourteen mosaic panels whimsically represents Gravesend, and the diverse communities living there past and present. 

There are seven mosaics on each of the stationÕs platforms, each containing a roving skyline and depicting familiar structures and things, such as Italian rainbow cookies, a quail egg, a Mexican Concha cookie, railroad tracks, and even the station house at the Avenue U subway entrance. Local architectural structures are placed close to the center line of all fourteen mosaics, because, as Gil says, Òthe horizon line is where the business of living happens.Ó Concurrently the myriad objects, representing the rich social texture of the multiethnic Gravesend community, float amidst the day and night skies. This is where, as Gil says, Òthe internal life lives, all the complex and mystifying contemplations that move us.Ó The day and night skies are reversed in form and concept across the platforms, helping to situate daily commuters in time and space, as they leave from and arrive back to the Avenue U station. 

Sally Gil uses painting and mixed media collage to make her artworks. For the Avenue U station, her fourteen, original mixed media pieces were fabricated in glass mosaic by Mosaicos Venezianos de MŽxico. Gil worked closely the mosaicists to replicate her small scale works into the fourteen large scale mosaic murals now permanently located along the platforms. As riders move through the Edges of a South Brooklyn Sky, artist Sally Gil reminds us that, Òevery day we are making our place in the world, and the subway is the conduit that transports us. We live on a physical plane, while dwelling in our thoughts and imaginations -- the world of our own stories. Ultimately I believe, although from differing places, we all want the same things: To live peacefully, with what we need and want"".",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/edges-of-south-brooklyn-sky

Hellion Equilibrium is a vibrant tempered and laminated colored glass project by Sarah Morris. Installed on the elevated platforms of the 39 Av-Dutch Kills station, MorrisÕ project can be seen from both the platform and the street below. Hellion Equilibrium provides an evolving spectrum of color and sharp-edged shapes that invites the viewer to reflect upon the concepts of motion, scale, light, mapping, and social space through the use of organically evolving forms.

Morris, throughout her career, has been fascinated by a wide range of visual references, including GPS technologies, topological mapping, and industrial graphics. Her practice has always been interested in patterns of movement within the city, whether it be production, commuters, pedestrians, vehicles or currency. Most recently, she has incorporated QR codes referencing specific locations into her paintings, visualizing movement and how it is thought to effect human behavior and perception.

Hellion Equilibrium, fabricated by Glassworks, references an abstracted rendering of the 39 Av-Dutch Kills stationÕs GPS location, and features a spectrum of color and shapes that invite commuters to reflect upon various concepts, and most of all, the ideas of motion and municipal movement and travel.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/hellion-equilibrium

Westfall worked closely with Queens-based glass fabricator Depp Glass to create the 47 laminated glass panels installed at the 30 Av station. The scale, mirrored glass, and merging movement invoke not only the repertoire of processional themes in classical friezes, but also the movement of public transportation in our contemporary life, in particular the shuttering of light through the mezzanine windows and the bustle of commuters in our mass transit system.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/perasma-dappleganger
LIRR,Stewart Manor,Hempstead,Timothy Hyunsoo Lee,Come Back Home,2018,Laminated glass,"For the Stewart Manor station, artist Timothy Hyunsoo Lee created a series of 45 laminated glass panels entitled, Come Back Home. Inspired by and derived from a series of original watercolor paintings, Come Back Home responds to the landscape of Stewart Manor and to the community that lives nearby. The works take their inspiration from the flora of Garden City, extracting colors from the leaves as they go through the seasons. Lee used his signature painting style - incorporating fractal-like forms - to reference the seasonal plants found in Garden City. His paintings include the great variety of colors from these plants found throughout the year, with more vibrant greens seen in the spring and a kaleidoscopic array of yellows, reds, and greens and browns in autumn.

Lee worked with glass fabricator Tom Patti Design to translate his paintings into their final form as laminated glass panels. The compositions of the glass panels, located in three shelter sheds on the station's platforms, initially appear as landscapes - possibly manicured gardens - but closer inspection reveals abstractions in color and shapes that echo the timeless cycles of seasons, of lives, and on a smaller and more relevant scale, the daily commute.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/come-back-home

William Low is a painter and illustrator based in Huntington, Long Island. His scene of vibrantly colored dahlias in a pastoral field for Deer Park station creates a contemplative space in the station waiting room. The large scale flowers shift the viewerÕs perspective, providing an experience of childlike wonder at the natural world.

The artwork is derived from the local areaÕs botanic legacy: Central Park was first landscaped with ornamental trees and shrubs that had been grown in Deer Park, and the town was well known for annual dahlia festivals. The area is still a floral site, with several wholesale nurseries near to the station. Deer Park Dahlias acknowledges this specific, but not widely known, aspect of the community.

LowÕs signature style uses classic painting techniques to depict city and nature scenes with shimmering sunlight and evocative color. Drawing from real life observations, his work conveys personal experience as shared memory. He has won numerous awards including four Silver medals from the Society of Illustrators, and has illustrated several beloved childrenÕs books.

William WegmanÕs Stationary Figures features eleven glass mosaic panels of his famed Weimaraner portraits. Photographed with the artistÕs deadpan sense of humor, the dogs take on human attributes, from wearing street clothes like a shiny raincoat or flannel shirt, to being grouped like passengers as they gaze into space or peer down the platform as if waiting for the train. Situated in bold blocks of color, the larger-than-life mosaic dogs are bursting into space and interacting with commuters. The mosaic fabricator, Mayer of Munich, interpreted the photographs taken for this project by meticulously transforming the facial expressions, skin textures and patterns of the dogsÕ vibrant attire into glass mosaic. Wegman has lived and worked in the neighborhood for decades, and together with his dogs Flo and her brother Topper they have created images that enliven this busy station.

Speaking about the project, Wegman said, ÒI wanted to create portraits of individual characters, people who you might see next to you on the platform. For these I dressed the dogs in more or less ordinary clothes, nothing too fashionable. I was very interested in the way in which photographs, even the out of focus dogs in the background of some images, could be translated into mosaic by Mayer of Munich, who skillfully turned grey stones into grey dogs.Ó",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/stationary-figures

The words, Remember, Dream, or Imagine Peace, punctuate the daily commute with a hopeful, reflective spirit. The transformation of photographs into mosaic sky paintings with subtle gradations in color and tone, creates a visually striking station environment.

ÒIÕm thrilled that my new work, SKY, will be opening at the 72 St subway station just steps from my home and Strawberry Fields, which I created in memory of my late husband.

""Nature Wall"" conceptually and aesthetically expands on DezsšÕs nearby metal artwork, ""Nature Rail,"" located along the pedestrian transfer bridge of the adjoining 62nd St station on the D line. Using ""Nature Rail""'s characteristic visual elements Ñ specifically, plants and animals surviving on the urban stage Ñ Dezsš composed a cascading set of mosaic murals, re-contextualizing her unique visual iconography and infusing vibrant color onto the stationÕs platforms. The plant and animal motifs borrowed from ""Nature Rail"" link the two stations by offering visual continuity, while the different medium of mosaic creates a distinct visual identity for the New Utrecht Av station.  

Speaking about her inspiration for this artwork, Dezsš shared that her ""imagination was captured by how wild plants found ways to survive and thrive in this very urban area. From abandoned lots to areas between buildings, nature found ways to grow alongside construction sites, structures of steel and concrete, even in potholes. It made me smile every time I saw an uninvited, un-nurtured plant surviving entirely on its own on the urban stage.""

The laminated glass artwork consists of 85 panels that span the length of the newly rehabilitated platforms and extend onto four new pedestrian bridges that connect the station to Crown Heights and Bedford-Stuyvesant, which are represented in the artwork.

Drawing from aerial photos, maps, and personal history, Adams employs his signature collage-like style to reimagine the community. Fanciful assemblages represent the areaÕs vibrant and diverse population as well as the buildings and structures in which they work, live, play, and travel.

""Around the Way"" emphasizes the symbiotic relationship between neighborhood residents and their built environment. Recognizable street configurations include the train winding through the scene. Trees dot the sidewalks and street corners of this city-scape and, unexpectedly, sprout from the palms of the figures, symbolizing the importance of nature in the city and its cycles of growth, renewal, and sustainability.

Adams reflects, ""As a longtime resident [of the area], I was inspired to create this work as a response to the vibrant cultural surroundings and diverse population which I see in motion on a daily basis. The figures fuse with architecture and nature as a representation of the progressive impact left by generations of growth. These hybrid structures represent the many important components which reside together to form a thriving community."" 

AdamsÕ prominent use of patterning and color-blocking, a technique by which shades opposite one another on the color wheel are paired to create complimentary color schemes, adds visual complexity to the piece.

Ore-Giron visualizes the world as abstract forms and shapes, and envisions the interaction and interplay of these shapes as a reflection of societal dynamics. This exchange between forms and his use of geometries symbolizes the ways in which people of different communities Ñ such as those surrounding the Bay Pkwy station Ñ negotiate their relationships with each other and new places, a process of reinvention and creation.  

The 12 mosaic panels on each platform reference the corresponding journey. As commuters travel southbound towards Coney Island, Ore-GironÕs designs reference the natural world, with fluid arcs and warm colors evoking the feelings one might have when going to the beach. The northbound platform mosaics mimic the movement of gears and the mechanics of the human-made world, conjuring feelings of New YorkÕs ecstatic urban environment.  

""PeopleÕs Instinctive Travels: Homage to the Tribe"" originates from Ore-GironÕs ""certain nostalgia for global modernism,"" wherein ""public works meant to create a kind of civic mindedness and unity.""

They carry multiple interpretations that shift and unfold as travelers pass by from street to subway and back again, embodying a textile Òtree of lifeÓ pattern familiar to many cultures. 

To create her glass artwork, Condon recombined sections from a variety of her paintings into new configurations and compositions. In Urban Idyll, time unfolds in liquid pours of color, undulating gestures, and birds, trees and flowers at various stages of flight, perch and bloom. These elements turn and flow rhythmically across the sequences of the glass artwork, evoking the transitions of travel. The linear, elongated compositions echo musical notations and film frames, dear to AstoriaÕs cinematic history. Placed in East, West, North and South locations in the stationÕs mezzanine, Urban Idyll is designed to be read from right to left, like a scroll, recording the passage of time through vivid color. On the East passageway, the artwork welcomes and references sunrise, as bursts of yellow transition to orange and reds as the day moves on. The South-facing artwork offers respite at high noon when the sun is high and bright, and a flying bird in the West passageway escorts us through a saturated sunset toward evening, and home. Diverse paint applications reveal numerous approaches and viewpoints, echoing in visual form the experience of successive generations of immigrants from around the world who flourish in a culture they co-create, much like that of Astoria, Queens.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/urban-idyll

Food items such as dumplings, egg tarts, kebabs, tacos, churros, borscht, and lasagna are morphed into building facades, store fronts, mailboxes, fruit stands, and subway cars. Imagery captured from the surrounding neighborhood is rendered into simplified, graphic shapes in vibrant hues.  

""Made With Love"" was translated into laminated glass panels by Glasmalerei Peters Studios and can be seen on both platforms of the station. The engaging and joyful work is meant to generate playful and whimsical responses from riders as they discover familiar elements from their cultures and communities.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/made-with-love
LIRR,Syosset,Port Jefferson,Tom Fruin,Sail,2019,Acrylic and Metal,"The LIRR Syosset station in the township of Oyster Bay serves many communities with a strong connection to the Long Island Sound and Oyster Bay. The sculpture created by Tom Fruin celebrates that connection, dating back to the areaÕs founding when shipbuilding was a key local industry.  

At 18 feet tall, the stainless steel and plexiglass sculpture serves as a welcoming gateway at the station, signifying home, recreation, and natural attractions. The colorful sail casts a kaleidoscope of colorful shadows during the daytime sun, and transforms into a beacon of light at night.

In his sculpture and public art, Fruin takes on urban objects such as houses, water towers, and flags, elevating their form and architectural scale to become a focal point and part of the landscape. Here, he creates his first vessel, a sailboat, with its main form as an arced plane that catches light and creates a sense of movement that animates the station entry.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/sail
Metro-North,Crestwood,Harlem,Tricia Wright,"Morning Glory, Evening Splendor; The Perennial Village",2019,Metal & Laminated Glass,"The artwork by Tricia Wright for the Crestwood station is composed of sculptural fence in stainless steel along the ADA ramp on the ground level, and the laminated glass in the windows of the stationÕs overpass above. Altogether, it is a celebration of the perennial rhythms of growth and renewal of village life, as well as the regenerative power of a tight-knit community as generation after generation return to raise a family in their own childhood village. 

The laminated glass artwork, ""Morning Glory, Evening Splendor,"" features silhouetted morning glories against a light, bright morning sky in the east window, and evening primroses glowing in the deep blue of an evening sky in the west. The east/west emphasis acknowledges the daily cycles of the morning commute and evening return, marking it as a physical and symbolic crossroads. 

The sculptural fence, ""The Perennial Village,"" is interspersed with clock faces reinforcing the cyclical rhythms of the station and of the village. Morning glory intertwines along the fence, making a strong visual connection to the east window directly above. Water and lily pad motifs in the fence bring a sense of fluid movement. The shadows cast by the cut-out fence soften the architecture and echo the nature trail that runs alongside the Bronx River on the west side of the station. 

Collaborating with Tom Patti Design on the glass and KC Fabrications on the sculptural fence, Wright commented: ""My intention in designing the artworks at Crestwood Station was to bring a feeling of energy and positivity to the daily experience of commuting, and to parallel the rhythms of village life with the rhythms of the natural world. It was important to me to acknowledge that the station is more than just a start and end point in a daily commute, but a village landmark serving two communities, and I wanted my artwork to resonate with the community at large.""",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/morning-glory-evening-splendor
Metro-North,White Plains,Harlem,Barbara Takenaga,Forte (Quarropas); Blue Rails (White Plains),2020,Mosaic & Laminated glass,"The artwork by Barbara Takenaga for the White Plains station consists of mosaic and laminated glass. Featuring the artistÕs signature stylized abstract forms, the artwork emits deep vibrant blue in movement that references rail travel, the history of the city, and its exuberant energy. 

ÒBlue Rails (White Plains)Ó in laminated glass is located on the side platform overlooking the stationÕs parking lot and Hamilton Avenue. The long horizontal image is composed of a series of mirrored abstract patterns in a forward and backward movement in space. Each composition is anchored by the radiating light from a misty horizon suggesting the white mist and the disappearing tracks as they move away from the station. Animated by shifting light throughout the day, ""Blue Rails (White Plains)"" is a visual play to the ""rhythm of the rails.""

Titled after the old name of White Plains, the mosaic artwork ""Forte (Quarropas)"" features a sweeping composition of dynamic sky with flowing blue water, evoking a celestial aspect and the role water has played throughout the history of White Plains. The work serves as an energized entry into a place of travel and movement. Amid the deep sea of blue, splashes of iridescent green to pink and aqua sparkle and come to live following the footsteps of the commuters passing through the lobby wall. 

As stated by Takenaga, ÒWhite Plains has a rich and diverse past, from its modern history tracing way back to the presence of Native Americans. The translation of the wonderful Wecquaesgeek name 'Quarropas,' meaning 'white marshes' or 'plains of white,' still continues today in a very resonant way. I am interested in the poetry and imagined references to landscape Ñ filtered through my working process which is visually abstract and stylized, and at the same time pays homage to the city of water and white mists.Ó",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/forte-quarropas-blue-rails-white-plains
LIRR,Merillon Avenue,Port Jefferson,Cara Enteles,Commuting Through Nature,2020,Laminated glass,"Cara EntelesÕ ""Commuting Through NatureÓ at the Merillon Avenue station celebrates the bucolic landscape of Garden City and brings nature prominently into the station. The glass windows of the elevator towers show a mix of local wildflowers and foliage that create floral lacework, giving way to a landscape of windswept sky and the bodies of water that enliven and define Long Island. The concept of the artwork is centered on the monarch butterfly, considered by the artist to be Òthe ultimate commuter,Ó which makes a 3,000-mile migration, including a stop in Long Island, every September. 

The butterflies appear alongside flowers and plants familiar to residents of Garden City or visitors to the Garden City Bird Sanctuary. Among them are various types of Milkweed, Asters, Queen AnneÕs Lace, vines, and other local plant life, lovingly selected by Enteles, who is an avid gardener. The exaggerated scale of the floral vistas and butterflies allows those who encounter the artwork to become immersed in the local natural landscape. The images are activated by light that changes over the course of a day, and through the seasons of the year. 

EntelesÕ paintings were translated into the 50 hand-painted, laminated glass panels located throughout the station by fabricator Glasmalerei Peters Studio. A metal decorative fence depicting EntelesÕ kaleidoscopic pattern of butterflies is also installed at the station, via the Nassau Avenue pedestrian bridge.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/commuting-through-nature
LIRR,Carle Place,Port Jefferson,Gail Boyajian,Aviary,2020,Laminated glass,"Gail BoyajianÕs artwork ""Aviary"" explores themes of flight, in part paying homage to the nearby Cradle of Aviation Museum, Grumman headquarters, and airports. ""Aviary"" features various birds native to the Carle Place area of Long Island and its green spaces that support their habitats, as well as some extinct ones like the Passenger Pigeon and the Carolina Parakeet that flourished at the time of early attempts at human flight. 

The artwork is made up of 42 hand-painted, laminated glass panels that were fabricated by Glasmalerei Peters Studio. It features depictions of aircraft made by Grumman, such as the Apollo Command and Service module and the F-14 jet. There are various helicopters and passenger planes, as well as images of historical flying contraptions, including balloons, blimps and bicycle powered kites, indicating humankindÕs wish to emulate the flight of birds throughout time. Frogs and marshland habitats appear in several panels as a nod to the history of the community and its original name, Frog Hollow. The composition, based on BoyajianÕs original hand- painted and digital artwork, is continuous across the elevator towers, with the glow of a sunset and a high moon suggesting the passing of the day through the shifting colors, creating a scene to be experienced from many points of view over time.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/aviary
NYCT,Grand Central-42 St,"S,4,5,6,7",Jackie Ferrara,"Grand Central: Arches, Towers, Pyramids",2020,Ceramic mosaic,"The passageways and waiting areas of Grand Central's subway stations are like a bustling city, an underground community Ñ but without a skyline. This mosaic artwork brings architectural views down below. 

As part of the 2020 upgrades to the 42 St Shuttle, Jackie FerraraÕs ÒGrand Central: Arches, Towers, PyramidsÓ (2000) was expanded to span the new six-car length of track 4 and wrap new stairs from the mezzanine. The project was originally conceived as a skyline for the underground passageways and waiting areas of Grand Central Terminal. Rendered as an expansive mosaic band more than 1,500 feet long, the artwork brings architectural views down below into the busting station. Original artwork and expansion were fabricated by COLORCO Ltd. 

Ferrara has long been interested in the simple and repetitive forms of building, and she uses forms that are simple and schematic, and almost primitive-looking structures. Taken together, they lend a unity and meditative character to the space; as people move through the platforms and passageways, the images seem to shift, and no two vistas are the same. Ferrara thinks of these as pieces of a mathematical puzzle. The spare simplicity and economy of design attracts viewers. Nothing is casual or unintentional in the artist's design, which she describes: ""This sequence of stripe/image is calculated. It can be seen as images on a strip of film, or a line of faces framed in the windows of a passing train.""",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/grand-central-arches-towers-pyramids

NYCT,Astoria Blvd,"N,W",Jeffrey Gibson,I AM A RAINBOW TOO,2020,laminated glass,"""I AM A RAINBOW TOO,"" the laminated glass artwork by artist Jeffrey Gibson at the Astoria Blvd station, honors and reflects the evolving and diverse population of people from countless backgrounds and cultures that make up the communities in Astoria, Queens and New York City overall. The artwork focuses on the ROYGBIV colors of the light spectrum, which has long been used by many communities to reflect diversity, inclusivity, and hope. Through this artwork, Gibson embraces and celebrates innumerable cultures by inserting a spectrum of skin tones into the already recognizable rainbow color scheme. 

""I AM A RAINBOW TOO"" is made up of 102 unique, custom designs made by Gibson and translated into laminated glass by Tom Patti Design. The laminated glass panels are installed throughout the mezzanine and platform levels of the Astoria Blvd station, where they can be seen from both the street and roadways below, and as one enters and moves through the station. Each artwork composition acts as a unique iteration of an expansive version of the rainbow, with elements that abstractly reference the sun, moon, and cosmos.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/i-am-rainbow-too

No two visits will ever be the same.

The expansive work is located near the 42 Street entrance on the landing and mezzanine levels of the stairs and escalator that connect Grand Central Terminal with the subway station. It's composed of over 5,000 pieces of glass in more than 70 different colors. The composition inverts the commuterÕs visual experience of descending underground. The progression begins with an upper landing rendered in sparkling deep blues that reference the celestial ceiling of Grand Central TerminalÕs Main Concourse and contrast the pale stone architecture of the terminal. It then bursts into a kaleidoscope of color on the lower mezzanine, dazzling against the backdrop of black granite in the renovated subway entrance.

Camouflage serves as a representation of nature. The artwork's organic patterning contains a sense of life. Shapes appear fluid and imbue the surface with a swirling visual dynamism that mimics the pulsating energy of the station itself.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/i-dreamed-a-world-and-called-it-love

The artist was inspired by the history of Mount Vernon and its familiar story of changing communities to imagine an artwork that brings together many types of people in a shared experience. Fabricated by KC Fabrications, polished aluminum bars based on the train tracks running below crisscross and create a dynamic visual rhythm. Geometric forms derived from the percussion instruments of various cultures are interspersed in the open space and invite the community to play by hand.

NYCT,86 St,R,Amy Bennett,Heydays,2021,Glass mosaic,"A glass mosaic mural installed within the mezzanine wall of the 86 St station, ""Heydays"" celebrates the past and present of Bay Ridge, which is always evolving. The work is based on paintings by Amy Bennett, whose artwork is based on the unique characteristics of the neighborhood's homes, which offer a glimpse into the past. Captivated by the great estates and summer homes dating to the area's rural origins, the artist re-imagined the neighborhood in her mosaic artwork, building detailed 3-D replicas that served as still-life models for her painstakingly detailed paintings, from which the mosaics were interpreted. Trees, grass and a light blue sky surround the houses and neighbors may be interpreted as from the past or the present.

Metro-North,Port Jervis,Port Jefferson,Armando Veve,Boat House Buggy,2021,Laminated glass,"Inspired by the carefully curated displays of Victorian dollhouse cross sections, ""Boat House Buggy"" by Armando Veve showcases prominent symbols, objects, architectural forms, and industries of Port Jervis. This glass menagerie of natural and mechanical scenes serves as a vibrant entrance and point of inspiration for visitors and the community.

The artwork is composed of two large drawings, fabricated into the glass panels by Tom Patti Design, and installed facing each other in the stationÕs platform shelter. On the track side, the drawing reveals the cross section of the Victorian boat house interior. Intricate machinery calls to mind Port JervisÕs glorious history as an industrial hub. A cargo ship in a glass bottle commemorates the Delaware and Hudson Canal, while stoneworkers prepare bluestone for shipment. Blossoming natural forms represent the communityÕs love and care for the environment. A diversity of native plants and animals populate the scenes.

On the ramp side, visitors encounter the busy and colorful facade of the fun and hybrid architecture: part home, part boat, part parade float. The artwork plays with light. Transparent windows of all shapes and sizes frame scenes on the opposing side. These windows become peepholes for viewing, generating playfulness and interactivity.

For Veve, ÒPlay in transparency and windows of various shapes and sizes add dimension and an interactive element throughout the work. For the curious visitor, the historical and imaginative scenes in the artwork will illuminate a complex and brilliant portrait of the city.Ó",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/boat-house-buggy
Metro-North,Mount Vernon 3rd Avenue Bridge,New Haven,Damien Davis,Empirical Evidence,2021,Aluminum,"Damien DavisÕ artwork for the 3rd Avenue bridge in Mount Vernon, ""Empirical Evidence,"" references ancient and contemporary cultures through non-linear abstracted and stylized symbols that Ñ like an urban landscape Ñ constitute a whole, made up of distinctive parts. DavisÕ artwork measures approximately 400 square feet across 11 panels, fabricated by KC Fabrications, installed on the bridgeÕs east facade.  

Empirical Evidence is made up of interwoven shapes that form a new visual lexicon and iconography of symbols from Black history and popular culture. The artworkÕs title, ""Empirical Evidence,"" directly references the scientific use of the term: concepts and/or information received by means of observation and the documentation of patterns and behavior. This title and its meaning also allude to DavisÕ continued artistic pursuit of unpacking the visual language of cultures both domestic and abroad, questioning how these cultures code and decode representations of Blackness and Black people.  

The artist shared, ""Ultimately, the work is about language and how powerful language can be, for both clarity and confusion. I want all the work I make to serve as a bridge. I think about language as a bridge, and symbols as language. For me, the question becomes how we take these larger complicated ideas, that can be hard to explain, break them down into simple shapes, and then allow new dynamic, complicated conversations to form around them. That is my hope for this project.Ó  

""Empirical Evidence"" invites the public into dialogue and interaction, providing myriad cultural reference and entry points for the multifaceted Mount Vernon community. ""Mount Vernon has existed for a very long time as a site of Black excellence,"" Davis said. ""When I think about the history of Black excellence in a larger context Ñ the ancient, the current, and the future Ñ I see Mount Vernon as having a critical role in all of it. I see this project as a celebration of, an amalgamation of, the work we have done; the work we continue to do; and the work still needed to be done.""",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/empirical-evidence
NYCT,1 Av,L,Katherine Bradford,Queens of the Night; Superhero Responds,2021,glass mosaic,"Katherine BradfordÕs artwork reflects on the community that uses the 1 Av station. Her vibrant compositions, fabricated in glass mosaic by Mayer of Munich, are located in the north and south mezzanines near First Avenue, and in three of the newly opened staircases at the Avenue A end of the station.  

In the First Avenue north mezzanine, figures in lime green, aquamarine blue, and rosy pinks gather in a group (as riders do on subway platforms) and are depicted under the glow of a massive moon. Two characters from this assembly are also seen in the Avenue A northeast staircase. Caped heroes, a recurring image in BradfordÕs body of work, guide riders in and out of the northwest and southeast stairs at Avenue A. In the First Avenue south mezzanine, riders are greeted by a dusky blue individual donning a gown in a field of flowers.  

The figures seen in the mosaic panels represent  (L) train riders. The line transports creative people pursuing their dreams and real-life heroes who provide essential services. In New York, these riders are often dressed in black, which Bradford believes is ""merely a cloak over an inner life that is wildly colorful and unconventional.""  

ÒI want to give back to these subway travelers their own sense of whimsy,"" Bradford says. ""I want to give them the possibility of stories that evoke enchantment over reality and a kind of technicolor backdrop to their subway experience.Ó  

The beings that populate the scenes are ethereal and intriguing, inspiring the viewer to reconsider the outward expression of oneÕs own interior vivacity. These mystical figures express the energy of camaraderie when people are gathered, and the power of collective experience.

Inspired by Walt Whitman's ""Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,"" the sun and moon rise and set on the city and its constant flow of people throughout time. Depicted in radiant gold and dazzling blue, 400 square feet of glass mosaic, fabricated by Mayer of Munich, appear in locations at the mezzanine and new stairways at the Driggs Avenue end of the station.  

The artwork draws upon the artistÕs early experiences coming to New York and living in Williamsburg, with scenes of graceful dancers, whimsical characters, and a radiant sun and moon. Employing different illustration styles, the work presents a timeless tableau celebrating New YorkÕs history and its people.

In each theatrical composition, an arabesque patterned curtain adorned with fairy tale figures provides an enchanting proscenium stage setting for these tableaux. The scenes are populated by elegant ballet performers that appear throughout DzamaÕs oeuvre of drawings and paintings. Mischievous characters pop up throughout, and representing historical Brooklynites such as Bugsy Siegel and Captain Jonathan Williams, founder of Williamsburg.  

""In these works it is my intention to bring the sun, the sky, and the moon to the underground,"" Dzama said. ""What I love most about New York is its people, and for me it was important to represent them and all of their wonderful complexities and diverse beauty in the piece.

The title, ""40û54Õ37.9ÓN 73û50Õ33.5ÓW,"" provides the GPS coordinates for the exact center of the bridge.  

Composed of 14 dynamic waterjet cut panels, fabricated by Milgo/Bufkin, and spanning approximately 550 square feet, the artwork features densely patterned words, undulating throughout the span of the bridge and evoking a train yard of crisscrossing tracks. The text is intended to be seen as an all-over pattern, and for viewers to spot singular words and phrases, or to see full sentences over time. To create the content for the text, Fox researched the history and factual information about Mount Vernon, reflected on his own experience in the city, and undertook in-depth conversation with local historians. While not necessary to the experience of the visual artwork, the text is a playful statement from the point of view of the bridge, its place in the world and time, and its relationship to the train that runs below.  

The artist writes, ""My idea for the 10th Avenue bridge in Mount Vernon was to create a work that is visually fluid and lively while engaging passersby in a game of discovery about the site of the bridge and its relationship to the city and surrounding area. The design, formed with handwritten cursive, is an original legend that includes details about Mount VernonÕs history and people as well as scientific fact about the viewerÕs experience at the site.

LIRR,New Hyde Park,Port Jefferson,Sandy Litchfield,Forestation Syncopation,2021,Laminated glass,"Sandy LitchfieldÕs ÒForestation SyncopationÓ unveils the ways natural and built environments interact, as seen from the train journey on the Long Island Rail Road through to New Hyde Park and the surrounding area. Situated in two westbound platform shelters and one eastbound platform shelter, each window portrays a distinct view of a landscape impression, as if catching a glimpse of morning sun before work, or the flicker of light through the trees on the way home to Long Island after a day in New York City.  

Blending geometric and organic shapes, these long horizontal abstract landscapes are conscious of the architectural structure they inhabit. Evergreens and oaks mingle with streetlights and water towers; electric wires extend into maple tree branches; clusters of houses intersperse with forest islands and leafy backyards. The everyday moments captured in these images celebrate the sylvan suburbs of the New Hyde Park area of Long Island. 

With an emphasis on color and light, the artwork incorporates the painterly application of watercolor complemented by linear details that define intersecting edges. The original artwork was made using a hybrid process of hand drawing and painting and digital technologies and was then fabricated into 36 laminated glass panels by Mayer of Munich. 

ÒForestation SyncopationÓ references the rhythmic flows and interruptions of a musical score. Syncopation is a musical term that involves a variety of rhythms which are in some way unexpected, and often considered a vital element in holding a musical track together. Forestation is the establishment of forest growth on areas that either had it previously or lacked it naturally. Together, these concepts describe a continuous landscape that binds and connects the urban town-scape to the tree-lined streets and parks of New Hyde Park, as well as railway system which connects them all.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/forestation-syncopation

""Illuminations,"" based on original paintings by Westly, was translated into laminated glass and powder finished steel located throughout the new overpass towers, the stationÕs ticket office, and two platform shelters, as part of Long Island Rail RoadÕs Main Line Expansion project. 

Fabricated by Glasmalerei Peters Studio, the glass artwork imbues vibrant scenes with lush colors featuring designs inspired by wampum belt designs, racecars, Tuskegee Airmen, farmstands, and the local childrenÕs library. Throughout the over 750 square feet of laminated glass panels, Westly tells a dynamic visual story of Westbury by depicting the old Cream Blossom Diary farm, local houses of worship, a Tuskegee airman, and the HicksÕ estate and nurseries. Joining divergent narratives, the glass compositions speak to broader themes of inclusivity and connection. Bold, dynamic colors and grand architectural elements frame scenes of WestburyÕs past while leaving areas transparent for commuters to reflect on their role in WestburyÕs present.

The metal artwork design on either side of the station ticket office is also rich with symbolism. Fabricated by KC Fabrications, the metal artwork graphically represents motifs seen in the glass artworks like the racecars and horses referencing the old Roosevelt Raceway, airplanes nodding to the areaÕs ties to aviation, and boats alluding to the migration of Quakers to the area. Chain-link patterns framing the metal panels take on the dual meaning of the history of enslavement and the bonds that now hold diverse communities together.

Five individual mosaics by the acclaimed artist are located across two levels of Grand Central Madison. The glass mosaics, totaling over 1,400 square feet, were fabricated by Mayer of Munich, with whom Smith has been creating works over the last 25 years. The artwork builds on the motif of the natural world that Smith has explored for decades. 

""River Light"" greets riders entering the new terminalÕs concourse from the historic Grand Central Terminal. The nearly 800-square-foot mosaic is inspired by the way sunlight glints on the surface of the East River, the threshold between Manhattan and Long Island. There are four mosaic murals located in arched node walls throughout the Mezzanine level: ""The WaterÕs Way, "" ""The Presence,"" ""The Spring,"" and ""The Sound."" These bring flora and fauna into the new terminal and conceptually relate with Grand Central and Long Island.

NYCT,Times Sq-42 St,"S,B,D,F,M",Nick Cave,"Each One, Every One, Equal All",2022,Mosaic,"NEED 2022 UPDATE

""Every One,"" the first and largest section of Nick CaveÕs new permanent project, ""Each One, Every One, Equal All,"" is now on view in the 42 St Connector. Comprising mosaic and video, ""Every One"" runs the length of the new in-system transfer passage linking Times Sq-42 St (from the 42 St Shuttle platform) and Bryant Park.
 
Cave states: ""Times Square is one of the busiest, most diverse and fabulously kinetic places on the planet. For this project I took the above ground color, movement, and cross-pollination of humanity, bundled it into a powerful and compact energy mass that is taken underground. 'Every One' places the viewer within a performance, directly connecting them with the Soundsuits as part of an inclusive community of difference.""

Cave is best known for his Soundsuits, wearable sculpture which camouflage the body within, creating a second skin to conceal race, gender and class, freeing the wearer and forcing the viewer to look without judgment. With references to African ceremonial costumes and masks, armor, couture fashion, and Carnival, CaveÕs elaborate armatures offer both protection and freedom when worn. Constructed from everyday objects and found materials such as colored hair, crocheted doilies, buttons, beads, fabric, raffia, twigs, toys, and trinkets, the sounds produced by the suits through activation give the artworks their name.  

""Every One"" runs 360 linear feet and covers over 3,200 square feet. It includes more than two dozen Soundsuits, some larger than life and bursting with joy. Cave's design uses recomposed source photos of Soundsuits, taken by James Prinz. The outcome defies the static form of mosaic and becomes animated by the movement of individuals passing by. Like the suits themselves, the installationÕs shifting scale and perspectives test the boundaries of visibility. Even in their ability to delight, there is power and command in their presence.

CaveÕs Soundsuits are also brought to life in a companion video piece of the same name. ""Every One"" is displayed frequently on eleven OUTFRONT liveboard digital screens, centrally located in the 42 St Connector. The video depicts the Soundsuits, many of which can be seen in the surrounding mosaic, fully activated by the movement of dancers.

The art and architecture engage the customer in a colorful visual journey between the stations at Times Square and Bryant Park, two iconic locations. Colors within the glass mosaic are mirrored in the architectural finish on the corresponding South wall. The design for the ceramic tile color-banding was created by the artist in tandem with the 42 St Connector architects, di Domenico + Partners. Commuters and tourists are invited to marvel in the expression of color and movement now permanently part of the Times Square experience.

""Every One"" will be joined by two additional mosaics, ""Each One"" and ""Equal All,"" also fabricated by Mayer of Munich and scheduled for installation at Times Sq-42 St next year. When complete, ""Each One, Every One, Equal All"" will be nearly 4,600 square feet total, CaveÕs largest permanent public art to date as well as one of the largest mosaic project in the New York City Transit system.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/each-one-every-one-equal-all
LIRR,Elmont-UBS Arena,Hempstead,Shawna X,Cyclical Everything,2022,Laminated glass; stainless steel,"At the Elmont-UBS Arena Station, a series of vibrant glass panels and geometric metal railings by the graphic artist Shawna X enliven the first new Long Island Rail Road station built in almost 50 years. Titled Cyclical Everything, the artwork uses an oval motif referencing the nearby racetrack and arena. The form represents the evolving and transformative nature of Elmont and the many distinctive cultures at home around the historic Belmont Park racetrack.

A series of ten vivid glass panels saturate the station overpass. Bodies in motion appear within pulsating oval forms, referencing the musicians, athletes, and performers at the newly built UBS Area. Tom Patti Designs fabricated the glass artwork transforming Shawna XÕs bold colorful shapes into multidimensional colors with varying opacities.

Metal railings on the eastbound platform and ramp of the westbound platform echo the glass panels by abstracting the symbolic track motif into striking rhythmic forms. Fabricated by KC Fabrications, the black metal panels feature lines of varying widths alluding to the constant of the Belmont Park racetrack, a hamlet that has evolved significantly throughout its history, from farmland to the residential neighborhoods of a diverse community and nationally recognized education system.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/cyclical-everything
LIRR,Grand Central Madison,City Terminal Zone,Yayoi Kusama,"A Message of Love, Directly from My Heart unto the Universe",2022,Glass mosaic,"""A Message of Love, Directly from My Heart unto the Universe (2022),"" by internationall renowned artist Yayoi Kusama, is located in Grand Central Madison, on the Madison Concourse between 46th and 47th streets. Expanding upon Kusama's iconic ""My Eternal Soul"" series, the new glass mosaic artwork is an exploration of lines and forms, detailed with bold colors. At once abstract and figurative, the artwork highlights a variety of motifs for visitors to discover. They convey the messages of LOVE, UNIVERSE, PEACE, and OWE TO ALL MANKIND, which are central to Kusama's oeuvre. She hopes that the work will bring joy for those who encounter it as they pass through the incredible new space.

Kusama began the ""My Eternal Soul"" series in 2009. The paintings in the series feature the signature qualities of her ""Infinity Net"" paintings and echo the obsessive, recurring geometries of her decades-long output. An exploration of form, subject matter, and space, the compositions combine abstract and figurative elements that allude at once to microscopic and macroscopic universes. ""A Message of Love, Directly from My Heart unto the Universe"" offers viewers a continuous, flowing expanse that renews these familiar motifs and symbols from ""My Eternal Soul.""

The permanent artwork, fabricated by Miotto Mosaics Art Studios, measures 120' wide x 7' high, with approximately 875 square feet of glass mosaic. ""A Message of Love, Directly from My Heart unto the Universe"" is a heartfelt gift to New York City by the artist. An accompanying poem written by Kusama speaks directly to all that will experience her artwork from near and far.

This is Yayoi Kusama.
I offer you a message of love, directly from my heart unto the universe.
May you all experience the true beauty of loving humanity.
Human life is beautiful.
My wish is to deliver this vision, with all that is in my life, to the people of New York.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/a-message-of-love-directly-from-my-heart-unto-the-universe
NYCT,181 St,1,Carmen Lizardo,Great Waves of Immigration,2023,Glass mosaic,"ÒGreat Waves of ImmigrationÓ by artist Carmen Lizardo invites commuters to reflect on the generations who have made New York City and the Washington Heights neighborhood home through colorful mosaic artworks at the 181 St station. A total of three murals are located within the north mezzanine, one next to the newly installed elevators and the other two on the walls above the north stairs that lead to the northbound and southbound platforms. The mosaic murals were fabricated by Mosaicos Venecianos de MŽxico and encompass approximately 370 square feet of wall space.

LizardoÕs project encapsulates the immigrant experienceÑleaving home, enduring the arduous journey, and eventually arriving in an unfamiliar city. With Great Waves of Immigration, the artist seeks to acknowledge the Washington Heights communityÕs historical migration patterns, which has given rise to its large Dominican population. She was inspired by the neighborhoodÕs architecture and beauty, exemplified by the iconic George Washington Bridge, images of which are superimposed and layered within the murals.

Juxtaposed with these representations of iconic landmarks are portraits of the many people who travelled across vast bodies of water to settle in the area, the most recent of which include the Dominican community. Across from the turnstiles, the largest mural is divided into two parts using a yellow and gold color scheme. In the foreground is a giant overfilled yola, a Dominican boat used to make the journey over to U.S. territory. Above the downtown stairwell is a portrait of a woman holding part of a certificate of citizenship, and in the uptown stairwell is an image of an unidentified woman whose last living address was in Washington Heights. Together, these artworks remind the viewer of the diverse and ever-changing populations that have long called New York City home.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/great-waves-of-immigration

NYCT,7 Av,Port Jefferson,David Rios Ferreira,Landscapes adrift-cosmically woven and earthly bonded,2023,Glass mosaic,"At the 7 Av station, artist David Rios Ferreira transforms twelve historic advertising niches and the North Mezzanine Passageway into portals connecting present-day concepts of home with a shared cultural connection to the planet across time. Inspired by the stationÕs proximity Prospect Park and the snapping turtles and read-eared sliders that reside there, FerreiraÕs artwork ""Landscapes adriftÑ cosmically woven and earthly bonded combines his graphic science-fiction drawing style with iconography drawn from ancient and Indigenous mythologies, local architecture, and the natural world. Miotto Mosaic Art Studios fabricated the artwork in glass mosaic and installed it in conjunction with ADA accessibility upgrades for the station.

Along the North Mezzanine Passageway, drawings of iridescent turtles populate the curved wall while recontextualized depictions of neighborhood maps, buildings, and plants emerge from their shells. These turtles hold significance in creation stories shared by Indigenous peoples such as the Lenape and those of the Northeastern Woodlands, as well as in Hindu and Chinese mythologies, where the earth is believed to be carried on the back of a giant turtle. Derived from interpretations found in scientific journals and Indigenous cultures, FerreiraÕs turtles bridge the natural world with the mystical.

Ferreira continues the use of iridescent glass in the advertising niches as cropped views of the turtles and their shell architecture appear within the rectangular frames. Reminiscent of swirling algae in lakes, the iridescent glass background also evokes a sense of the otherworldly and cosmic as mosaic tesserae glisten as customers move through the station. FerreiraÕs artwork encourages viewers to reflect on the changing histories and landscapes of the neighborhood while providing a fantastical narrative to show connections across cultural traditions.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/landscapes-adrift

LIRR,Roosevelt Island Ventilation Structure,City Terminal Zone,Diana Cooper,Double Take,2023,Ceramic Mosiac & Steel,"Located on Roosevelt Island, the permanent artwork by Diana Cooper, Double Take, is visible from the F train subway stop and is part of the East Side Access project that brought Long Island Rail Road service to Grand Central Madison in Manhattan. Cooper was initially inspired by the visual experience of traveling through the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel and moving from an artificial underground environment into a world of steel, glass, and stone in Manhattan, with buildings set at different angles and punctuated by blue skies and waterways.


When she visited the MTA site, Cooper was struck by how similar her experience was to the one subway riders have when they arrive on Roosevelt Island. Riders leave the reflected light of the subway tunnel to scale long metallic escalators and emerge into a building with large glass windows and views of the island greenery and the blue of the East River.

CooperÕs designs consider the geometric forms found in the ventilation building, the Queensboro Bridge, the MTA subway station, Louis KahnÕs FDR Memorial, and the Roosevelt Island Tram, set against the grand backdrop of the East River. The wall designs marry abstract geometric shapes with organic forms, based on photographs she took of the river, as well as hand drawn imagery of fluid forms with colors that evoke the IslandÕs grass and trees. The gate design refers directly to the buildingÕs louvers but is more colorful, playful, and permeable. Her hope is that people will feel transported smoothly and delightfully from the canyons of the MTA to an island surrounded by a river, with mountains of skyscrapers as backdrop.

Diana Cooper explained, ÒOn first visiting the site I was struck by its visual potential. One emerges from the subway to see sky, a bridge, water, a ventilation structure, and Manhattan behind it all. ThatÕs quite a mix. I wanted to pull all these elements together and somehow capture in a single work the dynamic energy latent in the experience. My aim was to blend the rigid geometric elements with fluid color to capture the play of light on the water especially. It was an exciting project that opened up new avenues in my artistic practice.Ó",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/double-take
LIRR,Mineola,Port Jefferson,Donald Lipski,Bessie and Roxey,2023,Cast bronze; porcelain enamel plaque,"At the LIRR Mineola station, a majestic 20-feet tall bronze sculpture titled ÒBessie and RoxeyÓ by the artist Donald Lipski playfully commemorates two separate but interconnected figures of Long Island history. Aviator Bessica (Bessie) Raiche and Roxey, the LIRR dog, are joined in a pose reminiscent of the Statue of Liberty, forever preserving their stories of courage and determination.

Lipski deeply researched the history of the figures and their ties to Mineola before embarking on creating the sculpture. On September 16, 1910, Raiche became the first woman in the United States accredited with piloting an airplane solo. She and her husband built the biplane she flew in their Mineola home and later started their own company in the town building aircrafts and giving flying lessons. Roxey, RaicheÕs companion in the sculpture, became the LIRR mascot after he found his way to Garden City Station on a train in 1901. Roxey was beloved by railroad crew and passengers and held an official pass to sit wherever he chose while train hopping. On several occasions, the LIRR dog traveled with President Theodore Roosevelt in his private car to Oyster Bay and visited the PresidentÕs home at Sagamore Hill. After years of traveling across Long Island, he passed away in 1914. Loyal commuters continue to freshen his water bowl where he lies in rest next to Sunrise Highway at Merrick Station. A plaque further detailing the lives of Bessie and Roxey is located on the station house exterior near the sculpture.

Standing on a stone base, the towering duo can be seen in the station plaza and from across the platform. Lipski collaborated with Christopher Collins, modeling artist, to create the figures. Art Castings of Colorado fabricated the towering project in bronze and finished the sculpture in a patina, giving the sculpture an immediate sense of history.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/bessie-and-roxey
NYCT,Grand St,L,Glendalys Medina,Gratitudes off Grand,2023,Glass mosaic,"In the mosaic artwork Gratitudes off Grand at the upgraded Grand Street (L) station in Brooklyn, Glendalys Medina reflects on their COVID-19 pandemic practice of taking 15-minute walks to get outside and cultivate gratitude. For the Grand Street station project, Medina would walk in each cardinal direction originating at station, return to their studio, and record the colors associated with memories cultivated during their strolls. Medina then used these colors to create abstract studies that build on their existing practice inspired by Ta’no culture, Hip- hop and Latinx culture and music, and the way humans create sense out of the world, such as the way brains organize patterns.

The two mosaic panels at the Grand Street station appear on each platform mezzanine. On the Brooklyn-bound side, Medina reflects on the various communities who have comprised East Williamsburg and Bushwick over time. The large color fields represent the original Lenape inhabitants and Pan-African, Irish, Italian, Puerto Rican, and Dominican immigrants. On the Manhattan-bound side, more intimate color studies were derived from the artistÕs experience of the neighborhood across seasons. A nearby church, birds in the springtime, the Moore Street Market, and the collar of a passing dog provided inspiration for these compositions of interlocking forms that call to mind schematic design drawings. Fabricated by Miotto Mosaic Art Studios, the two panels feature overlapping shapes that allow the eye to complete forms that are disrupted, inviting viewers to look a little longer and contemplate gratitude.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/gratitudes-off-grand
NYCT,E 149 St,6,Glenn Goldberg,Bronx River,2023,Glass mosaic,"At the E 149 St station, the mosaic artwork ""Bronx River"" by Glenn Goldberg unfolds across two sections located on the mezzanine level. Goldberg was inspired by the recent efforts made by environmental groups to clean and restore the Bronx River and sought to create a lush landscape featuring the riverÕs natural inhabitants. Patterned representations of egrets, wood ducks, and other birds populate GoldbergÕs scenes as trees and flowers emerge near the flowing river. Improvisational, repetitive dots, a hallmark of GoldbergÕs art practice, appear throughout the composition, which was fabricated into mosaic and installed by Miotto Mosaic Art Studios.

With his artwork, Goldberg aims to remind urban subway riders about their connection to the local landscape and encourage their participation in its appreciation and upkeep. Goldberg cited the many natural attractions in the Bronx, such as the New York Botanical Garden, Bronx Zoo, Pelham Bay Park, Orchard Beach, and Bronx River, as rich sites of exploration for city dwellers. Goldberg hopes his colorful, patterned river scenes and its various creatures enliven commutersÕ days and encourage mindfulness related to the important, nearby water source.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/bronx-river
SIR,New Dorp,City Terminal Zone,Keri Sheheen,Creeping on Where Time Has Been,2023,Laminated glass; stainless steel,"At the SIR New Dorp station, artwork by Keri Sheheen honors the areaÕs natural landscapes and rich architectural history. Metal and glass panels line the walkway to the elevator on the Tottenville-bound platform, and screen-printed and hand painted art glass panels are installed on both sides of the station house portico. The installation, titled ÒCreeping On Where Time Has BeenÓ, totals around 350 square feet of glass and metal artwork fabricated by Mayer of Munich and Ferra Designs, Inc.

The bold artwork is an appreciation of the boroughÕs historical architecture and includes imagery of notable structures such as the Vanderbilt Mausoleum and New Dorp Beach bungalows. Sheheen drew from her research of the station area with the Historic Richmond Town Archive and New York Transit Museum Archive, as well as firsthand accounts from her mother who grew up in New Dorp. Sheheen went to high school near the station and currently resides nearby.

Noting the presence of ivy-covered farmhouses that date prior to the 1960s development of suburban housing in the historical photographs, Sheheen created a visual pattern to connect the window and railing designs. The artwork title, a line from the poem ÒThe Ivy GreenÓ by Charles Dickens, is an allusion to the ivy motif that symbolizes the persistence of time and natureÕs substantial presence on Staten Island despite manmade developments.

A suite of nine cut metal panels lines the walkway to the new elevator on the Tottenville-bound side of the station and features blue, yellow, and red glass squares lining the top and bottom of the panels. The colorful border is also seen on the laminated glass panels of the station porticoes and references the stained glass of the original 1889 station house, which was relocated to Historic Richmond Town in 1965. In the metal design, the ivy motif is a backdrop to stylized beach bungalows alluding to New DorpÕs past as a turn-of- the-twentieth-century beach resort destination. Sheheen based the bungalow representations on historic buildings such as the Lang's Hotel, the Elm Tree Lighthouse, the Munger on the Beach Hotel, and the Cedar Grove Clubhouse.

The St. George-bound side of the station portico features a towering rooster in a nod to the farmland that once stretched across the neighborhood and acts as a greeter for morning commuters. The rooster stands over Britton Cottage, originally on New Dorp Lane, which was home to famous botanist Nathanial Lord Britton, founder of the New York Botanical Garden. It is one of the oldest structures on Staten Island and was also moved to Historic Richmond town.

On the Tottenville-bound side is a serene evening scene for commuters returning home. A deer, common on Staten Island, stands over an illustration of the Vanderbilt Mausoleum located in nearby Moravian Cemetery. Cornelius Vanderbilt owned the New York Central Railroad and one of the first ferry services from Staten Island to Manhattan, indelible contributions to the daily commute of Staten Islanders.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/creeping-on-where-time-has-been
NYCT,DeKalb Av,"B,D,Q",Bill Brand,Masstransiscope,1980,"Hand painted panels, Lighting","A disarmingly simple artwork, placed in the unused subway station at Myrtle Avenue in 1980, has been restored. Masstransiscope turns the subway into a movie machine, presenting a colorful, animated ""moving picture"" to commuters as the train moves through the tunnel. With heavy cleaning by volunteers, the artwork became visible again in 2008. 

The artwork has been viewed by millions of commuters from subway cars leaving the northbound platform of the DeKalb Avenue station on the express track. The 228 hand-painted panels are viewed through a series of vertical slits set into a specially constructed housing that runs the full 300' length of the old station. The piece works on the principle of the Zoetrope, a 19th century optical toy. 

The movement of the train passing in front of the exhibition creates the illusion of a 20-second animated movie. In a regular movie the film passes through a projector to create an illusion of motion and the audience sits still. With Masstransiscope it is the audience that moves while the film stays in place.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/masstransiscope
NYCT,Dyckman St,1,Wopo Holup,Birds in Flight-Moon View,1991,Ceramic relief on mezzanine walls,"In creating the artwork for the Dyckman Street station, Wopo Holup found inspiration in nature. Birds in Flight-Moon View consists of ceramic tile reliefs of birds in flight that were originally installed in 1991 (and titled Birds in Flight) within the white tile of the mezzanine wall and stairwells. With the opportunity presented when the station was recently rehabilitated, the artist was commissioned by MTA Arts for Transit and created white ceramic, low relief tile of the moon and earth surrounded by a white mosaic banding. The new work provides an extraordinary modern view of the earth as seen from the moonscape (from the Apollo missions). Blending with the existing station tiles, the circular shapes of the composition compliment the arched windows of the historic station and expand the view from the earlier artwork, by continuing the sky view-further up and out.

In the artistÕs words, ÒBirds in Flight-Moon View greets customers upon entering the station and emphasizes nature and the vastness of the universe.Ò Nature and biological forms of the urban landscape are brought within the interior environment of the station for the public to enjoy.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/birds-in-flight-moon-view
NYCT,Fulton St,"A,C,J,Z,2,3,4,5",Frederick Dana Marsh,"Marine Grill Murals, c. 1913 for the McAlpin Hotel",2000,Glazed terracotta murals and painted cast iron gates,"At the opening of the twentieth century, numerous lavish hotels were built in New York to respond to a prosperous new class of business travelers and tourists.  The McAlpin was one of these; located at 34th Street and Broadway, it set a new standard of luxury, becoming one of the places to see and be seen.  In 1912 or 1913, artist Frederick Dana Marsh created a series of twenty terra cotta murals for its walls, all with maritime themes in celebration of the importance of New York as a seaport.  

Staten Islandðs Atlantic Terra Cotta Company fabricated the murals.  Converting Marshðs drawings to clay was a complex process that required enlarging the original art, creating a complete version in clay, and then cutting this apart to create a plaster mold for each piece, so that multiple copies of each mural could be made.  Each piece was then glazed and fired a number of times, resulting in a much finer and more nuanced work than is usually the case with decorative terra cotta.  

Marsh enjoyed a successful career creating mural art, beginning with his 1890s training at the Art Institute of Chicago, which coincided with the creation of murals at the cityðs gargantuan 1893 Columbian Exposition, where he worked as an assistant to many of the nationðs most prominent mural artists.  After study in Paris, he returned to New York where he was offered several high-profile public and private commissions, including the murals at the McAlpin, which made his reputation.

But times and tastes change, and the hotel and the murals found themselves no longer in vogue ð hence the conversion of the hotel into cooperative apartments and removal of the murals to storage, where they remained for  a decade, under the guardianship of the Landmarks Preservation Commission.  In 2000, six of the murals were reinstalled, under the auspices of Arts for Transit.  Also rescued from the Marine Grill was its famed ironwork entrance gate, which has been installed in the station complex to be both decorative and functional.  All of this blends perfectly, both aesthetically and philosophically, with the terra cotta murals installed elsewhere in the system by the original builders of the subway.
The rebuilding of the station, as part of the Fulton Street Transit Center, is underway.  The reconfiguration of the A C mezzanine requires the muralsð deinstallation, restoration and relocation to the new Williams Street entrance to the A C and 2 3.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/marine-grill-murals
NYCT,Times Sq-42 St,"A,C,E,N,R,S,Q,1,2,3,7",Jack Beal,The Return of Spring; The Onset of Winter,2001,Glass Mosaic,"In these dramatic murals the artist, Jack Beal, cleverly likens the subway to classical myths that deal with the relationship between goings-on on aboveground and below ground. 

Trained in art school as an abstract expressionist, Jack Beal soon turned toward figuration in his works, eventually achieving great success and becoming a leading realist.  He often stated, ÒI will never be satisfied until I obtain the believability of the seventeenth century Dutch painters.Ó    Ironically, now his interest has turned back to abstraction, he says.

The artist explains that he based this work on the Greek myth of Persephone.  In The Return of Spring mythological figure Persephone is shown running to her mother, Demeter, according to the terms of a pact Demeter had made with Hades, PersephoneÕs husband: Persephone would be allowed to return to earth and her mother for the rest of eternity Ð provided that she ate nothing before leaving the Underworld.  But Ð shades of Eve in Eden Ð Persephone spied a pomegranate on the way out and could not resist taking a bite . . . 

The Onset of Winter completes BealÕs story.  Persephone, having eaten the pomegranate, now is forced to renegotiate the contract.  From now on, she is allowed to spend six months on earth, but must spend the other six down below, autumn and winter in the Underworld with her husband and spring and summer aboveground with her mother Ð thus the origin of the seasons.  A rueful Persephone is shown at the top of the stairs, knowing she must descend but not wanting to go. 

As with Lichtenstein and Lawrence, place and time Ð a particular place and a particular time, but with an implied universality Ð are the theme.  Time passes, people and things come and go, but there is always a dŽjˆ vu quality lurking just beneath the surface.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/return-of-spring

An environmental artist, Holt creates art by giving physical form to universal cycles of the sun, moon, and stars.  Previous work concentrating on the heavens has included her Sun Tunnels (Great Basin Desert, Utah, 1973-76), a site-specific work with four tunnels aligned to the rising and setting of the sun on the summer and winter solstices.  In the upper half of each tunnel are holes in the configuration of a constellation, the holes differing in diameter according to the magnitude of the stars they represent.  The sun, also a star, shines through the holes casting ellipses and circles of light on the bottom of the tunnels during the day.  HoltÕs Dark Star Park (Rosslyn,  Arlington, Virginia, 1979-1984) is an urban renewal project consisting of pipes, tunnels, circular pools and spheres that the artist thinks of as fallen stars.

In Astral Grating, Holt has surrounded lights with graduated circular rings making domed openings in a dropped steel grate ceiling.  ""The rings and light fixtures in this ceiling light sculpture are in the configuration of the stars in five constellations: Aries, Auriga, Canis Major, Cygnus and Piscus Austrinus,"" says Holt.  The number of lights in a cluster and the diameter of the domed openings vary in size according to the brightness of the stars represented.   The heavens have thus been brought underground.

Talking about Subway Riders 45 years after he completed it, the artist reflected:

IÕd ride the subway every day, back and forth to my machine shop job. IÕd ride and ride and sketch and sketch.  I love the subway.  It pulls the city together, pulls people together in a magic way.  Here I show the subway riders at night after a hard dayÕs work.  Everyone is separate, alone, but very much together.  ItÕs noisy with the creaks and squeals, but peaceful too, because we move to a rhythm and cadence that gets inside us; thatÕs comforting, like the noise of the city itself.  The subway makes the city work, makes the city great.  And behind the scenes Ð unseen and unheard Ð the transit workers drive the trains, grease the wheels, and keep the engines running.  They perform miracles.  They get us through another day.

A lifelong New Yorker, Ralph Fasanella was born in the Bronx and grew up in Greenwich Village, which at that time had a large Italian-American population but whose already sizable community of artists and writers was continuing to grow.  He worked as an iceman and then as a union organizer, while on the side produced a number of paintings in what would become known as urban folk style.

Although his first exhibition was in the 1940s, Ralph Fasanella was essentially unknown to the larger public until the 1970s, when folk art collectors avidly began to vie for his works.  Many of his paintings have somber overtones, focusing on political and labor struggles.  Others have happier subjects, including sports, the cityÕs dynamic street life Ð and of course subway rides.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/subway-riders-fasanella
