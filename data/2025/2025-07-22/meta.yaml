    Photograph of the artwork 'Kings Highway Hieroglyphs' (1987) by Rhoda Yohai
    Andors at the Kings Hwy subway station. The mural features six outlined
    human figures standing in profile, each with one arm raised. The figures are
    each set on their own vertical panel with a blue background, and the three
    on the left face the three on the right, separated by an orange stripe.
    Above and below the figures are rows of stylized pictograms of things like
    clouds, an airplane, a bridge, a roller coaster, a helicopter, fish, and
    birds, modern visual symbols echoing ancient hieroglyphs. A plaque with more
    information about the artwork is visible but illegible. Subway turnstiles are
    visible in the foreground, with directional signs for 'Manhattan' and
    'Coney Island' hanging above. Photo by Rhoda Yohai Andors via MTA Arts &
    Design at https://www.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/Kings-Highway-Hieroglyphs.
