# U.S. Judges and the historydata R package

This week we're exploring U. S. judge data from the {historydata} R package! 
This package is [looking for a new maintainer](https://github.com/ropensci/historydata/issues/23).
If you are interested in this dataset (and other datasets of historical information), please consider volunteering!
Check out the rOpenSci Blog [What Does It Mean to Maintain a Package?](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/02/07/what-does-it-mean-to-maintain-a-package/) by MaÃ«lle Salmon for more information.

Note: The package help for this dataset links to a particular PDF with some information about judgeships, but the actual source data can be found at [Biographical Directory of Article III Federal Judges: Export](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/biographical-directory-article-iii-federal-judges-export) on the [Federal Judicial Center](https://www.fjc.gov/) website.

> This dataset contains information about the appointments and careers of all federal judges in United States history since 1789. It includes judges who "judges presidentially appointed during good behavior who have served since 1789 on the U.S. District Courts, the U.S. Courts of Appeals, the Supreme Court of the United States, the former U.S. Circuit Courts, and the federal judiciary's courts of special jurisdiction." Some of the unnecessary information from the source has been excluded.

- How many judges have Pacific Islander as part of their designated race?
- Which Presidents appointed the most judges? The fewest?
- Which political parties have appointed the most judges to courts of customs or internation trade? Due to some coding issues in the current version of the {historydata} package, you may need to combine some terms to find all such appointments.

Thank you to [Jon Harmon, Data Science Learning Community](https://github.com/jonthegeek) for curating this week's dataset.

## The Data

```r
# Using R
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR R package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-06-10')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 23)

judges_appointments <- tuesdata$judges_appointments
judges_people <- tuesdata$judges_people

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

judges_appointments <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-06-10/judges_appointments.csv')
judges_people <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-06-10/judges_people.csv')
```

```python
# Using Python
# Option 1: pydytuesday python library
## pip install pydytuesday

import pydytuesday

# Download files from the week, which you can then read in locally
pydytuesday.get_date('2025-06-10')

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub and assign to an object

judges_appointments = pandas.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-06-10/judges_appointments.csv')
judges_people = pandas.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-06-10/judges_people.csv')
```

```julia
# Using Julia
# Option 1: TidierTuesday.jl library
## Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/TidierOrg/TidierTuesday.jl")

using TidierTuesday

# Download files from the week, which you can then read in locally
download_dataset('2025-06-10')

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub and assign to an object with TidierFiles

judges_appointments = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-06-10/judges_appointments.csv")
judges_people = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-06-10/judges_people.csv")

# Option 3: Read directly from Github and assign without Tidier dependencies
judges_appointments = CSV.read("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-06-10/judges_appointments.csv", DataFrame)
judges_people = CSV.read("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-06-10/judges_people.csv", DataFrame)
```


## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) report, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R, Python, or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
- [Submit your own dataset!](../../../pr_instructions.md)
