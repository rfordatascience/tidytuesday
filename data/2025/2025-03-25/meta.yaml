    A scatter plot comparing word frequencies in annual reports from 2005–2013
    and 2014–2023. Each orange dot represents a word, with its position indicating
    how often it appeared in the two time periods. A dashed diagonal line
    represents equal frequency across both periods. Some words, such as
    'cash,' 'tax,' and 'billion,' appear more frequently in the later period.
    Others, such as 'stock' and 'million,' appear less often in the later
    period. A note explains that 2014–2023 word counts are adjusted to account
    for the extra year in that period.
