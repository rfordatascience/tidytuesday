This week we're exploring the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) archive.
APOD is a popular NASA website featuring daily astronomy related images with a scientific explanation.  
Each day a different image or photograph of our universe is featured, along with a brief explanation. 
This APOD archive contains image information from the 2007 - 2025, pulled together into the {astropic} R package.

- What types of objects are most common in the archive?
- Are any images posted more than once?
