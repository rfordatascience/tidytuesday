The squirrel is wearing pants, a collared shirt, and loafers, and he's looking like he's waiting for the red phone in front of him to ring. He's sitting below a sign that says The Squirrel Census Dept. of Data - NYC. There are binoculars on the desk and sign that says Dept. of Data New York City. The bookshelves next to the desk have books titled Squirrel Supplemental, The Urban Squirrel and Nuts.",
