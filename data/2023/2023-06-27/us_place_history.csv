Within the past two years (2006-2007)the city of Tombstone has made significant progress toward correcting problems that placed Tombstone on the Threatened level in 2004. In 2005 the Arizona SHPO and NPS-Heritage Partnerships Program initiated a three-day workshop and planning charette, which included community members who are interested in establishing a long-term restoration plan for the Historic District. As a result of this charette several problem historic buildings are now being restored by their owners, who intend on meeting the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. A long-range plan is now in place that will eventually transform historic Allen Street into a linear park. Consequently, Old Fire Station No. 1 on Allen Street has been saved from near collapse, historically appropriate shade trees have been planted along Allen Street, and this street has been re-surfaced in a manner that is appropriate for its period of historic significance (1880-1931).

Some bought lots and built homes but Ulrich's plan never evolved.  The name is possibly derived from a procedure Ulrich performed called diathermy, a therapy using heat from condensed radio waves to relieve bone and muscle ailments.  Residents also believe that radio broadcasting, including advertising for the Radioville community, and its developing popularity may have also encouraged the name.  Today the community is not much more than a crossroads east of Pulaski."

Fell and his son Edward anticipated the potential for this area and established it as a separate city in 1763.  By 1773 it had been annexed by Baltimore along with nearby Jones Town.  Fells Point maintained a battery from 1776 to 1783 as part of its military defense of Baltimore during the Revolution.  The post Revolutionary War economy boosted trade and the development of the area.  For many years Fells Point served as the main port of Baltimore due to the deep water in Northwest Harbor.  By 1800 the community was growing into a world-renowned ship building center, known especially for the Baltimore Clippers, a very agile and fast ship.  Fells Point was listed as the first National Registered Historic District in Maryland in 1969.  (US-T121)"

2045148,NA,"An acronym for SOuth of HOuston (pronounced ""how-stun"") Street. This eclectic neighborhood in lower Manhattan had a long history before becoming New York City's artistic haven. This part of New York City with lots of cast-iron warehouses and cobblestone streets came to life in the 1850s after its residential population moved further north.  Manufacturing businesses moved in for a time but by the 1900s they too had relocated their businesses uptown and left a decrepid, low-rent, sweat-shop filled area known as Hell's Hundred Acres.  New labor laws required the sweat-shops to move and slowly people of all kinds moved back into the neighborhood which is now a mixture of residential and comercial buildings and home to a thriving artists scene."
