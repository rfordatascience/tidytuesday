# Patient Risk Profiles

The virtual [R/Pharma Conference](https://rinpharma.com/) is happening this week!
To celebrate, we're exploring Patient Risk Profiles. 
Thank you to [Jenna Reps](https://github.com/jreps) for preparing this week's data!

> This dataset contains 100 simulated patient's medical history features and the predicted 1-year risk of 14 outcomes based on each patient's medical history features. The predictions used real logistic regression models developed on a large real world healthcare dataset.

Note: We did *not* clean the column names this week. 
This data looks more like the sort of data you're likely to encounter in the wild, so we thought it would be good practice to work with it as-is.

## The Data

```{r}
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-10-24')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2023, week = 43)

patient_risk_profiles <- tuesdata$patient_risk_profiles

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

patient_risk_profiles <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2023/2023-10-24/patient_risk_profiles.csv')
```

## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
