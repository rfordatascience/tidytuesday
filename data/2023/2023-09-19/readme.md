# CRAN Package Authors

It's time for [posit::conf(2023L)](https://posit.co/conference/)!
To celebrate, the data this week comes from the [CRAN collaboration graph](https://github.com/schochastics/CRAN_collaboration), a project by David Schoch.

> The CRAN collaboration graph consists of R package developers who are connected if they appear together as authors of an R package in the DESCRIPTION file.

> The “Hadley number” is defined as the distance of R developers to Hadley Wickham in the collaboration graph. 

See the [README of the GitHub project](https://github.com/schochastics/CRAN_collaboration#readme) for a fun exploration of the data, and to see how it was gathered.

## The Data

```{r}
# Scroll to the end of this code block to see how to recombine the data into a
# graph!

# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-09-19')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2023, week = 38)

cran_20230905 <- tuesdata$cran_20230905
package_authors <- tuesdata$package_authors
cran_graph_nodes <- tuesdata$cran_graph_nodes
cran_graph_edges <- tuesdata$cran_graph_edges

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

cran_20230905 <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2023/2023-09-19/cran_20230905.csv')
package_authors <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2023/2023-09-19/package_authors.csv')
cran_graph_nodes <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2023/2023-09-19/cran_graph_nodes.csv')
cran_graph_edges <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2023/2023-09-19/cran_graph_edges.csv')

# Reconstruct a graph
library(tidygraph)
cran_graph <- tbl_graph(
  nodes = cran_graph_nodes, edges = cran_graph_edges, directed = FALSE
)

# Fine a particular author in the graph.
target_author <- "Jon Harmon"
target_author_index <- which(igraph::V(cran_graph)$name == target_author)

# Extract that author's Hadley number.
igraph::V(cran_graph)$dist2HW[target_author_index]
```

## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.

### Cleaning Script

The data was mostly cleaned by [David Schoch](https://github.com/schochastics).
Additional cleaning was performed to save simple representations of the graph, and then to check that it worked.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(igraph)
library(tidygraph)

working_dir <- here::here("data", "2023", "2023-09-19")

package_authors <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schochastics/CRAN_collaboration/main/processed_data/package_authors.csv")
cran_graph <- readRDS(url("https://github.com/schochastics/CRAN_collaboration/raw/main/processed_data/coauthor-biggest_comp.RDS"))

# me <- "Jon Harmon"

# V(cran_graph)$dist2HW[idx]

cran_tidygraph <- cran_graph |> 
  tidygraph::as_tbl_graph()

cran_graph_nodes <- cran_tidygraph |> 
  tidygraph::activate(nodes) |> 
  tidygraph::as_tibble() |> 
  # The "dist2HW" column is problematic. Simplify!
  dplyr::mutate(dist2HW = as.integer(dist2HW))

cran_graph_edges <- cran_tidygraph |> 
  tidygraph::activate(edges) |> 
  tidygraph::as_tibble()
