  "pic1_alt": "A line plot of Union Membership Rates for Wage and Salary Workers from 1983 to 2022. The x-axis is the year, labeled 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. The y-axis is percent covered (by union contracts), ranging from 0.0 to 40.0. A line for public sector workers is at the top between 30 and 40 percent, with a peak in the early 1990s and a decline in recent years. The trend for all workers is below that, starting around 20 percent and declining to about 10 percent in recent years. The line for private sector workers is almost identical, but shifted down a few percent.",
  "pic2_alt": "Three line plots of Union Wage Premium by Sector from 1983 to 2022. The plots are labeled All, Private, and Public. Each shows a trend line for the unadjusted wage premium (with a typo missing the 'd' in 'unadjusted') and another trend line for the adjusted premium. The x-axis is year, labeled by decade from 1980 to 2020. The y-axis is the log-wage differential, ranging from 0 to 0.3. Similar to the plots for union membership, the trend lines for All and Private have declined since the 1980s, starting around 0.2 to 0.3, and dropping to about 0.1 or lower. The trend lines for Public sector jobs show less of a trend, and the difference between adjusted and unadjusted curves is larger. The unadjusted premium ranges from about 0.18 down to 0.1, while the adjusted premium remains close to 0.1, with a slight increase then decrease. An annotation notes that adjusted premium controls for worker and job characteristics."
