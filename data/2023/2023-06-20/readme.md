### Please add alt text to your posts

Please add alt text (alternative text) to all of your posted graphics
for `#TidyTuesday`.

Twitter provides
[guidelines](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/picture-descriptions)
for how to add alt text to your images.

The DataViz Society/Nightingale by way of Amy Cesal has an
[article](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81)
on writing *good* alt text for plots/graphs.

> Here's a simple formula for writing alt text for data visualization:
> \### Chart type It's helpful for people with partial sight to know
> what chart type it is and gives context for understanding the rest of
> the visual. Example: Line graph \### Type of data What data is
> included in the chart? The x and y axis labels may help you figure
> this out. Example: number of bananas sold per day in the last year
> \### Reason for including the chart Think about why you're including
> this visual. What does it show that's meaningful. There should be a
> point to every visual and you should tell people what to look for.
> Example: the winter months have more banana sales \### Link to data or
> source Don't include this in your alt text, but it should be included
> somewhere in the surrounding text. People should be able to click on a
> link to view the source data or dig further into the visual. This
> provides transparency about your source and lets people explore the
> data. Example: Data from the USDA

Penn State has an
[article](https://accessibility.psu.edu/images/charts/) on writing alt
text descriptions for charts and tables.

> Charts, graphs and maps use visuals to convey complex images to users.
> But since they are images, these media provide serious accessibility
> issues to colorblind users and users of screen readers. See the
> [examples on this page](https://accessibility.psu.edu/images/charts/)
> for details on how to make charts more accessible.

The `{rtweet}` package includes the [ability to post
tweets](https://docs.ropensci.org/rtweet/reference/post_tweet.html) with
alt text programatically.

Need a **reminder**? There are
[extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitter-required-alt-text/fpjlpckbikddocimpfcgaldjghimjiik/related)
that force you to remember to add Alt Text to Tweets with media.

# UFO Sightings Redux

The data this week comes from the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/webreports/ndxshape.html), [cleaned](https://github.com/jonthegeek/apis/blob/main/01_ufo-data.qmd) and [enriched](https://github.com/jonthegeek/apis/blob/main/01_ufo-enrich.qmd) with data from [sunrise-sunset.org](https://sunrise-sunset.org/) by [Jon Harmon](https://github.com/jonthegeek/apis/).

If this dataset looks familiar, that's because we [used a version of it back in 2019](https://tidytues.day/2019/2019-06-25). The new version adds the last several years of data, adds information about time-of-day, and cleans up some errors in the original dataset. We'd love to see visualizations describing the differences between the 2019 dataset and this new dataset!

### Get the data here

```{r}
# Get the Data

# Read in with tidytuesdayR package 
# Install from CRAN via: install.packages("tidytuesdayR")
# This loads the readme and all the datasets for the week of interest

# Either ISO-8601 date or year/week works!

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-06-20')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2023, week = 25)

ufo_sightings <- tuesdata$`ufo_sightings`
places <- tuesdata$`places`
day_parts_map <- tuesdata$`day_parts_map`

# Or read in the data manually

ufo_sightings <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2023/2023-06-20/ufo_sightings.csv')
places <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2023/2023-06-20/places.csv')
day_parts_map <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2023/2023-06-20/day_parts_map.csv')
