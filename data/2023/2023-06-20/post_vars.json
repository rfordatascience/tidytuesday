The diagram is a circle, with 'Day' in yellow above the horizon, running from sunrise on the right through sunset on the left. The twilights are labeled just below the horizon on each side, in order they're civil, nautrical, and astronomical twilight. Night runs from roughly the end of civil twilight on either end."
