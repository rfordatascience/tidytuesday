# Holiday Movies

Happy holidays!
This week we're exploring "holiday" movies: movies with "holiday", "Christmas", "Hanukkah", or "Kwanzaa" (or variants thereof) in their title!

The data this week comes from the [Internet Movie Database](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/).
We don't have an article using exactly this dataset, but you might get inspiration from this [Christmas Movies](https://networkdatascience.ceu.edu/article/2019-12-16/christmas-movies) blog post by Mil√°n Janosov at Central European University.

## The Data

```{r}
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-12-12')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2023, week = 50)

holiday_movies <- tuesdata$holiday_movies
holiday_movie_genres <- tuesdata$holiday_movie_genres

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

holiday_movies <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-12-12/holiday_movies.csv')
holiday_movie_genres <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-12-12/holiday_movie_genres.csv')
```

## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
