# Holiday Episodes

Happy holidays!
Last week we explored ["holiday" movies](../2023-12-12/readme.md).
This week we're exploring "holiday" TV episodes: individual episodes of TV shows with "holiday", "Christmas", "Hanukkah", or "Kwanzaa" (or variants thereof) in their title!

The data this week again comes from the [Internet Movie Database](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/).
We don't have an article using exactly this dataset, but you might get inspiration from the TVTropes [Holiday Episode](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolidayEpisode) article.

## The Data

```{r}
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-12-19')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2023, week = 51)

holiday_episodes <- tuesdata$holiday_episodes
holiday_episode_genres <- tuesdata$holiday_episode_genres

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

holiday_episodes <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-12-19/holiday_episodes.csv')
holiday_episode_genres <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-12-19/holiday_episode_genres.csv')
```

## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
