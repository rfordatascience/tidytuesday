The youngest child is wearing a yarmulke, and the eldest is dressed in a costume. The primary title of the episode is simply 'Chanukah', but the cover of the VHS release is 'A Rugrats Chanukah'.",
  "pic2_alt": "A bar chart of 'Holiday' episodes per show. The bars alternate in festive green and red colors. Each bar represents the number of holiday episodes per show, and the height of each bar is the number of shows with that count. 1013 shows have 1 holiday episode, 213 have 2, 83 have 3, 37 have 4, 19 have 5, 9 have 6, 4 have 7, and 8 have 8. There are 2 shows with each of 9, 11, or 12 episodes, and 3 shows each with 10 or 13 episodes. 1 show has 21 episodes, another has 27, and finally 1 has 30 holiday episodes. That show isn't labeled in the figure, but it is a show called 'Nostalgia Critic', which titles its episodes by the episode it is critiquing, and it often critiques holiday episodes."
