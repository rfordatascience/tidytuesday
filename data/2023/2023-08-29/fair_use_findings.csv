De Fontbrune v. Wofsy,39 F.4th 1214 (9th Cir. 2022),2022,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiffs own the rights to a catalogue comprised of 16,000 photographs of Pablo Picasso’s work, which was originally compiled by Picasso’s friend in 1932 (the “Zervos Catalogue”). In 1995, after obtaining permission from Picasso’s estate to publish a work illustrating and describing works by Picasso, Defendants Alan Wofsy and his company Alan Wofsy & Associates began publishing The Picasso Project—–a series of volumes reproducing images of Picasso’s work, including 1,492 photographs from the Zervos Catalogue. Plaintiffs sued for copyright infringement. A French court held the photographs were protected by copyright because they “added creative features through deliberate choices of lighting, the lens, filters, [and] framing or angle of view.” In 2001, Plaintiffs obtained a judgment in France that subjected Defendants to damages for any further acts of infringement. In 2012, after discovering copies of The Picasso Project in a French bookstore, Plaintiffs enforced their judgment in France and were awarded €2 million. Plaintiffs sought recognition of the judgment in the U.S. courts. The district court granted summary judgment for Defendants, determining that the French judgment was “repugnant to U.S. public policy protecting free expression” because it failed to provide a fair use defense. Plaintiffs appealed; and Defendants cross-appealed on other defenses.",Whether reproduction of photographs documenting artwork in a reference book that was sold commercially is a fair use.,"The panel held that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, weighed against fair use because Defendants conceded that The Picasso Project was a commercial venture and the use at issue—reproduction of the photographs in a book illustrating Picasso’s works—was not transformative. Specifically, the court noted that Defendants’ use “did not serve an ‘entirely different function’ than the originals,” but had overlapping purposes, and the insertion of informative captions did not “necessarily” transform the works. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, did not favor fair use because, although the works were published and documentary in nature, the French court had concluded that the photographs exhibited creative elements. The court determined that the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, weighed against fair use because Defendants failed to demonstrate that “copying the entirety of each photograph was necessary.” The fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, also weighed against fair use because there is a presumption of market harm when the use is commercial and non-transformative. Although Defendants presented evidence that auction prices for the Zervos Catalogue increased while The Picasso Project was on the market, Defendants had not provided evidence that “widespread appropriation” of the works would not harm the market for the photographs. Weighing all the factors, the court had “serious doubts” that fair use would protect Defendants’ use, and, accordingly, granted summary judgment to Plaintiffs on the public policy defense.",Education/Scholarship/Research; Photograph,Fair use not found
Sedlik v. Von Drachenberg,"No. CV 21-1102, 2022 WL 2784818 (C.D. Cal. May 31, 2022)",2022,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff Jeffrey Sedlik is a photographer who created an iconic portrait of musician Miles Davis, which he has licensed for various uses (the “Portrait”). Defendant Katherine Von Drachenberg, professionally known as Kat Von D, is a celebrity tattooist. In 2017, Kat Von D inked a tattoo on the arm of a friend, Blake Farmer, as a gift. Farmer chose the Portrait as the reference image for his tattoo. Kat Von D traced a printout of the Portrait to create a line drawing and stencil to transfer to Farmer’s arm, then completed the tattoo freehand. Kat Von D and the tattoo shop hosting her both posted a photograph of Kat Von D tattooing Farmer’s arm with the Portrait in the background, as well as a photograph of the finished tattoo. Kat Von D also posted a short video of herself inking the tattoo. Sedlik sued and moved for summary judgment on his claim of copyright infringement. Defendants moved for summary judgment, asserting fair use.",Whether use of a photograph as the reference image for a realistic tattoo is fair use.,"Considering the first fair use factor, the purpose and character of the use, the court found triable issues as to the transformativeness and commercial nature of the work. The court rejected Kat Von D’s arguments that the tattoo was transformative because of Farmer’s personal connection to the image in the Portrait and by nature of it being permanently imprinted on Farmer’s body. The court concluded that a jury should determine whether the visual differences between the Portrait and the tattoo, such as additional shading and the elimination of the black background, are significant enough to render the tattoo transformative. The court also stated that a jury should decide whether Kat Von D’s use of the work was commercial, noting that she did not charge Farmer for the tattoo but could have derived an indirect economic benefit from promotion of the tattoo on social media. The court found that the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, favored fair use because although the Portrait is creative, it was published several decades ago and has been widely disseminated. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, weighed against fair use because Kat Von D chose to copy certain expressive elements of the Portrait that were not necessary to achieve her stated purpose of expressing “a sentiment of melancholy.” On the fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, while the court concluded the tattoo was not a substitute in the primary market for the Portrait, it found that Sedlik raised a triable issue as to whether a future market exists for licensing the Portrait for use in creating tattoos. Because the court found triable issues concerning the statutory factors, it declined to address a non-statutory factor raised by defendants—“fundamental rights of bodily integrity and personal expression”—and concluded that fair use in this case should be decided by a jury.",Painting/Drawing/Graphic; Photograph,Preliminary finding; Fair use not found
"Sketchworks Indus. Strength Comedy, Inc. v. Jacobs","No. 19-CV-7470-LTS-VF, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86331 (S.D.N.Y. May 12, 2022)",2022,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff Sketchworks Industrial Strength Comedy, Inc. (“Sketchworks”) is a sketch comedy company that created and owns a copyright in Vape, a stage musical that is an alleged parody of the theatrical work and film, Grease. Vape follows the same characters along roughly the same story-arc and in the same setting as Grease and incorporates portions of the film’s music. Defendants are the trustees for the individual trusts of the co-authors of Grease. Just before Vape was scheduled to be performed, Defendants sent Sketchworks and the theater where Vape was to be performed cease and desist letters, and the performances were cancelled. Sketchworks brought an action against Defendants seeking a declaratory judgment that Vape constitutes fair use of Grease, asserting that Vape is a parody that uses millennial slang, pop culture references, and exaggeration to comment on Grease and criticize its misogynistic and sexist elements. Defendants disputed that Vape is a parody and asserted that it infringes their copyright in Grease. The parties cross- moved for judgment on the pleadings.","Whether the use of protected elements, including music, plot, characters, dialogue, and setting, from a theatrical work and film to create a parodic stage musical is fair use.","The court found that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, favored fair use because Vape is a parody of Grease and is therefore transformative. Critical to this determination, the court found that Vape juxtaposed “familiar elements from Grease, such as the main characters and the plot arc, with alterations to the script and song lyrics” to highlight the experiences of Grease’s female characters and “comment on how misogynistic tendencies have both evolved since Grease was developed and remain the same.” The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, disfavored fair use because Grease’s creative expression fell “within the core of the copyright’s protective purposes.” The court, however, declined to give this factor much weight, reasoning that parodies typically copy publicly known, expressive works. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the use, weighed in favor of fair use. Although Vape took “substantial elements” from Grease, the court found that “the taking was not excessive” because use of those elements was necessary to achieve Vape’s parodic purpose and communicate its criticism of certain aspects of Grease. The fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, also weighed in favor of fair use because any potential harm to Grease’s market value for derivatives was likely “minimal.” While Vape updated some of the language and cultural references from Grease, the court found that Vape “cannot be reasonably viewed as a derivative ‘sequel to, . . . or updated remake, of Grease,’” because its updates were done “in a spirit of mockery.” Further, the court commented that any effect on the demand for derivatives attributable to Vape’s “critical nature” is not remediable under copyright law. Weighing the four factors together, the court concluded that Vape constitutes a fair use of Grease and granted Sketchworks’ motion for judgment on the pleadings.",Film/Audiovisual; Music; Parody/Satire; Review/Commentary,Fair use found
"Am. Soc'y for Testing & Materials v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc.","No. 13-cv-1215 (TSC), 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60922 (D.D.C. Mar. 31, 2022)",2022,United States District Court for the District of Columbia,"Defendant Public.Resource.Org, Inc., a non-profit organization, has a mission to make the “law and other government materials more widely available so that people, businesses, and organizations can easily read and discuss [the] laws and the operations of government.” Plaintiffs consist of three non-profit standards-developing organizations: (1) “ASTM,” which is focused on industry-related technical and safety standards; (2) “NFPA,” which is focused on safety standards; and (3) “ASHRAE,” which is focused on construction-related standards. Plaintiffs own copyrights in various “voluntary consensus standards,” which are developed by numerous subject matter experts under Plaintiffs’ guidance. Plaintiffs sell PDFs and hard copies of their standards and maintain reading rooms for viewing the standards. Defendant purchased hard copies of Plaintiffs’ standards and, without authorization, scanned and made digital, verbatim, copies freely available online to the public. This case concerns 191 ASTM standards, 23 NFPA standards, and 3 ASHRAE standards that Defendant claims have been incorporated by reference into federal law. Plaintiffs brought copyright, trademark, and unfair competition claims; Defendant countersued, seeking declaratory judgment. The parties filed motions for summary judgment. In 2017, the district court found that all factors weighed against fair use. On appeal, the court of appeals reversed in part and remanded the case back to the district court without a detailed discussion of the fair use factors for additional factual development. On remand, both parties again moved for summary judgment.","Whether it is fair use to make available online for free a verbatim copy of privately developed standards, which have been incorporated by reference into law, without obtaining authorization from the copyright owner.","As directed by the court of appeals, the district court conducted a four-step fair use analysis for each of the 217 allegations of infringement, concluding that Defendant’s reproduction of 184 standards was fair use, reproduction of 32 standards was not fair use, and that portions of the reproduction of 1 standard was fair use. For all 217 standards, the court found that the fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the work, favored fair use. Having found that Defendant’s use was noncommercial, the court determined that Plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence to show some meaningful likelihood of future harm exists. The court noted that it was “less deferential” to Plaintiffs’ “conclusory opinions” about market harm given that, during the elapsed time since the alleged infringement and the commencement of the litigation Plaintiffs could have provided “economic data and analysis” supporting their arguments. The court also found that Defendant’s reproductions did not have a “substantially adverse impact on the potential market for the originals.” Regarding the 184 standards that the court found Defendant reproduced fairly, the court determined that 153 were incorporated by reference into law and that the other 31 were identical in text to standards incorporated by reference. The court concluded that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, generally favored fair use because Defendant did not “stand to profit” from the reproduction and that its purpose was “to inform the public about the law and facilitate public debate.” The court noted that Defendant’s use qualified as one that “furthere[d] the purposes” of fair use, and generally provided information “essential for a private entity to comprehend its legal duties,” which weighed “heavily in favor” of fair use. In assessing the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, the court considered that “the express text of the law falls plainly outside the realm of copyright protection” and determined that consequently the standards incorporated by reference “are, at best, at the outer edge of ‘copyright's protective purposes.’” Thus, this factor weighed “heavily in favor” of fair use. The court explained that the 184 standards were incorporated into law “without limitation” such that “the consequence of the incorporation by reference is virtually indistinguishable from a situation in which the standard had been expressly copied into law.” The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, also favored fair use as the court found that “a greater amount of the standard's text might be fairly reproduced” because the incorporating regulations did “not specify” whether certain provisions, or the entire text, of the standards were incorporated by reference into law and did not indicate which specific provisions were “relevant for regulatory guidance.” Balancing the factors, the court found fair use and denied Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment regarding these 184 standards. Regarding the 32 standards that the court found were not reproduced fairly, the court noted that these standards were not shown to be incorporated by reference into law and “differ[ed] in substantive ways from those incorporated by reference into law.” Discussing the first factor, the court found that this factor weighed slightly against fair use because Defendant’s purpose of “inform[ing] the public about the law” was not “significantly furthered” by publishing standards with substantive differences from the standards that were incorporated by reference. The second factor weighed against fair use because there was no evidence showing that the standards were incorporated into law. And, although the standards were more factual than creative, the court concluded that these works “fall more squarely within the realm of copyright protection” than standards incorporated into law. The third factor weighed against fair use, as Defendant’s purpose of informing the public about the law “could be achieved with a paraphrase or summary.” The court also noted that “[i]ncorporating one standard by reference does not justify posting provisions of a different version that has not been incorporated into law.” Balancing these factors, the court did not find fair use and denied Defendant’s motion for summary judgment regarding these 32 standards. Regarding the 1 standard where the court found that portions of the reproduced standard were used fairly, only the parts incorporated by reference into a regulation were found to be fair use. In its second factor analysis, distinguishing the portions not incorporated into law, the court found that Defendant’s “wholesale reproduction” of the standard was “harder to justify” because only parts of the standard were incorporated into law.",Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual Work; Used in government proceeding,Mixed Result
Yang v. Mic Network Inc.,"Nos. 20-4097-cv(L), 20-4201-cv (XAP), 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 8195 (2d Cir. Mar. 29, 2022)",2022,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff Stephen Yang (“Yang”) licensed a photograph he took of Dan Rochkind (“Rochkind”) to the New York Post, which ran the photograph in an article about Rochkind entitled “Why I Won’t Date Hot Women Anymore.” Defendant Mic Network, Inc. (“Mic”) posted its own article entitled “Twitter Is Skewering the 'New York Post' for a Piece on Why a Man ‘Won't Date Hot Women’.” The Mic article included a screenshot of the Post article that captured the headline and a portion of Yang’s photograph. Mic did not obtain a license to use the photograph. In response, Yang sued Mic for copyright infringement, and Mic moved to dismiss, asserting fair use. The district court granted Mic’s motion, concluding that its use of Yang’s photograph was fair use. Yang appealed the order and judgment.","Whether using a screenshot from an article, including part of a photograph, to report on and criticize the article constitutes fair use of the photograph.","On appeal, the court decided that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, weighed in favor of fair use. As an initial matter, the panel held that it was not error for the district to decide transformativeness on a motion to dismiss in this case because the only two pieces of evidence needed were the original and secondary works. The court held that, in addition to identifying the subject of Mic’s criticism, Mic, also transformed the photograph by critiquing and providing commentary on the Post article. Mic did not use the photograph “merely as an illustrative aid,” and thus its use was for different purpose than the original. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, had limited weight in the court’s analysis after it held that the use was transformative and thus “d[id] not counsel against a finding of fair use.” Likewise, the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, did not disfavor fair use as the court agreed with the district court’s conclusion that Mic’s use of the image was reasonable to satirize the Post article. The court determined that the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work, also favored fair use. The court concluded that Mic’s screenshot was not a competing substitute for Yang’s work because Mic did not simply republish the photograph, but instead used a screenshot consisting of a “significantly” cropped version of the work along with the Post headline. Further, Yang failed to plausibly allege that a market exists for “photographs that happen to be featured in news articles criticizing the original article in which the photograph appeared.” Weighing the factors together, the court concluded that the district court properly dismissed Yang’s copyright infringement claim on fair use grounds.",News Reporting; Photography,Fair use found
Viacom Int’l v. Pixi Universal,"Civ. Action No H-21-2612, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57400 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 25, 2022)",2022,United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas,"Plaintiff Viacom International Inc. (“Viacom”) is the owner of the SpongeBob SquarePants (“SpongeBob”) entertainment franchise and holds over 400 copyright registrations for SpongeBob works, including the animated television series, feature films, two-dimensional drawings, and stylebooks featuring extensive artwork from the franchise (the “Works”). The SpongeBob television series features a fictional fast-food restaurant called the “Krusty Krab,” which Viacom once recreated as an immersive experience at a comics convention in 2019. Defendant Pixi Universal, LLC (“Pixi”) operates themed “pop-up” restaurants and bars. In 2021, Pixi recreated the Krusty Krab as a pop-up called “The Rusty Krab,” which featured recreations of the fictional restaurant and other elements of the SpongeBob series. Pixi charged a fee for admission and for food and drink. After demanding that Pixi cease using SpongeBob intellectual property, Viacom brought copyright and trademark infringement claims and sought injunctive relief. Pixi asserted fair use as its sole defense to the copyright claim.",Whether using elements of copyrighted works to create a themed “pop-up” business based on those works is fair use.,"The court decided that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, weighed against fair use. The court found that Pixi’s use was wholly commercial and that it did not transform the Works by merely changing the medium of expression. Instead, Pixi’s use shared the same purpose as the original, that is, “light-hearted entertainment.” Rejecting Pixi’s “post-hoc characterization” of its pop-up as a parody, the court found that Pixi embraced, replicated, and intended to profit from the Works. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, also weighed against fair use because of the “fictional, imaginative nature” of the Works. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, likewise weighed against fair use. The court determined that, although Pixi did not copy all the details of the SpongeBob universe or even specific episode storylines, Pixi’s use of “central, principal characters and iconic locals and backgrounds from the series” was nonetheless “substantial” as it used the “heart” of the Works. Lastly, the court determined that the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work, also weighed against fair use. The court found that the type of immersive experience that Pixi created, which was based exclusively on Viacom’s SpongeBob franchise, affected the potential market for Viacom to venture into creating or licensing derivative immersive works. Because the factors together weighed against a finding of fair use, the court concluded that Viacom was likely to succeed on its copyright infringement claim and granted its motion for preliminary injunctive relief.",Painting/Drawing/Graphic; Parody/Satire,Fair use not found
McGucken v. Newsweek LLC,"19 Civ. 9617 (KPF), 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50231 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 21, 2022)",2022,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff Elliot McGucken, a fine art photographer, posted several photographs he took of an ephemeral lake in Death Valley to his public Instagram account. Defendant, Newsweek LLC, contacted McGucken to request permission to upload one of these photographs (the “Photograph”) to its website, but McGucken did not respond. Newsweek subsequently embedded McGucken’s Instagram post of the Photograph in an online article about the ephemeral lake, titled “Huge Lake Appears in Death Valley, One of the Hottest, Driest Places on Earth.” McGucken brought an action for copyright infringement, alleging Newsweek reproduced and displayed the Photograph online without permission. After the court denied Newsweek’s motion to dismiss McGucken’s direct copyright infringement claim, both parties moved for summary judgment, and Newsweek again asserted that its use of the Photograph constituted a fair use.",Whether embedding a photograph posted on social media in a news article to illustrate the subject of the photograph is fair use.,"For all four factors, the court concluded that a jury must resolve genuine issues of material fact before weighing and balancing the factors. The court concluded that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, did not clearly favor either party. In the court’s view, a reasonable jury could find either that Newsweek’s use was transformative because the Photograph was used to report a newsworthy event and Newsweek added commentary or that the use was not transformative because it was a verbatim copy published with generic text. Because of unresolved factual disputes, the court could not determine on summary judgment the commerciality of the use and whether Newsweek acted in bad faith. The court explained that the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, was also unsuitable for summary judgment because, although the Photograph is creative, a jury could find that Newsweek’s use was transformative and did not interfere with McGucken’s ability to control the first public appearance of the work. The court found that the weight of the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the use, would also need to be determined by a jury relative to its assessment of the “transformative and distinctive purpose” of the use. Nonetheless, the court noted that “it is difficult . . . to see how [Newsweek] could have used less than the entirety of the Photograph.” The court concluded that the fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, required a jury to resolve factual issues concerning the extent to which Newsweek’s embedding affected the media licensing and fine art markets for the Photograph. Ultimately, the court declined to determine fair use as a matter of law, and denied both parties’ summary judgment motions.",Internet/Digitization; News Reporting; Photograph,Preliminary ruling; Fair use not found
Monsarrat v. Newman,28 F.4th 314 (1st Cir. 2022),2022,United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit,"In 2010, Plaintiff Jonathan Monsarrat created a post on a community forum discussion thread hosted on the Russian-owned social networking platform, LiveJournal. Monsarrat’s post responded to allegedly defamatory posts about him on the thread by threatening to report the other users for violations of LiveJournal’s harassment policy, which he quoted and linked to in the post. Monsarrat subsequently registered his post with the U.S. Copyright Office in 2012. In 2017, LiveJournal revised its terms of service to comply with Russian law, which permitted censorship. As a result, Defendant Ron Newman moved the forum, including Monsarrat’s registered post, to another platform, Dreamwidth, by copying the forum’s discussion threads and reposting them on Dreamwidth. Monsarrat sued for copyright infringement and Newman moved to dismiss the claim, asserting fair use. The district court held that Newman’s reproduction of the post as part of the discussion thread was fair use. Monsarrat appealed.",Whether copying a post from one social networking platform to another is fair use.,"Considering the first fair use factor, the purpose and character of the use, the court found that Newman’s reproduction was “at least marginally” transformative because Newman “reproduced Monsarrat’s work for a fundamentally different reason than that which led to its creation.” The court noted that Monsarrat’s original purpose was to “encourage users . . . to immediately stop harassing him,” which could not have been Newman’s purpose in reproducing the post several years later. The court also found that Newman’s use was noncommercial as there was no indication that Newman reproduced the post “to accrue any profit,” a conclusion supported by Monsarrat’s “repeated concession” that the post had no commercial value. Although favoring fair use, the court gave the first factor little weight. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, weighed strongly in favor of fair use because the public post was “factual and informational,” consisting primarily of a verbatim quote from the LiveJournal harassment policy and “brief workaday prose.” The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, favored neither side. The court, while acknowledging that copying the entire post could weigh against fair use, found that in this case it would have made “scant sense” for Newman to selectively copy only part of the post as that would have “misrepresented” what Monsarrat wrote. The court found the fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, weighed strongly in favor of fair use. The court relied in part on Monsarrat’s admission that there was no potential market for the post. And although the court recognized that a work’s value is not limited to monetary terms, it rejected Monsarrat’s argument that the copyright itself bestowed the work with intrinsic value because “such a value would be present in every case, and thus prove to be largely beside the point in differentiating one case from another.” Balancing the factors, the court found fair use and affirmed the judgment dismissing Monsarrat’s claim.",Internet/Digitization; Textual Work,Fair use found
Bell v. Eagle Mt. Saginaw Indep. Sch. Distr.,27 F.4th 313 (5th Cir. 2022),2022,United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,"Plaintiff Dr. Keith Bell, a sports psychologist, wrote and published Winning Isn’t Normal, a book that provides strategies for success in athletics. Bell separately registered the copyright for a 230-word excerpt from the book (the “WIN Passage”). Bell sells merchandise that displays the WIN Passage online and licenses its use. In December 2017, Chisholm Trail High School’s softball team and color guard posted the WIN Passage to their Twitter accounts, crediting Bell as the author. In November 2018, Bell notified Defendant Eagle Mountain Saginaw Independent School District that the Twitter posts infringed his copyright. In response, Defendant removed both posts, told Bell that the mistake was a “teachable moment,” and announced a training program to avoid similar incidents. After settlement negotiations failed, Bell brought an action for copyright infringement. Defendant moved to dismiss, asserting that the school’s use was fair. The district court granted Defendant’s motion and awarded it attorney’s fees. Bell appealed.",Whether use of a motivational passage excerpted from a book in social media posts by public school athletics programs constitutes fair use.,"Although Defendant conceded that the school’s use was not transformative, the court nonetheless concluded that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, favored fair use because the use was noncommercial and in good faith. Despite construing the pleadings in Bell’s favor, the court found the use noncommercial because “[t]here is no logical theory for how tweeting Bell’s motivational message to inspire students would enhance the reputations of [the school’s athletics] programs” or provide Defendant a “tangible benefit.” The court held that the school acted in good faith because Bell was credited in the posts and the school immediately removed the posts after Bell complained. The second factor, the nature of the work, disfavored fair use because, although comprised of “well-worn truisms,” when viewed in the light most favorable to Bell, the WIN Passage is “somewhat creative.” The court found that the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion of the work used, was neutral because, even if the WIN passage is the “essence of Bell’s book,” Bell himself makes the WIN passage “freely accessible” to the public and the passage constitutes only a “small excerpt” of the entire book. The fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the work, favored fair use, as the court held that a short excerpt from the book was not a competing substitute for the original. In fact, quoting a short passage “might bolster interest in the book” and related merchandise. The court found implausible the allegation that the school’s use could impact Bell’s ability to license his work, noting that Bell failed to “allege that anyone has ever purchased a license before posting the WIN Passage on social media” and that his “sole authority” for the existence of a licensing market was his own litigation efforts. Weighing the factors, the court held that the school’s use of the WIN Passage was fair and affirmed the district court’s dismissal. It also affirmed the award of attorney’s fees to deter Bell and other copyright holders from “suing public institutions and nonprofit organizations over de minimis uses.”",Educational/Scholarship/Research; Internet/Digitization; Textual Work,Fair use found
O’Neil v. Ratajkowski,"No. 19 CIV. 9769 (AT), 2021 WL 4443259 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2021)",2021,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff, Robert O’Neil, a paparazzi photographer, photographed professional model and actress Defendant Emily Ratajkowski leaving a flower shop holding a bouquet covering her face on September 13, 2019. O’Neil registered the copyright in the photograph and uploaded the photograph to his agency Splash News, which posted the photograph online for licensing. The photograph earned O’Neil minimal income. Ratajkowski posted the photograph to her Instagram Stories and added the caption “mood forever” to the bottom of the post. The post automatically deleted in 24 hours. O’Neil filed a claim for copyright infringement and the parties each moved for summary judgment on whether posting the photograph was fair use.",Whether a celebrity’s use of an unlicensed paparazzi photograph of herself in a captioned social media post that disappeared after 24 hours is fair use.,"Considering the first fair use factor, the purpose and character of the use, the court found there to be a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Ratajkowski’s use was transformative. The court observed that a jury could either view the photograph and Ratajkowski’s caption as commentary on her attempts to hide from paparazzi, which would be transformative, or as a photograph that “merely showcases [her] clothes, location, and pose at that time,” which would serve the same purpose as the original. The court noted that while Ratajkowski did not earn any money from the post, her Instagram account is a commercial enterprise. Considering bad faith, the court noted there was no evidence that Ratajowski personally removed copyright attribution from the photograph, knew that it was copyrighted, or that she took it directly from Splash News. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, marginally disfavored fair use because while photographs are creative, this particular photograph was “essentially factual in nature” because O’Neil captured Ratajkowski in public and did not direct her in any way to achieve his artistic vision. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, slightly disfavored fair use because Ratajkowski used more of the photograph than necessary for her claimed purpose of commenting on intrusive paparazzi. However, the court noted this factor is given less weight because Ratajkowski posted the photograph to her Instagram Stories, where it appeared for only 24 hours. On the fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, the court found issues of material fact remained because there was no information in the record regarding the market for individuals licensing paparazzi photographs to post on social media. Because the court found issues of material fact with respect to the first and fourth factors and found the second and third factors weighed only marginally against fair use, the court denied both parties’ motions for summary judgment regarding fair use.",Internet/Digitization; Photograph; Review/Commentary,Preliminary finding; fair use not found
"Easter Unlimited, Inc. v. Rozier","No. 18-cv-06637, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 184636 (E.D.N.Y. Sep. 17, 2021)",2021,U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York,"Plaintiff Easter Unlimited, Inc. is a business that designs, manufactures, and supplies costumes and masks, including a “Ghost Face Mask” for which Plaintiff holds a copyright registration as a sculptural work. Plaintiff licensed the mask for use in the horror film Scream, in which it was worn by a serial killer. Defendant Terry Rozier is a professional basketball player. After acquiring a reputation as a “dangerous scorer” and “fearless shooter,” fans and sports media nicknamed Rozier “Scary Terry.” Rozier created a clothing line that featured this nickname and a cartoon depiction of himself wearing a mask. Rozier specifically requested the mask used on the clothing be “the Scream mask.” Rozier sold and authorized other entities to sell the Scary Terry clothing and received approximately $150,000 in gross sales revenue. Plaintiff brought an action alleging copyright infringement of the Ghost Face Mask. Rozier asserted the use was a fair use.",Whether a professional athlete’s use of a costume mask associated with a movie serial killer in a cartoon drawing of himself next to his “Scary Terry” nickname on sports apparel is fair use.,"On the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, the court found that Rozier’s use was transformative, parodical, and satirical, which favored fair use. On transformativeness, the court determined that the purpose of Rozier’s use was to identify and connect fans with Rozier’s “Scary Terry” persona, which differed from the purpose of the original sculptural work. Although related to the licensed use of the Ghost Face Mask in Scream, rather than the original mask itself, the court concluded that Rozier’s use to “lampoon” the Scream killer could be seen as a parody commenting on the movie or the mask. In addition, the court found Rozier’s use provided a means of “satirizing and ridiculing the perception of ruthless, high- scoring [NBA] athletes.” Lastly, the court determined that the importance of commerciality was diminished by the use’s transformativeness. The second factor, the nature of the work, disfavored fair use due to the undisputed creative nature of Plaintiff’s Ghost Face Mask. The court determined that the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, was neutral because although the use involved copying a substantial portion of the mask, Rozier arguably needed to use the main features of the mask to achieve his intended purpose. On the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the original, the court concluded that the two works occupied distinct markets – finding that the primary market of holiday and party consumers for the Ghost Face Mask would not be usurped by Rozier’s sports apparel. While the Court acknowledged that similar conduct, if widespread, could adversely impact Plaintiff's potential market, those “hypothetical fair uses are not the type of contemplated use that would compel a finding” for Plaintiff. Concluding that the factors together favored fair use, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Rozier on the copyright infringement claims.",Parody/Satire; Review/Commentary; Sculpture; Painting/Drawing/Graphic,Fair use found
"Andy Warhol Found. for the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith","19-2420-cv (2d Cir. Aug. 24, 2021)",2021,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. (“AWF”) controls and licenses the works of Andy Warhol. Defendant Lynn Goldsmith is a professional photographer who took a series of unpublished photographs of the musician Prince in 1981. In 1984, Goldsmith’s agency licensed one of the photographs to Vanity Fair for use as an artist reference. Warhol referred to that photograph when he created an illustration that was published in the magazine, as well as fifteen additional silkscreen prints and drawings (the “Prince Series”). Following Prince’s death, Vanity Fair contacted AWF regarding republishing the original illustration in a tribute issue, but ultimately used a different work from the Prince Series. When Goldsmith became aware of the Prince Series, she contacted AWF and alleged copyright infringement. AWF brought a declaratory judgment action and Goldsmith countersued for copyright infringement. The district court granted summary judgment for AWF, concluding that Warhol’s use of the photograph was a fair use. Goldsmith appealed. A panel from the Second Circuit reversed in March 2021 and issued a slightly revised opinion after a motion for reconsideration in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Google v. Oracle.",Whether using a photograph of an iconic musician as the basis for a series of artworks is fair use.,"The appellate panel concluded that the district court’s entire fair use analysis was affected by its erroneous conclusion that the works were “transformative” based on a “subjective evaluation of the underlying artistic message of the works rather than an objective assessment of their purpose and character.” On the first factor, purpose and character of the use, the court emphasized that adding new aesthetic or expression to a work is not necessarily transformative. To determine whether a work is a derivative work, which requires authorization from the owner of the source material, or transformative, a court must generally consider whether the purpose of the primary and secondary works is the same. Specifically for visual arts, to be transformative, the secondary work must do more than impose another artist’s style on the primary work. “[T]he secondary work itself must reasonably be perceived as embodying a distinct artistic purpose, one that conveys a new meaning or message separate from its source material,” a standard the Prince Series did not meet. The second factor, nature of the work, disfavored fair use because the photograph was creative and unpublished. The third factor, amount and substantiality of the work used, also disfavored fair use because the “essence” of the photograph was evident in the Prince Series. The use was also not reasonable in relation to its purpose because there was no reason compelling Warhol to use this particular photograph as a reference. On the fourth factor, effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work, although the works occupied distinct markets with respect to direct sales, both AWF and Goldsmith had licensed their works to print magazines. Because AWF failed to present evidence that the Prince Series did not threaten Goldsmith’s ability to license to that market, that factor weighed against fair use. The panel concluded that all four factors favored Goldsmith and that the Prince Series works were not fair use.",Painting/Drawing/Graphic; Photograph; Unpublished,Fair use not found
"Nat'l Acad. of TV Arts & Scis., Inc. v. Multimedia Sys. Design, Inc.","No. 20-CV-7269 (VEC), 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142733 (S.D.N.Y. July 30, 2021)",2021,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiffs, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, Inc. and the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (collectively, the “Television Academies”), own the copyright for the design of a gold statuette of a winged figure holding an atom (the “Emmy Statuette”), which they use to present Emmy Awards to distinguished members in television programming. Defendant Multimedia System Design, Inc. (“MSDI”), which creates and posts content providing social and political commentary, posted a video to its YouTube channel as part of its “Crony Awards,” which celebrated countries that have downplayed the COVID-19 pandemic. The video—as well as its thumbnail and social media posts promoting it—used an image of the Emmy Statuette holding a model of the COVID-19 virus instead of an atom (the “Crony Graphic”). In response to a DMCA takedown notice, YouTube promptly took down the video. MSDI submitted a counter-notice claiming the use of the statuette was fair use. Plaintiffs filed suit asserting copyright infringement and other claims. Defendant moved to dismiss the copyright claim, arguing the use was either de minimis or fair use.",Whether the use of a modified version of a statuette used in an award show in connection with a different award show that provides political commentary is fair use.,"Considering the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, the court found that the use was not transformative, which weighed against fair use. Although MSDI made some alterations to the Emmy Statuette, the “dominant and essential aesthetic elements” of the original design remained. The court further found that both the Emmy Statuette and the Crony Graphic were used for the same purposes: to “represent awards” and “promote . . . award shows.” The court also rejected MSDI’s claim that the Crony Graphic was a parody because it did not direct any criticism towards the Emmy Statuette or the Television Academies. The court found the use to be commercial because, while MSDI did not derive direct income from the YouTube video, it included links to portals where viewers could pay for the content. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, weighed against fair use because MSDI conceded that the Emmy Statuette is “arguably creative.” The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, disfavored fair use as well because the two images were “identical other than the replacement of the atom with the COVID-19 virus,” and MSDI had not explained why it was necessary to use the Emmy Statuette specifically. The court found the fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, also slightly disfavored fair use. While the markets for the Emmy Awards and for MDSI’s video do not “meaningfully overlap,” the court concluded that the Television Academies adequately alleged that they suffered actual and reputational harm by having the Emmy Statuette associated with misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. Balancing the factors, the court held that the use was not fair use as a matter of law and denied the motion to dismiss.",Film/Audiovisual; Internet/Digitization; Parody/Satire; Photograph; Sculpture,Fair use not found
McGucken v. Pub Ocean Ltd.,"2:20-cv-01923-RGK-AS, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153361 (C.D. Cal. July 27, 2021)",2021,United States District Court for the Central District of California,"Plaintiff Elliot McGucken photographs landscapes and seascapes, which he posts to his public Instagram account. Twelve of McGucken’s Instagram posts depict photographs he took of an ephemeral lake in Death Valley (the “Photographs”). On April 15, 2019, Defendant Pub Ocean Limited (“Pub Ocean”) published McGucken’s Photographs to five websites owned by Pub Ocean as part of an article written by a freelance writer titled “A Massive Lake Has Just Materialized in the Middle of One of the Hottest Places on Earth.” The article contained ten of the Photographs, with credit to McGucken and a link to his Instagram page, as well as several photos that were not McGucken’s and commentary on the conditions in Death Valley, the Sahara, and other natural phenomenon. McGucken brought an action for copyright infringement and moved for summary judgment, asserting Pub Ocean’s use did not constitute fair use.",Whether including photographs posted on social media in a news article to illustrate the subject of the photograph is fair use when accompanied by commentary.,"The court concluded that Pub Ocean’s use of McGucken’s Photographs was fair use. The first factor, the purpose and character of the use, favored fair use because Pub Ocean’s use of the Photographs was transformative because the article included discussion of facts and commentary that provided context for the Photographs and included other photographs as well. The transformative nature of the use reduced the importance of the commercial purpose factor. The court held the second factor, the nature of the work, disfavored fair use as McGucken’s works, although previously published, are highly creative. The court found the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, favored fair use. The court concluded that, despite displaying the “heart” of the Photographs, the article expressed ideas “beyond what Plaintiff expressed in his photographs,” rendering the amount of McGucken’s copyrighted images “insubstantial in context.” The fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the work, favored fair use because Pub Ocean’s transformative use “mut[ed] the degree of market substitution.” The court also noted that McGucken licensed the Photographs to other publications after Pub Ocean published its article, which indicated that Pub Ocean’s use did not usurp or destroy the market for the Photographs.",Internet/Digitization; News Reporting; Photograph,Fair use found
"Mattel, Inc. v. Entities Doing Bus. as Unicorn Element","21 Civ. 2333 (VM), 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106188 (S.D.N.Y. June 4, 2021)",2021,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff Mattel, Inc. (“Mattel”) manufactures and sells Barbie dolls, doll clothes, and doll accessories. It markets these products in various ways, including in a style guide for a Barbie movie that contains an illustration of Barbie (the “Barbie Illustration”). Defendants are various persons and entities engaged in the online sale and distribution of doll clothes and accessories. Defendants used the Barbie Illustration in a small section of the product packaging for a doll closet. Mattel filed an action against Defendants, alleging copyright infringement for use of the Barbie Illustration and trademark infringement for use of the “BARBIE” mark in the promotion and sale of Defendants’ products. Defendants conceded that they used the Barbie Illustration on the packaging of their products and that Mattel holds the exclusive rights to the illustration, but argued that the use of the Barbie Illustration is fair use.",Whether incorporating an illustration on a small section of product packaging for a related product constitutes fair use.,"Considering the first fair use factor, the purpose and character of the use, Defendants used the Barbie Illustration commercially, which weighed against finding fair use. Defendants contended that their use was “highly transformative,” but the court found Defendants’ use was the same as Mattel’s, that is, to sell doll-related merchandise. Although it did not play a significant role in the court’s determination, the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, weighed against fair use as Defendants did not present a substantial argument that the Barbie Illustration was not the core type of work that copyright is intended to protect. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, weighed against a finding of fair use because although the Barbie Illustration is only a small portion of the Mattel style guide and of Defendants’ product packaging, Defendants used the most important and identifying portion of the Barbie Illustration, the face, and provided no convincing reason for doing so. For the fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, the court was also persuaded that this factor weighed against fair use because of the clear market harm to Mattel if Defendants and other doll clothing and accessory manufacturers were permitted to engage in this conduct. The court reasoned that if others were “given free rein” to copy Mattel’s work—even a small amount—without justification or a license, Mattel would likely be forced to continue to bring lawsuits to protect its intellectual property. Because all four factors weighed against fair use, Mattel demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits and the Court granted Mattel’s motion for prejudgment attachment.",Internet/Digitization; Painting/Drawing/Graphic,Fair use not found
"Brown v. Netflix, Inc.",855 F. App’x 61 (2d Cir. 2021),2021,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"This case involves the use of eight seconds of the song Fish Sticks n’ Tater Tots (the “Song”) in a two minute and eighty-seven second burlesque dance routine that appears in the documentary film Burlesque: Heart of the Glitter Tribe (the “Film”). The chorus of the Song consisting of the lyrics “fish sticks n’ tater tots” repeats five times in the dance routine, during which the dancer—costumed as a “reverse mermaid” with the head of a fish and legs of a woman—steps behind a sign that says “hot oil” to change into brown leggings, remove the fish head, and emerge transformed into fish sticks. The rest of the dance routine music consists of other songs. Amazon.com, Inc., Netflix, Inc., and Apple, Inc. (collectively, “Defendants”) offered the film for online streaming on their platforms. Plaintiffs, Tamita Brown, Glen Chapman, and Jason Chapman, the creators of the Song, sued the Defendants for copyright infringement. Defendants jointly moved to dismiss the claims against Netflix and Apple, and for judgment on the pleadings regarding the claims against Amazon. The district court found the Defendants’ use of the Song was fair use and resolved the claims for direct and secondary infringement in their favor. Plaintiffs appealed.",Whether use of the chorus of a children’s song to accompany a burlesque dance routine as it appears in a documentary film is a fair use.,"The appellate court held that the Defendants’ use of the Song was fair use and affirmed the district court’s judgment. The first factor, the purpose and character of the use, favored fair use because the Defendants’ use of the Song, captured as the accompaniment to a filmed burlesque performance, was merely “incidental” to the Film’s purpose as a documentary that provided “commentary on the burlesque art form” by combining performances with topical discussions of “gender, sexuality, and the artistic process.” Because the use fit into one of the illustrative examples listed in the preamble to the section of the Copyright Act that discusses fair use, the court concluded Defendants were “entitled to a presumption in favor of fair use” with regard to the first factor. The court rejected Plaintiff’s argument that it was “premature” to conclude on a motion to dismiss that the Film was a documentary and not a “scripted creative work.” The court did not squarely address the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, other than to acknowledge the district court found the factor favored neither party. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole, weighed in favor of fair use because the portion used was minimal and encompassed only eight seconds of the entire 190-second song. Moreover, the repeated use of the chorus—the heart of the Song—was “reasonably necessary” to serve the documentary purpose of showing the performance “as it happened” and Defendants were not obligated to use the “shortest possible snippet.” Finally, the fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, also weighed in favor of fair use. The court concluded that it was unlikely the Film would usurp the market for the three- minute Song because the Film only contained an eight-second portion of the Song’s chorus. In addition, even assuming that a licensing market for the Song as dance or background music existed, the “brief use of a small portion of the Song as a component of an event recorded for documentary purposes” did not “fall within the traditional or well-developed market for the Song.”",Music; Film/Audiovisual,Fair use found
"Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc.",141 S. Ct. 1183 (2021),2021,Supreme Court of the United States,"Plaintiff Oracle America, Inc. owns the copyright in the Java SE computer platform, which allows developers to use the Java language to write programs that can run on any desktop or laptop computer. The Java SE platform contains implementing code, which instructs the computer how to execute particular tasks, as well as declaring code, which provides both the name for each task the computer can perform and locates each task within the platform’s organizational system. Developers use and become familiar with specific “method calls,” which interact with the declaring code to invoke the implementing code for the task they want their program to perform. When Google created Android, its platform for mobile devices, it wrote millions of lines of new code, including all of its own implementing code. Because Google wanted programmers who were familiar with Java to be able to write programs for Android easily, it copied roughly 11,500 lines of declaring code and the underlying organizational system from the Java SE platform. At trial, the jury found that Google had infringed Oracle’s copyright, but it deadlocked on the question of whether Google’s copying was a fair use. The district court, however, found that the declaring code was not copyrightable as a matter of law and entered judgment for Google. On appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed, holding “the Java API packages are entitled to copyright protection,” and the case was remanded for a jury trial on fair use. At a second trial, the jury found Google’s use was a fair use, and the court denied Oracle’s post- judgment motions. On a second appeal, the Federal Circuit again reversed, concluding that “[t]here is nothing fair about taking a copyrighted work verbatim and using it for the same purpose and function as the original in a competing platform.”",Whether copying portions of the declaring code and organizational structure from a computer software platform for use in a new software platform to make it easier for software developers to write programs for the new platform constitutes fair use.,"Assuming “purely for argument’s sake” that the declaring code was copyrightable, the Court’s opinion focused on fair use. The Court found that fair use plays a particularly important role in cases involving computer programs because Congress relied on limiting doctrines, such as fair use, to prevent copyright holders from “using copyright to stifle innovation” when deciding that computer programs were protectable by copyright. As a threshold matter, the Court held that a reviewing court should accept the factual findings of the jury but review the ultimate question of fair use de novo because that determination “primarily involves legal work.” The Court also held that there is no right to a jury trial on the question of fair use. Turning to the fair use factors, the Court began its analysis by considering the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work. The Court found this factor favored fair use because the declaring code was further than most computer programs from the core of copyright. As an interface, the declaring code was “functional in nature” and, unlike many other computer programs, its use is “inherently bound together” with uncopyrightable ideas, developers’ method calls, and implementing code. Further, “its value in significant part derives from the value that those who do not hold copyrights, namely, computer programmers, invest of their own time and effort to learn.” On the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, the Court found that it was not sufficient to determine whether Google used the code for the same purpose Oracle used it in the Java SE platform, namely, to enable programmers to call up implementing programs that would accomplish particular tasks, because the purpose of virtually all reuses of computer programs would be to accomplish the same functional tasks they performed in the original work. The Court concluded that Google’s “reimplementation” of the Java API in Android was a “transformative” use because it “adds something new and important,” that is, it “further[s] the development of computer programs” by allowing programmers to use their existing Java skills in a new mobile platform. The Court noted that, while a use that was noncommercial would “tip[] the scale in favor of fair use,” Google’s use was commercial, but this was not dispositive in light of the transformative nature of the use. The Court declined to rule on whether evidence of good faith tends to weigh in favor of fair use. The Court held the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole, favored fair use because the 11,500 lines copied constituted only 0.4 percent of the entire Java SE platform. The Court compared the number of lines to the total number of lines of code used in the Java SE platform, rather than the number of lines of declaring code, because the declaring code is “inseparably bound” to the implementing code. The Court found the “amount of copying was tethered to a valid, and transformative, purpose,” and was not more than necessary to achieve Google’s objective, which was “not simply to make the Java programming language usable on its Android systems,” but rather “to permit programmers to make use of their knowledge and experience.” On the fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the work, the Court found the jury had heard evidence that Oracle would not have been able to enter the mobile firmware marketplace and that devices using Android’s platform and Oracle’s platform were in different markets, such that it could have found that Android did not harm Oracle’s actual or potential markets for the Java SE platform. The Court also considered the “public benefits” likely to flow from the copying as compared to the dollar amount lost, although the Court cautioned that these questions might not always be relevant to fair uses, even in the context of computer programs. The Court held that the costs of producing new declaring code that programmers would want to use would be prohibitive, and the public would be harmed if Oracle had too much power to control the development of new applications and new uses. Further, any losses Oracle incurred were due not to the expressive qualities of the declaring code, but to programmers having become accustomed to using certain method calls. Concluding the factors together supported fair use, the Court reversed the appellate judgment.",Computer Program,Fair use found
Marano v. Metro. Museum of Art,844 F. App’x 436 (2d Cir. 2021),2021,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff Lawrence Marano, a professional photographer, took a photograph of Eddie Van Halen playing his “Frankenstein” guitar at a concert (the “Photograph”). The Metropolitan Museum of Art (the “Met”), a nonprofit museum that displays works of art to the public, included the Photograph in an online catalogue for a physical exhibition on rock and roll instruments. The catalogue included 185 webpages representing the exhibit objects on physical display. The Photograph was displayed as a thumbnail image on the webpage discussing the “Frankenstein” guitar, along with a large photograph of the guitar, two thumbnail images, and two paragraphs of text describing the guitar’s history and technical specifications. Online visitors could click on the Photograph’s thumbnail to view a larger version of it. Marano sued the Met for willful copyright infringement, and the district court found that the Met’s use of the Photograph was a fair use. Marano appealed.",Whether posting a photograph in a museum exhibit’s online catalogue to depict an object shown in the Photograph is a fair use.,"The appellate panel held that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, strongly favored fair use. The Met’s exhibition transformed the Photograph by foregrounding the instrument rather than the musician playing it. The Met used the Photograph to highlight the unique design of the Frankenstein guitar and its significance in the development of rock and roll instruments. In contrast, Marano’s purpose was to show what Van Halen looked like while performing. Further, the Photograph appears alongside other photographs of the guitar and text discussing the guitar’s genesis, specifications, and impact on rock and roll music. The panel found the Met’s use not to be for a commercial purpose even though the museum charges an entry fee for some visitors because the Met’s “free and publicly available” website extends its “cultural and academic reach.” The second factor, the nature of the work, weighed in favor of Marano because the Photograph is a “creative work of art,” but the court held this factor was of “limited usefulness” given that the Met used the Photograph for a transformative purpose. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, did not weigh against fair use because, although the Met used the Photograph in its entirety, this was necessary to its purpose: serving “as one of many ‘historical artifacts’ in the exhibition.” The fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the work, favored fair use. There was no indication that the Met’s use of the Photograph on a web page describing the Frankenstein guitar could impair any other market for use of the Photograph. Rejecting Marano’s argument that a fair use holding in this case would effectively grant museums a blanket exemption from copyright infringement of photographs, the panel concluded the district court had specified that fair use determinations are case-specific; and its own analysis of the factors indicated that the Met’s specific use of the Photograph was a fair use.",Education/Scholarship/Research; Internet/Digitization; Photograph,Fair use found
Golden v. Michael Grecco Prods.,"No. 19-CV-3156 (NGG) (RER), 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43701 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2021)",2021,United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York,"Plaintiff, Lee Golden III, owns and operates a pop culture blog. In 2015, Golden published a blogpost about rumors of a possible reboot of the television show Xena: Warrior Princess (the “Post”). Golden’s post included a photograph of Lucy Lawless as Xena (the “Photograph”), which was taken by professional photographer Michael Grecco in 1997 for a photoshoot for the original television show. Grecco was paid for the images he took and he retained all copyrights to the photographs. Since 2009, Grecco had licensed Photograph through Getty Images. Although disputed by Grecco, Golden points to evidence showing the Photograph was licensed eleven times between 2010 and 2013, generating $3.94 in revenue. Golden’s blog earns money from displaying banner ads, but Golden asserts he earned no money from the Post. In 2018, Grecco discovered the Post and informed Golden of the alleged infringement of the Photograph. Golden responded by apologizing and removing the photograph, but after Grecco threatened legal action, Golden brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment that he did not violate Grecco’s copyright or, in the alternative, that he was an innocent infringer. Grecco asserted a counterclaim for copyright infringement to which Golden asserted fair use and other defenses.",Whether the use of a promotional photograph from a commercial photoshoot in a blog post reporting on the television show is fair use.,"Considering the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, the court found that Golden’s use of the Photograph was not transformative, which weighed against fair use. Although the Post could be considered “news reporting” about the potential reboot, Golden used the Photograph as an “illustrative aid,” not to provide criticism or commentary on the Photograph itself. The court also found that the Post did not transform the purpose of the Photograph from “promotion to historical artifact.” The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, disfavored fair use because the Photograph is “[a] portrait photograph that is the clear product of the photographer’s artistic choices.” The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, disfavored fair use as well because Golden used the entire image, unaltered. The court found the fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, also disfavored fair use. Although there was limited demand for licensing the Photograph, the court reasoned that the “secondary market would be meaningless if entertainment websites could use the image without paying the licensing fee, even if few or no customers showed interest in [the Photograph].” The court weighed these factors together and concluded that Golden’s use of the Photograph was not fair use.",Internet/Digitization; News reporting; Photograph,Fair use not found
"MidlevelU, Inc. v. ACI Info. Grp.",989 F.3d 1205 (11th Cir. 2021),2021,United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit,"MidlevelU, Inc., the operator of a revenue-generating website that provides resources for healthcare providers, publishes a free blog, which it makes available via an RSS feed. Newstex, doing business as ACI Information Group (“ACI”), is an aggregator of news publications. ACI created a subscription-based Scholarly Blog Index (the “Index”) that included summaries of licensed content and unlicensed content that ACI obtained by subscribing to RSS feeds, as well as bibliographic information and links to the original posts. Each Index entry also included an “iFrame”—a browsable, full-text “live snapshot” of the content that did not redirect to the original website. After discovering that ACI produced and published entries for 823 of MidlevelU’s articles, MidlevelU sent ACI a cease-and-desist letter, and MidlevelU removed the content that same day. However, entries for the content crediting ACI as the source and directing users to ACI’s site continued to appear in website repositories of subscribers. MidlevelU sued for copyright infringement and ACI, as part of its defense, asserted fair use. At trial, the jury found 43 instances of infringement and that ACI’s actions did not constitute fair use. ACI appealed.",Whether using online articles to create an index that includes article summaries and a full-text version of each article constitutes fair use.,"The court concluded that the jury could have reasonably found that the use was not fair, so ACI was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The first factor, the purpose and character of the use, weighed against fair use because a jury could have found the Index was not transformative and the purpose was commercial. The court observed that “making copyrightable material searchable does not alone change the purpose of the material” and the iFrame of each article served the same purpose as the original. The court considered the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, to be “at most” neutral. Although most of MidlevelU’s articles were largely factual, others were “more creative and speak from the author’s personal experience.” As to the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the use, the court noted that ACI essentially provided its subscribers with access to the full-text content through the iFrames and “[e]ven disregarding the iFrames, reasonable minds can differ as to whether [ACI] used more of MidlevelU’s content than necessary” in creating the Index summaries. On the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, the court observed that although MidlevelU’s articles were available for free and there no evidence of lost readership, a jury could view the Index as a market substitute for the articles as well as a “threat” to MidlevelU’s reputation due to the “low quality” of the Index summaries. In sum, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the use was not fair use.",Education/Scholarship/Research; Internet/Digitization,Fair use not found
"Apple Inc. v. Corellium, LLC","Case No. 9:19-cv-81160-RS, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 249945 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 29, 2020)",2020,United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida,"Plaintiff Apple Inc. owns the copyright in various versions of iOS, the mobile operating system that powers many Apple devices, including the iPhone. Defendant Corellium, LLC developed a product that permits users to create virtual models of iPhones by using iOS files that are available for download from Apple at no cost. Corellium’s product has limited functionality and lacks some features of interest for average consumers buying iPhones, including the ability to make phone calls, use the camera, send text messages, or access the App store. The product is intended to provide an environment that facilitates technology security research. Corellium screens customers before permitting them to use the product. After a potential deal to acquire Corellium fell apart, Apple filed suit alleging that Corellium infringed Apple’s copyrights in iOS and circumvented its security measures in violation of the federal Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). Corellium moved for summary judgment on fair use and the DMCA claim; Apple moved for summary judgment on its DMCA claim.",Whether the use of a copyrighted operating system to create a simulated security research and testing environment is fair use.,"For the first fair use factor, the purpose and character of the use, the court concluded the use was transformative because the Corellium product incorporates its own code and includes additional features not included in the iOS to create a new product that serves the transformative purpose of enabling security research. Although Corellium’s product was sold commercially, the profit motivation did not undermine a finding of fair use, “particularly considering the public benefit of the product.” For the second fair use factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, the court noted the limitations on copyright protection for functional software but found the second factor rarely played a significant role in the fair use analysis. The court concluded that the third factor, the size and significance of the portion of the copyrighted work used, weighed in favor of fair use. The court found that Corellium’s use of iOS, which excluded consumer iOS device features like the App Store and camera, was “proportional and necessary to achieve Corellium’s transformative purpose.” For the fourth factor, the effect on the potential market or value of the original, the court concluded that this favored fair use. The court did not find any significant market impact, rejecting the arguments that Corellium’s product competed with Apple’s security research product and harmed the licensing market for iOS. In addition, the court considered and did not find a “lack of good faith and fair dealing” because Corellium vetted its customers and held them to no lesser standard than Apple itself imposed in its security research program. Weighing all these factors, the court found Corellium’s use of iOS to be a fair use and dismissed the copyright claim. The court went on to deny summary judgment on Apple’s DMCA anti-circumvention claim, rejecting the argument that Corellium’s fair use defense also absolved it of liability for circumvention and concluding that genuine issues of material fact remained concerning this claim.",Computer Program; Education/Scholarship/Research; Internet/Digitization,Fair use found
"Boesen v. United Sports Publs., Ltd.","No. 20-CV-1552 (ARR) (SIL), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 240935 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 2020), reconsideration denied by 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 240935 (Dec. 22, 2020)",2020,United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York,"Plaintiff, Michael Barrett Boesen, a professional photographer, owns the copyright in a photograph that he took in 2002 of professional tennis player Caroline Wozniacki. On December 6, 2019, Wozniacki announced her retirement from professional tennis in a post on her personal Instagram account, using a cropped, low-resolution version of the photograph in the post. That same day, Defendant United Sports Publications Ltd. (“United Sports”) published an online article reporting on Wozniacki’s announcement and summarizing her tennis career, and included Wozniacki’s Instagram post as an embedded link. Boesen filed a copyright infringement suit against United Sports. United Sports filed a motion to dismiss, asserting fair use.",Whether embedding a social media post containing an unlicensed photograph in an online news article discussing the post is fair use.,"Considering the first fair use factor, the purpose and character of the use, the court found that United Sports’ use was sufficiently transformative that this factor strongly favored fair use. United Sports did not use the photograph as a “generic image” of Wozniacki to accompany the article or to “depict her playing tennis at a young age,” but rather because the article was reporting on the Instagram post and the Instagram post included the photograph. The court also noted that United Sports’ status as a for- profit publisher by itself did not demonstrate that the use of this specific photography was commercial. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, favored fair use slightly, because the photograph contains both informational and creative elements, and was previously published. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, favored fair use because it was necessary to use photograph as it appeared in the Instagram post to report on the Instagram post. The fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, also favored fair use because the photograph did not appear on its own, but as part of a social media post, which included Wozniacki’s avatar, profile name, and additional text, making United Sports’ use unlikely to affect or compete in the market for the original. Furthermore, the low-resolution, cropped version would also be a poor substitute for the original. Because all four factors favored fair use, the court dismissed the complaint. The court subsequently denied Boesen’s motion for rehearing, concluding that in her previous decision she applied caselaw reasonably, evaluated the commercial purpose adequately, and analyzed market harm sufficiently.",Internet/Digitization; News reporting; Photograph,Fair use found
"Dr. Seuss Enters., L.P. v. ComicMix LLC",983 F.3d 443 (9th Cir. 2020),2020,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiff owns the copyrights of works authored and illustrated by the late Theodor S. Geisel (a/k/a Dr. Seuss), including the book Oh, the Places You’ll Go! and two other works at issue in this case (collectively, “Go!”). Plaintiff publishes the works and licenses the works for use in other entertainment products. Defendants combined elements of Go! and the sci-fi franchise Star Trek to create the mash-up book Oh, the Places You’ll Boldly Go! (“Boldly”). Defendants copied liberally from Go! to parallel its visual style and textual structure. In a public Kickstarter funding campaign, Defendants contended that Boldly was a fair use of Go!. Plaintiff brought suit alleging copyright infringement of Go! After twice denying motions to dismiss Plaintiff’s copyright claim, the district court granted Defendants’ summary judgment motion, concluding that Boldly was a fair use of Go! Plaintiff appealed.","Whether the use of graphic, literary, and other elements from copyrighted works, where combined with elements from other works to create a “mash-up,” is fair use.","The panel found the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, weighed against fair use because Boldly’s commercial use of Seussian elements was not a parody or otherwise transformative. The court concluded that Boldly did not critique or comments on Go! as a parody would; rather, Boldly mimicked Go! and “paralleled Go!’s purpose.” On the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, the creative nature of Go! weighed against fair use. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, weighed “decisively” against fair use because Boldly closely replicated “the exact composition, the particular arrangements of visual components, and the swatches of well-known illustrations.” The court also observed that Defendants used the “heart” of the works and rejected an argument to evaluate the amount taken relative to the “entire corpus of the author.” The fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work, also weighed against fair use. The court held that, because fair use is an affirmative defense, Defendants had the burden of presenting favorable evidence about relevant markets and failed to do so. The court further observed that Boldly “intentionally targeted and aimed to capitalize on the same graduation market as Go!” and would likely curtail Go!’s existing and potential market for derivative works. Considering the four factors together, the court concluded that all factors weigh against fair use as Boldly was “a non-transformative commercial work that targeted and usurped Go!’s potential market.” Accordingly, the panel reversed the district court’s grant of summary judgment on fair use and remanded the case.",Painting/Drawing/Graphic; Parody/Satire; Textual work,Fair use not found
Castle v. Kingsport Publ’g Corp.,"2:19-CV-00092-DCLC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233919 (E.D. Tenn. Dec. 14, 2020)",2020,United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee,"This suit involves an aerial photograph taken of the proposed build site for a new high school in Sullivan County, Tennessee (the “Photograph”). The decision to build a new high school was met with controversy, due to a debate over whether or not the school was being built over sinkholes. Plaintiff, Brian Castle, used his drone to take the Photograph, which he believed proved the presence of sinkholes on the build site. Castle provided a blown-up version of the Photograph to a member of the Sullivan County School Board for presentation at a school board meeting and handed out copies, none of which included attribution or copyright notices. Castle also posted the Photograph on his Facebook page and unsuccessfully attempted to license it to local news outlets. Defendant, Kingsport Publishing Corporation (“Kingsport”), received one of the copies of the Photograph handed out at the school board meeting and published it in an article about the public debate over the high school construction, focusing on the remarks of an engineer at the meeting who rebutted the sinkhole allegations and offered an alternate explanation for what the Photograph showed. Castle asserted a claim of copyright infringement and Kingsport moved for summary judgment, asserting a fair use defense.",Whether use of an unlicensed photograph that was taken and distributed to visually support one perspective in a public controversy in a news article reporting on a rebuttal of that perspective is a fair use.,"The court found that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, favored a finding of fair use. Kingsport’s use of the Photograph was transformative because the news article “did not merely reprint the Photograph in a different medium with nothing more” or use it an “illustrative aid”; rather, it brought new meaning to the work by reporting on a contrary view from the engineer that “directly challenged . . . [Castle]’s interpretation of the Photograph.” Although Kingsport received about $15.20 in ad revenue based on web traffic from article views, the transformative purpose diminished any significance of its commerciality. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, favored fair use because the court found that the Photograph was more informative than creative in nature, and had already been published. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole, did not weigh against fair use because although the Photograph was used in its entirety, that was reasonable in the context of the news reporting on the engineer’s “explanation for the anomalies shown in the Photograph.” The fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, also weighed in favor of fair use. The court found that Castle had not shown there was a potential market for the work and that his unsuccessful attempts to license the Photograph suggested there was no such market. The transformative purpose for which Kingsport used the Photograph reduced the likelihood Kingsport’s use would be a substitute for the original. Thus, the court concluded the factors taken together favored fair use.",News Reporting; Photograph,Fair use found
Chapman v. Maraj,"No. 2:18-cv-09088-VAP-SS (C.D. Cal. Sept. 16, 2020)",2020,United States District Court for the Central District of California,"Plaintiff Tracy Chapman owns the copyright for the song Baby Can I Hold You (the “Composition”). Defendant Onika Tanya Maraj, professionally known as Nicki Minaj, experimented on a remake of the song Sorry, which she believed was an original work by Shelly Thunder but which her representatives later learned was a cover of the Composition. Minaj knew she needed to obtain a license to publish a remake of the Composition because her remake incorporated a large number of lyrics and vocal melodies from the Composition. Minaj made multiple requests to Chapman for a license, but Chapman denied each request. Minaj did not include her remake of Sorry on her album. Minaj contacted DJ Aston George Taylor, professionally known as DJ Flex, and asked if he would premiere a record that was not on her album. Minaj denies sending DJ Flex a copy of her remake of Sorry and she posted a message instructing him not to play any songs not on her album. Somehow DJ Flex obtained a copy of Minaj’s remake of Sorry and played it on the radio. Chapman sued Minaj, asserting copyright infringement. On cross-motions for summary judgment, Chapman asserted Minaj violated her copyright by creating and distributing a derivative work based on the Composition, while Minaj contended that her creation of the remake qualifies as fair use.",Whether a recording artist’s use of lyrics and vocal melodies from a musical work for artistic experimentation and for the purpose of securing a license from the copyright owner is a fair use.,"The court found that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, favored fair use. The court concluded that the initial purpose of Minaj’s new work was experimentation. Given that Minaj “never intended to exploit the work without a license” and excluded the new work from her album, Minaj’s use was not purely commercial. In addition, the court observed that “artists usually experiment with works before seeking licenses and rights holders typically ask to see a proposed work before approving a license.” The court expressed concern that “uprooting . . . [these] common practices would limit creativity and stifle innovation within the music industry.” The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, disfavored fair use because the Composition is a musical work, which is “the type of work that is at the core of Copyright’s protective purpose.” The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the work as a whole, favored fair use. Although Minaj’s new work incorporated many lyrics and vocal melodies from the Composition, the material Minaj used “was no more than necessary to show Chapman how [Minaj] intended to use the Composition in the new work.” The fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, favored fair use because “there is no evidence that the new work usurps any potential market for Chapman.” Considering the factors together, the court found that Minaj’s use was fair and granted partial summary judgment in Minaj’s favor that her use did not infringe Chapman’s right to create derivative works.",Music,Fair use found
Rimini St. v. Oracle Int’l Corp.,473 F. Supp. 3d 1158 (D. Nev. 2020),2020,United States District Court for the District of Nevada,"Plaintiff and counter-defendant Rimini Street, Inc. is a third-party service provider for enterprise software. Defendants and counter-claimants Oracle International Corp. and Oracle America, Inc. (collectively, “Oracle”) develop and license enterprise software. In a separate litigation, Rimini was found liable for copyright infringement due to its unauthorized copying of Oracle’s software, specifically by creating patches and updates developed for “one customer’s software to support other customers.” Rimini made changes to its internal company policies for servicing enterprise software in response to a court order, but the parties continued to dispute whether Rimini’s servicing activities complied with the terms of its customers’ licenses with Oracle. Rimini brought a declaratory judgment action against Oracle, seeking a declaration that its conduct under its new policies was not infringing. Oracle asserted counterclaims, including that Rimini infringed its copyrights through unauthorized copying. One of Rimini’s defenses was that its copying was fair use.",Whether it is fair use to make random-access memory (RAM) copies of a client’s licensed enterprise software for the purpose of servicing and developing software updates for the enterprise software.,"Analyzing whether Rimini’s servicing activities were authorized, the court found that although copying Oracle software into RAM and developing updates was permissible under the terms of the license, Rimini exceeded the scope of the license by creating prototypes that Rimini used for multiple customers and did not restrict its services to the “internal data processing operations” of each customer. Considering fair use, the court found the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, weighed against fair use. The court first determined that Rimini’s use is commercial in nature. Furthermore, Rimini’s use is not transformative because, although Rimini creates new code for its software updates, the updates are implemented into the original software, which still functions in the same way and for the same purpose as the original. The court distinguished this case from reverse-engineering cases that involved copying to research interoperability because Rimini creates updates that only “work within and can only be used with the existing . . . software.” The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, also weighed against fair use because the “unique business enterprise software” was “clearly protected.” Unlike cases where disassembly was necessary to determine the functional aspects of a program, Rimini had no similar need as it was “permitted to make copies . . . to make updates and fixes to the software” so long as the activity was “within the scope of the license.” The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work taken, also cut against fair use because the RAM copies contain a substantial portion of Oracle’s software, and the portion copied is essential for creating and testing updates. Lastly, the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the market for or value of the copyrighted work, weighed against fair use because Oracle intended to occupy the market for aftermarket support for its software and Rimini’s “creation, testing, and distribution of . . . derivative works will undoubtedly impact Oracle’s ability to function in that market.” Weighing the factors together, the court concluded Rimini’s uses were not fair.",Computer Program,Fair use not found
Schwartzwald v. Oath Inc.,"No. 19-CV-9938 (RA), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165641 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 10, 2020)",2020,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff Lawrence Schwartzwald took a photograph of actor Jon Hamm walking down the street in which Hamm appears not to be wearing any underwear under his pants (the “Photograph”). Schwartzwald licensed the Photograph to media outlets through his agency. HuffPost.com, a media website owned and operated by Defendant Oath Inc. (“Oath”), published an article titled “25 Things You Wish You Hadn't Learned in 2013 and Must Forget in 2014,” that listed various events and trends, including notable events involving celebrities. One item in the list entitled “Some ad men don't do underwear” discussed the media coverage that “Jon Hamm’s privates” received that year, and was accompanied by a cropped version of the Photograph, with a black box containing the words “Image Loading” over Hamm’s groin. Schwartzwald registered the Photograph in 2017 and brought suit for copyright infringement in 2018. Oath moved to dismiss the complaint, asserting fair use.",Whether using a cropped version of an unlicensed photograph in an online article discussing the attention the photograph had received when it was first published constitutes a fair use.,"The court found that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, favored a finding of fair use. Oath’s use was transformative because unlike the original photograph that illustrated what Jon Hamm looks like walking down the street, Oath’s use “served the dual purpose of mocking both Hamm and those who found the Photograph newsworthy in the first instance.” The court found that the article’s headline “makes clear that the broader purpose of the article is to poke fun at events, trends, or topics that went ‘viral’.” In addition, the play on words in the text box “alludes to both the nature of digital technology and the body part at issue,” further indicating Oath’s intention of mocking the Photograph and larger situation. The court noted that Oath's use was also transformative because, by superimposing a text box over Hamm’s groin, “Oath modified the very portion of the Photograph that made it most valuable or unique in the first instance.” The commercial nature of the use weighed against fair use, but the court gave this limited weight because the use was transformative. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, favored fair use because the court found that the “Photograph is more factual in nature than creative” and it was previously published. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole, weighed in favor of fair use because, by extensively cropping the photo and adding a text box, Oath limited its use to an amount reasonable to serve its purpose of identifying and mocking the viral topic. The fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, similarly weighed in favor of fair use because it was unlikely that the secondary use would function as a substitute for the original given that “Oath’s use of the Photograph obscures its central feature.” Taking the factors together, the court found fair use as a matter of law.",News Reporting; Photograph; Review/Commentary,Fair use found
"Bain v. Film Indep., Inc.","No. CV 18-4126 PA (JEMx), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141859 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 6, 2020)",2020,United States District Court for the Central District of California,"Plaintiff, Robin Bain, owns the copyright for the motion picture Nowhereland, which was also distributed as Girl Lost (the “Film”). Defendant Jessica Cesaro, professionally known as Jessica Haid, was an actor in the Film. After the Film was screened at festivals but before a commercial release, Haid retained Defendant LA Media Works, Corp. (“LA Media”) to edit scenes from the Film to create an acting reel she could use to showcase her skills to casting directors. Haid shared a watermarked version of the Film with LA Media through a Google Drive link. LA Media removed the watermark and produced two versions of the acting reel for Haid, each under 4 minutes long. Most of the approximately 40 clips were under 10 seconds long. One of the reels included a 1 minute and 9 second excerpt from a 2 minute and 37 second scene. Bain sued Haid, LA Media, and Film Independent, Inc. asserting, among other things, copyright infringement. The claims against Film Independent were dismissed and LA Media settled with Bain. On a motion for summary judgment, Haid contended that her use of the excerpts from the Filmin her acting reel qualify as fair use.",Whether an actor’s use of film excerpts that show clips of her performance to create an acting reel for future casting endeavors after the film has aired in festivals but before commercial release is a fair use.,"The court found that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, strongly favored fair use. The court concluded Haid’s reel was transformative because its purpose is to further her career by showcasing her acting abilities to casting directors using “brief portions of selected scenes in a manner that conveys little information about the plot of the film” whereas the Film’s purpose is to tell a story. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, disfavored fair use because the Film is a fictional work “entitled to broad copyright protection” and its release was limited to screening at six film festivals at the time of Haid’s use. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the work as a whole, favored fair use. Haid’s reels each comprise less than 4% of the film’s 95 minute length and 38 of the 40 excerpts used lasted less than 10 seconds. The court noted that the longer excerpt from the 2 minute and 37 second “pivotal scene” of the Film presented a closer question, but concluded that Haid took no more than was necessary for her intended use of conveying her acting range. The fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market or the value of the copyrighted work, also favored fair use. Although Haid hoped to be paid for future acting jobs as a result of this reel, the court found that there was no reasonable probability that distribution of a reel would interfere with the profitability of or market for the Film because the reel and the Film serve different market functions. Considering the factors together, the court found that Haid’s use was fair and granted summary judgment in Haid’s favor on the infringement claims.",Film/Audiovisual,Fair use found
Bell v. Worthington City Sch. Dist.,"No. 2:18-cv-961, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96464 (S.D. Ohio June 2, 2020)",2020,United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio,"Plaintiff Dr. Keith Bell, a sports psychologist, author, professional speaker, and athletic consultant,wrote the book Winning Isn’t Normal (“WIN”). WIN contains a motivational sports passage that begins “Winning isn’t normal.” In addition to WIN book sales, Bell sells WIN-related products and licenses WIN to others to use, display, and perform. Defendant, the Worthington City School District’s Board of Education, employs two basketball coaches, Coach Souder and Coach Luzador, who publicly displayed the “Winning isn’t normal” passage from WIN. Coach Souder read the passage aloud to the basketball team, attributing it to Bell, and hung a verbatim copy in the team’s locker room. Coach Luzador retweeted a near identical copy of the passage on his personal Twitter feed without attribution to Bell. Bell sued the school district (later amending the complaint to name the Board of Education as the defendant instead), as well as a photography service (that quickly settled), and the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.",Whether a school employee publicly displaying a passage from a work in a school locker room and on the employee’s personal social media account are fair uses.,"With three fair use factors weighing in favor of fair use and one factor neutral, the court found the coaches’ uses of WIN were fair use. The first factor, the purpose and character of the use, favored fair use because while the verbatim copying was not transformative, the coaches’ uses were educational because they aimed to teach athletic “lessons in good sportsmanship and fair play.” Additionally, the coaches’ uses were noncommercial because neither the coaches nor the Board of Education profited from displaying the passage. The second factor, the nature of the work, also favored fair use because WIN had been published and the passage had been widely distributed online prior to the coaches’ uses, so Bell’s right to control WIN’s first publication was not affected. Further, WIN was a mix of fact and fiction, which “d[id] not persuade the Court in either direction.” The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, was neutral. Defendant’s copying was minimal in quantity, as the passage is a small portion of the WIN book, but substantial in quality, as the passage is the heart of the WIN book. The fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the work, favored fair use. The court explained that when a use is noncommercial, the burden of demonstrating market harm rests with the copyright holder. At the time of Defendant’s uses, Bell did not hold a separate copyright registration for the passage alone, so the court considered the market harm for the WIN book as a whole. Beyond “conclusory statements” that Defendant’s uses, if widespread, would adversely impact the market for WIN, Bell was unable to present evidence demonstrating a connection between Defendant’s uses and harm to the market for WIN’s book sales or speaking engagements. The court observed Defendant’s uses may actually help the market for Bell’s work by enhancing his reputation.",Textual Work; Educational/Scholarship/Research; Internet/Digitization,Fair use found
Noland v. Janssen,"No. 17-CV-5452, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95454 (S.D.N.Y. June 1, 2020)",2020,United States District Court Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff Cady Noland’s “Log Cabin Façade” is a wooden sculpture resembling a façade of a log cabin. The sculpture was purchased by Defendant Wilhelm Shürmann in 1990 and, with Noland’s authorization, stained and displayed outdoors in Germany. The outdoor display led the sculpture to deteriorate. Shürmann, with the help of Defendant German art gallery KOW, “refurbished” the work in 2010 in Germany by replacing the original, rotted logs with logs shipped from Noland’s original Montana-based supplier. Shürmann then hired Defendant Janssen Art Gallery, owned and operated by Defendant Michael Janssen, to assist with resale of the sculpture. Janssen marketed the work in the U.S. by providing photographs and plans relating to the original and refurbished sculpture to potential buyers. Noland claimed Defendants’ distribution of photographs and plans of the sculpture constituted copyright infringement and the refurbishment and resale violated Noland’s moral rights under the Visual Artists Rights Act. Defendants moved to dismiss Noland’s Third Amended Complaint.","Whether the distribution of photographs of and plans for a sculptural work, in connection with attempts to resell the sculpture constitutes fair use.","The court assumed, but did not decide, that Log Cabin Façade is entitled to copyright protection in ruling that the distribution of photographs and plans of the sculpture in connection with its attempted sale constituted fair use. On the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, the court was persuaded by other courts that have found that disseminating photographs of copyrighted works “to provide information to legitimate purchasers under the first sale doctrine,” rather than for the original artistic purpose of the work, is transformative. Despite Defendants’ commercial interests in re-selling the work, the court found the use of the work was not exploitative in the traditional sense because the transformative purpose of reselling the work was completely different from the purpose of the original sculpture. On the second factor, the nature of the work, the court found the work to be creative, but this weighed only slightly against fair use because the use was transformative. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole, weighed against fair use because the images allegedly depict the whole work; however, the court found the factor has limited significance in the context of seeking a legitimate sale, as a potential buyer would likely expect to see the whole work. Turning to the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, Noland admitted the dissemination of the photographs and plans positively impacted the market for the original work. The court held that whether or not the sale of the sculpture was protected by the first sale doctrine had no bearing on whether the dissemination of the photographs and plans affected the market for the original work. Accordingly, the fourth factor “tip[ped] decidedly toward fair use.” On balance, the transformative nature of the use and lack of adverse market impact outweighed the “relative insubstantiality” of the other two factors.",Photograph; Sculpture,Fair use found
"Walsh v. Townsquare Media, Inc.","No. 19-CV-4958 (VSB), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96090 (S.D.N.Y. June 1, 2020)",2020,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff, Rebecca Fay Walsh, a photographer who licenses her photographs to online and print media, asserted a claim of copyright infringement relating to the unlicensed publication of Walsh’s photograph of rapper Cardi B at New York Fashion Week in an article on the website XXL Mag (“XXL”), which is owned and operated by Defendant Townsquare Media. The article, entitled “Cardi B Partners with Tom Ford for New Lipstick Shade,” mentions the collaboration, but focuses on the ensuing reaction to the announcement by fans of Cardi B and a rival rapper on Instagram. XXL embedded three Instagram posts in the article: (1) a post by the Instagram account tomfordbeauty to advertise the lipstick; (2) a post by Cardi B reproducing the tomfordbeauty post and thanking Ford for the collaboration; and (3) a post by Cardi B containing a composite image of the lipstick next to Walsh’s photograph under a header announcing the lipstick had sold out, the number of “likes” received, and Cardi B’s caption “Sorry :/” (the “Post”). Defendant moved for judgment on the pleadings, asserting a fair use defense.",Whether embedding a social media post containing an unlicensed photograph in an online news article discussing the post is fair use.,"The court found that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, strongly favored a finding of fair use. XXL’s use of the photograph “was for an entirely different purpose than originally intended” because XXL “did not use the Photograph as a generic image of Cardi B to accompany an article about Cardi B,” but rather “published the Post, which incidentally contained the Photograph, because the Post— or put differently, the fact that Cardi B had disseminated the Post—was the very thing the Article was reporting on.” Further, without the embedded Post, the article “would have been nonsensical in appearance as well as potentially impossible, given that the Post is embedded and hyperlinked, rather than inserted as an image.” XXL’s potential profit from advertisements appearing with the article was outweighed by the transformative, news reporting use. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, favored fair use because the Photograph contained both informational and creative elements, rendering the overall creativity “neutral,” and because the work was previously published by Cardi B. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole, also weighed in favor of fair use because there was “no reasonable substitute” for using the actual Instagram post in an article discussing the Instagram post. The fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, also weighed in favor of fair use. Because the Post depicted the Photograph alongside another image and included the Instagram text and tags, it is “implausible” that XXL’s use would compete with Walsh’s licensing business or affect the market value for her photograph. Overall, the court held the use was fair and dismissed the case.",Internet/Digitization; News reporting; Photograph,Fair use found

ICC provides free, read-only access to its codes and licenses its codes and derivative works, such as supplemental training materials and services. Upcodes, Inc., founded by Garrett and Scott Reynolds (collectively “Defendants”), is a start-up company that aims to provide convenient online access to materials used in the architecture, engineering and construction industries, including ICC’s codes. At various times, Defendants posted on its website free verbatim copies of ICC codes that were adopted into law by state or city governments (“I-Codes as Adopted”), and offered paying customers Defendants also make available to paying subscribers versions of ICC codes that depict in redline sections of the model codes that were not adopted into law (“I-Code Redlines”). ICC moved for summary judgment on copyright infringement of forty I-Codes; and Defendants moved for partial summary judgment on their counterclaim for a declaration of noninfringement, asserting the I-Codes are in the public domain as well as defenses of merger, fair use, and collateral estoppel.",Whether it is a fair use to (1) post online free verbatim copies of privately-developed codes that were adopted into law and (2) post online for paying customers copies of those codes that include text that has not been adopted into law.,"Having concluded that the I-Codes as Adopted are likely in the public domain, the court proceeded with a fair use analysis of both the I-Code Redlines and I-Codes as Adopted. The court found the posting of the I-Codes as Adopted was a fair use. The first factor, the purpose and character of the use, weighed heavily in favor of fair use because Defendants’ posting served a transformative purpose of “disseminating enacted laws for public awareness.” The second factor, the nature of the work, also weighed in favor of fair use because the adopted codes are “clearly factual” and posted “in their capacity as laws.” The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, did not weigh against fair use because, although the copying was substantial, “accurate copying” entails posting “ten-tenths of the law.” The fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the work, could weigh against fair use; however, there was no clear evidence of market harm and such harm was unlikely to be determinative “given the combined weight of the other three factors.” In contrast, disputes regarding material issues of fact prevented the court from deciding whether the posting of I-Code Redlines was a fair use. The first factor did not favor either party. Defendants argued that the I-Code Redlines help educate the public; however, the court found the posting of these materials was “debatable” because the ability to view unadopted text was of questionable value and offering these materials “only to paying customers” could “offset any transformative use.” The second factor weighed in favor of fair use “given the Redlines’ predominantly factual quality.” The third factor likely weighed against fair use because Defendants’ purpose could have been accomplished without including the unadopted text.

"Solid Oak Sketches, LLC v. 2K Games, Inc.,","No. 16-CV-724-LTS-SDA, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53287 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2020)",2020,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Defendants, 2K Games, Inc. and Take Two Entertainment, are videogame developers that annually update and release the NBA 2K basketball simulation video game that depicts NBA basketball players, including their tattoos, with realistic renderings. Plaintiff, Solid Oak Sketches, LLC, alleged that Defendants infringed its copyrighted works— five tattoo designs inked on three NBA players— by publicly displaying renderings of these tattoos in multiple versions of the video game. Defendants asserted several counterclaims, including one seeking a declaration that their use of the tattoos was a fair use. After the court denied a motion for judgment on the pleadings, Defendants moved for summary judgment.",Whether inclusion of a tattoo design in a videogame to realistically depict the likeness of an athlete who is inked with that tattoo constitutes fair use.,"The court decided that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, weighed in favor of Defendants. First, the court held that Defendants transformed the tattoos by using them for “general recognizability” of players in the game, rather than the original purpose for which they were created, which was to allow the players to express themselves through body art. Further, due to the reduced size of the tattoos and myriad of other effects, the expressive details of the tattoos were clearly visible only when users were choosing their players and not during the gameplay portion of the game. Moreover, the tattoos constitute an inconsequential portion of the game, appearing on three out of 400 players and comprising only 0.000286% to 0.000431% of total game data. Although the inclusion of the tattoos in a commercial video games is a commercial use, the tattoos are not featured on marketing materials and are incidental to the games’ commercial value. The court determined the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, also favored Defendants because the tattoos were previously published and the designs are more “factual than expressive” because they were based on common motifs or photographs, not uniquely “expressive” or “creative” designs. The court found the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, again favored Defendants despite the tattoos having been copied in their entirety because it was necessary to use the entirety of the tattoos to serve the purpose of accurately depicting the players. Lastly, the court determined the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work, favored Defendants as well. Plaintiff had conceded that the tattoos as featured in the game did not serve as a substitute for use of the tattoos in any other medium. There was also no evidence that there was a market for licensing tattoos for use in video games or other media or that such a market is likely to develop. Weighing the factors together, the court concluded that Defendants established that no reasonable fact finder could conclude their use was not fair use, and granted summary judgment for Defendants.",Computer program; Film/Audiovisual; Painting/Drawing/Graphic.,Fair use found.
"Tresóna Multimedia, LLC v. Burbank High School Vocal Music Ass’n","Nos. 17-56006, 17-56417, 17-56419, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 9128 (9th Cir. Mar. 24, 2020)",2020,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"This suit involves the use of four musical works in two medleys that the music director at Burbank High School, Brett Carroll, commissioned an arranger to create for the school’s competitive show choirs. The choirs performed these medleys at competitions as well as at fundraising events organized by a nonprofit boosters club for the choirs. After these performances, Tresóna, a licensing company that had acquired certain rights in the musical works through a series of assignments, brought copyright infringement claims against Burbank High School, Carroll, and the choir booster club and its parent members. The district court found that Tresóna lacked standing to sue for infringement of three of the songs because it held only nonexclusive licenses for those works. Tresóna’s remaining infringement claim concerned the rearranged use of approximately twenty seconds of the song “Magic” (originally sung by Olivia Newton-John in the movie Xanadu) in the last two minutes of an eighteen-minute medley called “Rainmaker,” an original theatrical work about a “Dust Bowl-era community ravaged by drought.” As to this work, the court granted summary judgment for Defendants on qualified immunity grounds. Tresóna appealed.",Whether a high school choir’s use of a portion of a musical work in a theatrical medley is a fair use.,"The appellate panel affirmed the district court’s conclusion that Tresóna lacked standing to bring an infringement claim as to three of the songs, but found that the ruling in favor of the defendant on qualified immunity grounds “elided the question” of fair use, a question “that begs to be answered.” The court first noted that although “teaching” is one illustrative example of fair use in the preamble to Section 107, a complete analysis of all four factors is required. The court determined that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, strongly weighed in favor of fair use because the use of “Magic” was for educational, and associated nonprofit fundraising, purposes. The arrangement of a portion of the song in a medley of songs as part of a new theatrical work with a different message was also transformative. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, weighed against a finding of fair use because the song was “undoubtedly” creative in nature rather than informational. Regarding the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, the medley used twenty seconds of a four-minute and twenty-two second song. However, the song’s chorus—the “central element”—of the song was repeated several times during the medley. The court stated that despite this repeated use, the arranger “embedded that portion into a larger, transformative choir showpiece that incorporated many other works, and imbued that entire piece with new expression and meaning not contained within any of the individual works.” Thus, the third factor did not weigh against fair use. On the fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, the panel concluded that no one would buy the sheet music for the arranged medley as a substitute for the sheet music of the song. Weighing the factors together, the court held that the use of portions of “Magic” in the medley was fair use. The court also found Tresóna’s fair use argument to be “objectively unreasonable” in holding that Defendants were entitled to attorneys’ fees.",Education/Scholarship/Research; Music,Fair use found
"In re DMCA Subpoena to Reddit, Inc.","No. 19-mc-80005-SK (JD), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37033 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 2, 2020)",2020,United States District Court for the Northern District of California,"In August 2018, a pseudonymous Reddit user, Darkspliver, posted two items on the social media platform: (1) an image from the back of The Watchtower magazine, a publication by Jehovah’s Witnesses, of a solicitation for donations, and (2) a chart summarizing the type of personal information the church collected about their members. In court filings, Darkspilver explained that he posted the materials to spark discussion about the church’s fundraising and data collection practices. Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society of Pennsylvania (“Watch Tower”), the Jehovah’s Witnesses parent organization and publisher of the magazine, sent a DMCA take down notice to Reddit, claiming that the posts infringed its copyrights. Reddit removed the solicitation ad and Darkspilver voluntarily removed the chart. Watch Tower then served a subpoena on Reddit demanding that Reddit reveal the identity of Darkspliver. Reddit moved to quash the subpoena. A magistrate judge decided the case using a First Amendment balancing of harms test applied in anonymous speech cases. He quashed the subpoena with respect to the solicitation ad but enforced it with respect to the chart, with the qualification that Darkspilver’s identity would be disclosed only to the attorneys of record. Darkspilver filed a motion seeking de novo review.",Whether an anonymous user’s posting of an organization’s copyrighted works on a social media website for the purpose of criticizing the organization is a fair use.,"On review, the district court judge found that the case turned on a determination of fair use, not First Amendment law. The court found “no reason to tackle broad online speech issues” when a fair use analysis is sufficient to decide whether the copyright infringement claim should proceed. With respect to the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, the court found that Darkspilver’s use was transformative because he used the copyrighted material for noncommercial commentary on and criticism of the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ fundraising and data collection practices. Regarding the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, the court found that the ad and chart are functional and instructive documents, which weighed in favor of fair use. The court decided that the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, weighed in Darkspilver’s favor because he copied what was “reasonably necessary” from the original work “to make his criticisms and comments understandable.” Under the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work, the court found that Darkspilver’s use did not affect the market for The Watchtower magazine because Watch Tower does not license the works for the purpose of criticism. Further, the chart was not registered with the Copyright Office until after Darkspliver’s use, undercutting any loss of value in this work. Finally, the court rejected Watch Tower’s argument that the uses might have diverted web traffic from its site because “diversion or suppression of demand from criticism is not a cognizable copyright harm.” Looking at all four factors together, the court concluded the uses were fair and granted the motion to quash the subpoena in its entirety.",Review/Commentary,Fair use found
Cambridge University Press v. Becker,"No. 1:08-cv-1425-ODE, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35134 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 2, 2020)",2020,United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia,"Plaintiffs are three academic publishing houses (the “Publishers”). Georgia State University (“GSU”) adopted a program for professors to post unlicensed digital excerpts of Publishers’ works that students could access for courses. Publishers sued GSU for copyright infringement and a nonjury trial was held on 48 works. Initially, the district court found that use of 43 of the 48 works were fair uses because three or more fair use factors favored GSU. On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit reversed and remanded with instructions for the district court to correct its “erroneous application of factors two and three” and its errors in weighing and balancing the four factors. On remand, the district court found fair use with respect to 44 of the 48 works, reversing most of its original fourth-factor findings and considering the Publishers’ licensing rates as part of its third factor analysis. In weighing the factors, the district court assigned arithmetic weights to the four factors: 25% for factor one, 5% for factor two, 30% for factor three, and 40% for factor four, adjusted where the court found a “noteworthy strength or weakness.” On the second appeal, the panel remanded with instructions for the district court to reinstate its original findings that the fourth factor disfavored fair use as to 31 works and “evaluate the four factors qualitatively, not quantitatively.”",Whether a university’s electronic distribution of unlicensed copyrighted works to students is a fair use.,"On remand, the court separately analyzed whether GSU’s use of each of the 48 works at issue was a fair use based on the principles and instructions provided in the two circuit opinions. For all 48 works, the court found the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, favored fair use because, although not transformative and serving the same function as the copyrighted works, the uses were for a nonprofit educational purpose by a nonprofit educational institution. On the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, the court looked at whether a work was primarily factual or “expressive opinion.” For most works, the court found the factor to be neutral, though it disfavored fair use where the author’s opinion and analysis dominated the excerpt. As to the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, the court looked at the overall percentage of the work used, the number of pages used, and whether the portion used constituted the heart of the work. Except where a substantial amount or the heart of the work was taken, the court found this factor favored fair use. For the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work, the court the found permissions revenues earned by the Publishers to be a “useful proxy” to estimate relative licensing demand for the works. The court observed that even if small excerpts are not a substitute for entire books, some uses caused actual damage to permissions revenue for works. Further, if widespread, such uses would cause substantial damage to the market for the works. Applying the circuit’s instructions to holistically evaluate the factors, the court gave the fourth factor “extra weight” and the second factor “insubstantial weight.” For some works, the court further augmented or mitigated the factors. Overall, the court found that the university’s use of 11 of the works was not fair use, while its use of 37 works was fair use.",Education/Scholarship/Research; Internet/Digitization; Textual work,Mixed result

Jan. 6, 2020)",2020,United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts,"Defendant, Kian Andrew Habib, (“Habib”), video recorded portions of live musical performances by Prince Rogers Nelson (“Prince”), and subsequently uploaded five excerpts from these recordings to his YouTube channel. These five recordings contained recognizable portions of six musical compositions that Prince had registered with the U.S. Copyright Office. Habib descriptively titled the videos as “[a]mazing” and “rare” Prince performances and encouraged YouTube users on his page to “subscribe and comment you won’t regret it!”, but did not otherwise comment on or criticize the videos. YouTube removed the videos after receiving takedown notices alleging that the works infringed Prince’s copyrights. Habib responded with counter-notifications claiming that these videos were fair use. After receiving the counter-notifications, Plaintiff, Comerica Bank & Trust (“Comerica”), on behalf of Prince’s estate, sued Habib for copyright infringement and violations of the anti-bootlegging statute. Both parties moved for summary judgment on fair use.",Whether uploading unauthorized audiovisual recordings of live performances of musical compositions constitutes fair use of the compositions.,"The court determined that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, decisively weighed against fair use. First, the court rejected Habib’s argument that he transformed the work by shooting the videos from a specific vantage point while alternating between shots of Prince and the audience. Further, the court found that Habib failed to transform the videos because he did not alter the music in any way. Additionally, the court disagreed with Habib’s contention that his use was noncommercial because he received non-monetary benefits by posting these videos to gain more YouTube subscribers and increase traffic on his channel. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, also weighed against fair use because Prince’s musical compositions were highly creative works that are at the core of copyright protection, even though they had been previously published. The court found the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, also weighed against fair use because Habib captured significant and valuable portions of the six musical compositions, which were essentially the “heart” of the works. Lastly, the court determined the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work, weighed against fair use as well. The court held that Habib’s videos diverted traffic away from Prince’s authorized YouTube channel, which deprived his estate of advertising revenue. Further, the poor quality videos harmed the estate’s interest in protecting and policing the integrity of secondary uses of Prince’s compositions. As all four factors weighed against fair use, the court granted Comerica’s motion and denied Habib’s motion for summary judgment on fair use.",First Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Music,Fair use not found.
Dlugolecki v. Poppel,"CV 18-3905-GW (GJSx), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149404 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 22, 2019)",2019,United States District Court for the Central District of California,"In the 1990s, plaintiff John Dlugolecki (“Dlugolecki”) photographed American actress Meghan Markle while she was a high school student; and these photographs were published in her school yearbooks. Following the announcement of Markle’s engagement to Prince Harry of Great Britain in 2017, defendant American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. (“ABC”) used several of Dlugolecki’s photographs during ABC programs covering news of the engagement. In total, ABC displayed five photographs for a total of forty-nine seconds during eight hours of combined broadcast time. The photographs were also shown in previews and social media promotions for the broadcasts. Dlugolecki brought suit against ABC alleging copyright infringement. ABC moved for summary judgment, arguing its use of the photographs was fair use.",Whether using high school yearbook photographs in news broadcasts for biographical purposes constitutes fair use.,"The first factor, the purpose and character of the use, was described by the court as being “in equipoise.” The court identified that although “news reporting” is mentioned in the preamble to Section 107 of the Copyright Act, this does not mean that any unauthorized use of a work in a news report is given a special “leg up.” While the court found that ABC’s use of the photographs in television news was somewhat transformative because the photographs were created for the purpose of appearing in a yearbook, it was not “considerably, or overwhelmingly” transformative. This slight transformativeness was balanced out by ABC’s “definite commercial purpose or association” in using the photographs. On the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, the court declined to “make any fine distinctions between creative and factual works,” accepting that there was a minimal measure of creativity in the photographs that slightly benefited Dlugolecki. Addressing the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work, the court did not accept ABC’s argument that it only used the amount it needed of the photographs to fulfill its biographical purpose because ABC could have achieved its goals of identifying Markle without using Dlugolecki’s photographs at all. The photographs were not themselves the subject of the broadcasts, nor were they necessary for the programs, so the court concluded that the third factor did not demonstrably favor ABC. Lastly, the court found the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work, favored Dlugolecki. The court found that there was a market for licensing the photographs once Markle’s engagement was announced given our “tabloid-fueled and celebrity-obsessed — and, more particularly, much of the world's British royal family-obsessed — culture,” even if Dlugolecki had not previously licensed the photographs. Weighing the factors together and finding that none of them clearly favored ABC, the court concluded ABC failed to establish its fair use defense and denied the motion.",Ninth Circuit; Photograph; News Reporting; Film/Audiovisual,Preliminary finding; fair use not found
Red Label Music Publ’g v. Chila Prods.,"18 C 7252, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90159 (N.D. Ill. May 30, 2019)",2019,United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois,"Plaintiff Red Label Music Publishing, Inc. (“Red Label”) is a music publisher that owns the copyrights in the words, music, sound recording, and video of the iconic Super Bowl Shuffle, a hip-hop song and music video featuring members of the Chicago Bears recorded en route to their victory in Super Bowl XX. Defendant Chila Productions (“Chila”) produced a biographical documentary, ’85: The Greatest Team in Football History, which featured eight seconds of the Super Bowl Shuffle’s music and 16 separate short clips of the music video, totaling 59 seconds, while discussing the Super Bowl Shuffle’s role in the Chicago Bears’ season. Red Label brought suit against Chila and others involved with the film alleging copyright infringement. Chila moved for judgment on the pleadings, or in the alternative, summary judgment. Red Label moved to strike Chila’s fair use affirmative defense and opposed summary judgment.",Whether using portions of a sound recording and a music video in a documentary constitutes fair use.,"Denying Red Label’s motion to strike, the court assessed the fair use defense. The first factor, the purpose and character of the use, weighed in favor of fair use because Chila did not use the Super Bowl Shuffle for its expressive content or entertainment value, but rather for its factual content to tell a historical narrative. Its presence in the film was “purely descriptive and designed merely to preserve a specific aspect of [Bears] history.” Moreover, although the documentary was produced for commercial gain, the use of the short clips from the Super Bowl Shuffle was “incidental to the larger commercial enterprise of creating a historical video for profit.” On the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, the court noted that the Super Bowl Shuffle falls within the core of the Copyright Act because it is “original, creative, and expressive.” Yet, because the portions of the Super Bowl Shuffle were used to demonstrate historical facts, not the creativity of the original expression, the court found the second factor neutral. Addressing the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, the court noted that Chila used only two percent of the song and seventeen percent of the music video, which was “no more than necessary” to serve as a historical reference point in the commentary. Lastly, the court found the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work, did not weigh in either party’s favor. The court found the plaintiffs demonstrated some licensing market for the clips, but failed to articulate how defendants’ work would harm this market given that “the parties operate in significantly different markets.” Moreover, the portions of the song in the documentary were not a substitute for the original. Weighing the four statutory factors together, the court determined that Chila’s use of the Super Bowl Shuffle was fair and granted Chila’s motion for summary judgment.",Seventh Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Music; Review/Commentary,Fair use found

May 17, 2019)",2019,United States District Court for the Western District of New York,"Plaintiff Boris Shirman is a photographer who recorded interviews with and took photographs of young voters as they prepared to vote in the 2016 presidential election. Shirman compiled the audio recordings of the interviews and corresponding photographs into a video montage organized thematically concerning topics related to the voters’ political involvement. On the eve of the election, Defendant WHEC-TV, LLC (“WHEC”), a TV news broadcaster, aired a story about first-time voters in the upcoming election, which incorporated portions of both the audio and video of Shirman’s video, to which it added voice-over and graphics. Shirman sued for copyright infringement. WHEC filed a motion to dismiss.",Whether a news broadcaster’s repackaging portions of a video montage into a news segment about the same topic is a fair use.,"The court denied WHEC’s motion to dismiss based on its fair use defense. The first fair use factor, the purpose and character of the use, did not favor WHEC. Initially, the court noted that even though the statute’s preamble mentions “news reporting” as a favored category, a news report that “merely repackages or republishes the original” is unlikely to be fair. The court could not conclude that the use was “transformative” as a matter of law. WHEC’s claim that it aired Shirman’s montage to report on “the creation of the video itself” was unpersuasive. In addition, although it did not reject WHEC’s argument that the original work concerned voters’ feelings whereas its reporting concerned issues that were important to new voters, it found that it also found it plausible that the broadcast used Shirman’s video for the same purpose as the original. Also, WHEC’s use was commercial and it “profited” by forgoing licensing fees. On the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, the fact that Shirman’s work was factual and had been previously published weighed in WHEC’s favor, but the court declined to determine this factor conclusively. Considering the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, the court contrasted WHEC’s “strong” argument that it only used a small portion of Shirman’s video in its broadcast with the countervailing fact that a “substantial portion” of WHEC’s broadcast was composed of “repackaged material” from Shirman’s video. The court concluded that this factor was “difficult to fully assess” until the question of whether the use was transformative was answered. The fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work, weighed against a finding of fair use. Shirman licenses his work, so by using it in an “arguably non-transformative manner,” WHEC adversely impacted Shirman’s market. And if this conduct became widespread, “it would ‘destroy’ the market for Shirman’s work.” Weighing the factors together and finding that factual issues remain, at this stage, the court could not conclude that WHEC established its fair use defense, and thus denied the motion to dismiss.",Second Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; News reporting; Photograph; Review/Commentary,Preliminary finding; fair use not found
"Furie v. Infowars, LLC","Case No. CV 18-1830-MWF (JPRx) (C.D. Cal. May 16, 2019)",2019,United States District Court for the Central District of California,"Plaintiff Matt Furie is the creator of Pepe the Frog, a character featured in several comic books since at least 2003. By 2008, the Pepe character had become a meme that was widely shared online. Throughout 2015 and 2016, Pepe was often pictured as or alongside then-presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and other conservative political figures. In 2017, Jon Allen created a Make America Great Again (“MAGA”) poster featuring his own rendering of Pepe alongside Trump and other conservative and “alt-right” figures. Allen offered the MAGA poster to Free Speech Systems, LLC (“FSS”), which is the operating business of right wing media site Infowars, LLC (“Infowars”), to sell on its online stores. Neither FSS, nor Infowars, nor Allen obtained license from Furie to use the image or character of Pepe the Frog. Furie sued FSS and Infowars for copyright infringement.",Whether unlicensed use of a character that has been used frequently in memes constitutes infringement.,"The court applied the Ninth Circuit’s two-step test for determining the first factor of fair use, the purpose and character of the use, which considers whether the use was commercial and transformative. First, the court found that the use of Pepe in the MAGA poster was undoubtedly commercial. Next, the court held there were numerous factual disputes as to whether the use of Pepe in the MAGA poster was transformative, including with respect to the changes that were made to Pepe’s physical appearance and the purpose of Pepe’s inclusion on the poster. Addressing the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, the court rejected the defendants’ arguments that the “meme-ification” of Pepe the Frog destroyed or diminished Furie’s copyright interest in the character. The court noted that no matter how popular a character may become, its copyright owner is still entitled to guard against unauthorized uses. The court held that disputed issues of fact prevented it from ruling on the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used. Likewise, the court found that the parties had raised disputed issues of fact on the fourth fair use factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work. While plaintiff argued that defendants’ use harmed the market for his work by associating it with the alt-right, defendants argued that Pepe’s association with political conservatives increased its popularity. Lastly, the court rejected the defendants’ argument that a controversial defendant should not have his or her fair use defense decided by a jury because of First Amendment protection for political speech. The court denied the defendants’ motion for summary judgment on fair use.",Ninth Circuit; Internet/Digitization; Review/Commentary; Painting/Drawing/Graphic,"Fair use not found, preliminary ruling"
"Brammer v. Violent Hues Productions, LLC","No. 18-1763 (4th Cir. Apr. 26, 2019)",2019,United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,"Plaintiff Russell Brammer is a photographer who shot a time-lapse photograph of the Adams Morgan neighborhood in Washington, D.C. Brammer posted the image on several image-sharing websites and his personal website with the phrase “© All rights reserved” beneath it. Defendant Violent Hues Productions, a film festival organizer, used a cropped version of Brammer’s photograph on its website alongside information about things to do in the D.C. area. After Brammer contacted Violent Hues to request compensation for the unauthorized use, defendant removed the photograph from its website but refused to compensate Brammer. Brammer initiated a copyright infringement action. The district court granted summary judgment to Violent Hues, holding that its use was a fair use. Brammer appealed.",Whether the use of a cropped stock photograph on a film festival website to illustrate a list of nearby tourist attractions is a fair use.,"The court found the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, weighed against fair use because the use was not transformative. Unlike technological or documentary uses that involve contextual change, Violent Hues used the photograph precisely for its content, that is, to depict Adams Morgan. Although Violent Hues claimed that its use provided film festival attendees with “information” regarding Adams Morgan, this use “would not be hindered if it had to comply with Brammer’s copyright.” Further, using the photograph to illustrate a website promoting a for- profit festival without paying for a license was commercial use. In addition, because the defendant, at best, acted negligently, the panel rejected the district court’s finding that Violent Hues’ use was in “good faith.” The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, also weighed against fair use because Brammer’s photograph is a “stylized image, with vivid colors and a bird’s-eye view” infused with “creative choices” that entitle it to “thick” copyright protection. In the court’s view, the fact that the image had previously been published was of “no effect” in the context of photography. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, weighed against fair use because Violent Hues used roughly half the photograph, removing only the negative space and keeping the most expressive features. The fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work, weighed against fair use as well. The court applied a presumption of market harm because Violent Hues’ use was commercial and not transformative. Brammer also introduced evidence showing that he twice licensed the photograph—a licensing market which would be “dampened” if Violent Hues’ conduct were widespread. Considering the four factors together, the court concluded that “the copying here fails the ‘ultimate test’ of fair use: Violent Hues’ online display of Brammer’s photo does not serve the interest of copyright law.” Indeed, while some content “sharing” online may be fair, “[i]f the ordinary commercial use of stock photography constituted fair use, professional photographers would have little financial incentive to produce their work.” Accordingly, the panel reversed and remanded the case.",Fourth Circuit; Photograph; Internet/Digitization,Fair use not found
"Philpot v. WOS, Inc.","No. 1:18-CV-339-RP (W.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2019)",2019,United States District Court for the Western District of Texas,"Plaintiff Larry Philpot is a freelance photographer who attends concerts where he takes photographs—sometimes in exchange for tickets, food, and drinks, but never for monetary compensation. Philpot uploads his photographs to Wikimedia Commons, where they are available for free, subject to a Creative Commons attribution license that requires users to credit him and/or his personal website. Defendant WOS, Inc., a small media company, operates a website focused on country music. WOS published two articles on its website using two of Philpot’s concert photographs featuring musicians discussed in the articles. Both photographs were attributed to “Wikimedia Commons,” and one credited Philpot by his Wikimedia username. Philpot sent WOS a cease-and-desist letter concerning the photograph that did not credit him at all. In response, WOS added Philpot’s username. Philpot brought a copyright infringement action against WOS for its use of both photographs. WOS filed a motion for summary judgment on the issue of fair use.",Whether use of concert photographs available for free under a Creative Commons attribution license in connection with articles about musicians constitutes fair use.,"Concerning the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, the court found the use to be commercial because, despite the limited profitability of WOS’s articles, the photographs were used to generate advertising revenue based on page views. Considering whether the uses were transformative, although a jury could find the uses constitute commentary, the court concluded that a reasonable jury could also find that the works were used for the same purpose. At the summary judgment stage, the court concluded the commerciality and transformativeness analysis favored Philpot. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, also favored Philpot because even though his photographs convey factual information, they also reflect “creative judgments about things like angle, framing, and timing.” On the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, the court distinguished WOS’s use from cases where use of the entire image was necessary because those cases involved commentary on the image or the works were reduced to thumbnails for search. Lastly, the court commented that the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work, presumptively weighed in favor of Philpot because the use was commercial and not transformative. This presumption was rebutted, however, by evidence there is no actual or potential market for Philpot’s photographs because the two works at issue are available for free and Philpot “makes little to no money licensing or selling prints of any of his photos.” While the fourth factor tilted in favor of fair use, the court determined that its weight was not “so great” or fair use “so obvious” that no reasonable jury could find otherwise.

Mar. 18, 2019)",2019,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff Dennis Clark is a photographer who owns a copyrighted photograph depicting a dockless bicycle parked at the edge of a sidewalk, which was featured in a New York Post (“Post”) article under the headline: “Dockless bikes are already clogging NYC sidewalks.” The next day, Defendant Transportation Alternatives (“TransAlt”), a nonprofit transit advocacy organization, used a screenshot of the article in a post on its “Daily Bike Forecast” blog, cropping the screenshot to show only the article’s headline, author byline, and Clark’s photograph and photographer credit. In the post, TransAlt commented that Clark’s photograph actually refutes the article’s proposition because the photograph shows a dockless bicycle that “appears to be parked rather considerately.” Clark brought suit alleging copyright infringement of his photograph. The parties submitted letters concerning a contemplated motion to dismiss by TransAlt, which the court found provided sufficient basis to decide a motion to dismiss without formal briefing.",Whether use of a photograph from a news article in a blog post that discusses the news article constitutes fair use.,"The court found the first factor, purpose and character of the use, weighed in favor of fair use because TransAlt did not reproduce the photograph as a standalone image, but rather as part of a screenshot to satirize the Post’s reporting by showing the “humorous incongruity” of the Post’s headline juxtaposed with Clark’s photograph. The court rejected Clark’s argument that the use was not transformative because the blog post used the photograph to critique the Post’s article rather than the photograph itself. The non-commercial purpose of the use, which was posted on a non-profit organization’s blog, also favored fair use. On the second factor, nature of the copyrighted work, the court noted that the photograph was “a ‘creative’ (rather than ‘factual’) work,” but added that this factor rarely plays a significant role in fair use determinations. Addressing the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, the court found that although reproducing the entire photograph often cuts against fair use, TransAlt’s use of the full photograph was necessary to communicate its point that the photograph “undermined” the view expressed in the Post article. The court rejected Clark’s argument that TransAlt could have used a different photograph, finding that requiring TransAlt to do so would stifle TransAlt’s ability to critique. Lastly, the court found the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work, weighed in favor of fair use because “the Screenshot does not compete against the Photograph in the enterprise of depicting dockless bicycles,” particularly because the screenshot contained text in addition to the photograph. Weighing the four statutory factors together, the court determined that TransAlt's use of the photograph was fair and dismissed Clark’s complaint.",Second Circuit; Photograph; News reporting; Parody/Satire; Review/Commentary,Fair use found
"VHT, Inc. v. Zillow Group","Nos. 17-35587, 17-35588 (9th Cir. Mar. 15, 2019)",2019,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"VHT, the largest professional real estate photography studio in the U.S., licenses its photographs to real estate professionals to market properties. Zillow, an online real estate marketplace, receives real estate photos, including copyrighted photographs owned by VHT, through digital feeds from real-estate sources. VHT brought claims for direct and secondary copyright infringement relating to Zillow’s use of VHT’s photographs on its website. Zillow argued that its use of the photographs on the “Digs” section of its website, which focuses on home improvement and design was a fair use. The “Digs” section of the website consists of certain photographs selected from the listing platform section that Zillow moderators tag with various criteria (room type, style, cost, color) to make them searchable. At summary judgment, the district court rejected Zillow’s fair use defense. The jury was instructed to consider only whether “reproduction, cropping, and scaling” of those photographs by Zillow constituted fair use. The jury returned a verdict for VHT on direct infringement involving the tagged Digs images, and the court denied Zillow’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.",Whether the tagging of photographs to make them searchable on a website is transformative and supports a finding of fair use.,"Among the issues on appeal, Zillow sought review of the district court’s summary judgment decision rejecting Zillow’s fair use defense. The panel affirmed the district court’s finding that Zillow’s use of the photographs to create a searchable database was not a fair use. In analyzing the first factor, purpose and character of the use, the panel distinguished this case from other “search engine” cases, in which the display of thumbnail images and snippets of works were found to be fair uses. The court concluded that “search engine” is not a “talismanic term” and that a fair use determination requires “considering the details and function of a website’s operation.” In contrast to internet-wide search engines that direct to the original source of photos or use thumbnail images, Zillow only included photographs from its own database and used full-size versions of the photographs for the same purpose as the originals, that is, “to artfully depict rooms and properties.” Overall, the panel found Zillow’s “lack of transformation” disfavored fair use. The second factor, nature of the copyrighted work, also slightly disfavored fair use because the photos were “aesthetically and creatively shot and edited,” though the court held their prior publication diminished the force of this factor. The third factor, amount and substantiality of the portion used, disfavored fair use because the full image was used and, unlike in other search engine cases, the court found nothing in Zillow’s use to justify that as necessary. The fourth factor, effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the original, also disfavored fair use because VHT was exploring licensing opportunities. Ultimately, the court concluded the four factors cut against fair use and upheld the district court’s grant of summary judgment rejecting that defense.",Ninth Circuit; Photograph,Fair use not found
Peterman v. Republican National Committee,"No. CV 17-66-M-DLC (D. Mont. Feb. 22, 2019)",2019,United States District Court for the District of Montana,"Plaintiff Erika Peterman, a photographer, was hired and paid a $500 fee by the Montana Democratic Party (“MDP”) to take photographs of Democratic candidate and singer-songwriter Rob Quist at an event. Peterman granted an unrestricted royalty-free license to the MDP and Quist campaign to use the resulting photographs. Both the MDP and Quist campaign subsequently posted one photograph (the “Work”) to Facebook without attribution or copyright information. Peterman later learned that the Republican National Committee (“RNC”) had sent out a mailer in support of Quist’s opponent that used the Work to negatively depict Quist. The RNC mailer was prepared by a vendor who downloaded the Work from the Quist campaign’s Facebook page, photoshopped it, and added a treble clef and text reading “For Montana Conservatives, / Liberal Rob Quist / Can’t Hit the Right Note.” The court denied the RNC’s motion to dismiss Peterman’s copyright claim because disputed issues of material fact remained as to whether the RNC’s use was a fair use.",Whether use of a copyrighted photograph by a political party in a mailer to criticize an opponent is a fair use.,"On cross-motions for summary judgment, the court found that the balance of factors favored fair use. On the first factor, purpose and character of the use, the court found the vendor’s two “minimal alterations” to the Work alone were insufficiently transformative. Yet, by “us[ing] Quint’s musicianship to criticize his candidacy,” the mailer “changed the function and meaning of the Work by connoting a critical message not inherent in the Work itself.” This purpose, along with the noncommercial nature of the mailer, favored fair use. The court rejected the RNC’s First Amendment argument, commenting that First Amendment principles are incorporated into the fair use factors and the First Amendment “does not present an additional layer of protection for unauthorized uses.” On the second factor, nature of the copyrighted work, the court changed its analysis from its opinion on the motion to dismiss from weighing against fair use to “inconclusive” in light of additional facts that the Work had been published and shared by the MDP, Quist campaign, and Peterman, despite the Work being “unequivocally creative.” The third factor, amount and substantiality of the portion used, weighed against fair use because “the RNC copied essentially the entirety of the Work” and “could have made its point as effectively without incorporating the Work into its mailer.” Finally, the court concluded that the fourth factor, effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the original, favored fair use because “[t]he Work has no recognizable value outside of the . . . campaign, and that value has been fully realized by Peterman,” who had been paid by the MDP. The first and fourth factors being “determinative” in this case, the court granted summary judgment for the RNC on its fair use defense.","Ninth Circuit, Photograph, Review/Commentary",Fair use found
"Capitol Records, LLC v. ReDigi Inc.","No. 16-2321 (2nd Cir. Dec. 12, 2018)",2018,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiffs, record companies Capitol Records, LLC, Capitol Christian Music Group, Inc., and Virgin Records IR Holdings, Inc., own copyrights or licenses in sound recordings of musical performances. Defendant ReDigi is an Internet platform intended to create a legal marketplace for the resale of digital music files. To be able to sell a music file, a user must download and install ReDigi’s “Music Manager” software program, which verifies that the file was lawfully purchased. ReDigi’s transfer process, which it described as “data migration,” then breaks the music file into small blocks, which are transferred to ReDigi’s server such that the file never exists simultaneously on the user’s device and the receiving device. A user may then resell the file using ReDigi’s market function, and the purchaser may either download or stream the file. Plaintiffs filed a copyright infringement claim against ReDigi, alleging that ReDigi made unauthorized reproductions and distributions of Plaintiffs’ copyrighted works. After the district court entered a stipulated final judgment awarding Plaintiffs $3,500,000 in damages and enjoining the operation of ReDigi, Defendants appealed.",Whether an online platform’s reproduction of digital music files that had been purchased legally for the purpose of resale is a fair use.,"The Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s determination on the question of reproduction, holding that even if the digital files ReDigi creates in the data migration process qualify as phonorecords, which could potentially make them eligible for protection under the first sale doctrine as codified in 17 US.C. § 109(a), ReDigi’s process involved the unauthorized reproduction of the music file, which “violated the rights holder’s exclusive reproduction rights under § 106(1).” The court then held that ReDigi’s reproduction of music files was not a fair use. The court found that the first factor, purpose and character of the use, weighed in favor of Plaintiffs. It reasoned that ReDigi does not change or add to the copyrighted work; rather, ReDigi “provide[s] a market for the resale of digital music files, which resales compete with sales of the same recorded music by the rights holder.” ReDigi’s commercial nature also weighed against finding a fair use. The second factor, nature of the copyrighted work, was neutral. The third factor, amount and substantiality of the portion used, weighed in favor of Plaintiffs because ReDigi makes reproductions of the entire copyrighted sound recordings. The final factor, effect of the use upon the potential market, also weighed in favor of Plaintiffs. Because “ReDigi’s replicas were sold to the same consumers whose objective in purchasing was to acquire Plaintiffs’ music” at a lower price, the court found that the last factor “weighs powerfully against fair use.” Balancing the factors, the court focused on “the substantial harm ReDigi inflicts on the value of Plaintiffs’ copyrights through its direct competition in the rights holders’ legitimate market.” Thus, the Second Circuit concluded that ReDigi’s reproduction of music files for the purpose of resale was not a fair use.","Second Circuit, Internet/Digitization, Music",Fair use not found
"Otto v. Hearst Communications, Inc.","No. 1:17-cv-4712-GHW (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 10, 2018)",2018,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff Jonathan Otto attended a friend’s wedding at the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey in June 2017. President Donald Trump surprised the celebrants when he stopped by the wedding unannounced. Otto took a picture on his iPhone of President Trump at the wedding. Otto texted the picture to another wedding guest. The next day, Otto learned that his photograph had been published by multiple media outlets, including Defendant Hearst Communications, which had published Otto’s photograph as part of an article about the wedding on Esquire.com. It does not cost money to access Esquire.com, but the page displaying the article about the wedding featured ads from which Hearst earned revenue.",Whether a news organization’s unauthorized publication of a photograph in connection with an article about the U.S. President is a fair use.,"The district court granted Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment on Defendant’s fair use defense. The court found that the first factor, purpose and character of the use, weighed in favor of Plaintiff. It reasoned that Hearst’s use was not transformative because Otto took the photograph and Hearst used the photograph for the same purpose: to show a noteworthy event. Although the court recognized that in an “extraordinary case,” the public interest in news reporting justify reproduction of an original work without significant alteration, it found that this was not such a case. The court also determined that Defendant’s use was commercial, which weighed against finding a fair use, because Hearst received advertising revenue from the article. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, favored Hearst. Because Otto did not stage or pose the photograph, the court concluded that the photograph was “more factual than creative.” The photograph had also been widely disseminated prior to Hearst’s use, which weighed in favor of Heart. The third factor, amount and substantiality of the portion used, weighed in favor of Plaintiff, because “Hearst used a slightly cropped but otherwise unedited version of Otto’s photograph.” The court rejected Defendant’s argument that the news reporting purpose of the use required Hearst to use the complete photograph. The final factor, effect of the use upon the potential market, also weighed in favor of Plaintiff. The court observed that “[p]ublishing the [p]hotograph without permission essentially destroy[ed] the primary market for its use.” Although he was not a professional photographer, “Otto had the right to try to sell the [p]hotograph to media outlets, if he decided to do so.” Hearst’s use of a nearly identical version of Otto’s photograph supplanted Otto’s market. Weighing the factors together, the court concluded that Hearst’s publication of Otto’s photograph was not fair use as a matter of law.","Second Circuit, Internet/Digitization, News reporting, Photograph",Fair use not found
Cambridge University Press v. Albert,"No. 16-15726 (11th Cir. Oct. 19, 2018)",2018,United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit,"Plaintiffs are three academic publishing houses (the “Publishers”). Georgia State University (the “University”) provides students with digital excerpts of Plaintiffs’ works without payment. Plaintiffs filed a copyright infringement claim against the University. Initially, the district court held that the University had infringed Plaintiffs’ copyrights but found that, in 43 of the 48 instances at issue, the University’s use was fair. It found that the fair use defense applied whenever three or more factors favored the University. In the event of a tie, the court reconsidered the weight of certain factors. On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit reversed, vacated, and remanded, with instructions for the district court to “correct its ‘erroneous application of factors two and three’ and its errors in ‘[weighing and] balancing the four fair use factors’” in its analysis of the fair use defense. On remand, the district court found fair use in 44 of the 48 instances, reversing most of its original fourth- factor findings and considering the rates the Publishers charged as part of its third factor analysis. In weighing the factors, the district court assigned “initial, approximate respective weights of the four factors as follows: 25% for factor one, 5% for factor two, 30% for factor three, and 40% for factor four,” which it adjusted if it found a “noteworthy strength or weakness.” Plaintiffs again appealed.",Whether a university’s electronic distribution of unlicensed copyrighted works to students is a fair use.,"The Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court’s fair use determination and remanded for further proceedings. The Eleventh Circuit discussed only the third and fourth fair use factors and the method of balancing the fair use factors. Regarding the fourth factor, effect of the use upon the potential market, the Eleventh Circuit held that its previous decision had not found any error in the district court’s analysis, because the district court had correctly focused on the “central question” of whether a use “would cause substantial economic harm such that allowing it would frustrate the purposes of copyright by materially impairing [the publishers’] incentive to publish the work.” That holding precluded the district court from revisiting the fourth factor, and thus the district court must “reinstate its original findings that the fourth factor strongly disfavors fair use for the 31 excerpts for which the publishers proved the availability of digital licenses.” The Eleventh Circuit rejected the district court’s determination that the high prices the Publishers charged for licenses justified the University’s use of more of the content than may otherwise be considered fair use. The Eleventh Circuit held that the third factor considers only the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyright work as a whole, and “does not direct courts to consider the price of the unpaid use.” Finally, the court instructed the district court to “break free of its erroneous ‘arithmetic approach’ [in balancing the four factors as to each excerpt] and to give each excerpt the holistic review the Act demands.” The decision specified that “the district court must not apply a mathematical formula at any step of its analysis.”","Eleventh Circuit, Internet/Digitization, Textual work","Preliminary ruling, remand"
Ferdman v. CBS Interactive Inc.,"No. 17 Civ. 1317 (PGG) (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2018)",2018,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff Steven Ferdman is a photographer who licenses his photographs to publishers for a fee. GameSpot, an online publication of Defendant CBS Interactive Inc., features information about video games and related entertainment. While the movie Spider-Man: Homecoming was being filmed, Ferdman took photographs of the production, including of the actor Tom Holland. Ferdman uploaded the photographs to a licensing service. Around that same time, GameSpot published two articles about the movie, each featuring at least one photograph taken by Plaintiff. The first article included a photograph of Holland that was taken by Plaintiff and that Holland had posted to his Instagram account (“Holland Photograph”). The second article featured a gallery of images, including seven of Plaintiff’s photographs, which GameSpot claimed it believed “had been made available for use by the media” (“Gallery Photographs”).",Whether a website’s use of copyrighted photographs in online articles is a fair use.,"The District Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment on Defendant’s fair use defense as to the Gallery Photographs. The court concluded that the first factor, purpose and character of the use, weighed in favor of Ferdman. The court rejected Defendant’s argument that its use was transformative because the photographs were used for news reporting and commenting, holding that, rather than providing new information or insight, the intention of the news article was “simply [to show] that the photographs exist.” On the Holland photograph, the court concluded that the use may have been “somewhat transformative” because GameSpot “injected some ‘new meaning or message’ into the photograph by reporting that the actor himself had posted the photograph and had provided commentary on it,” but was not so transformative to constitute fair use as a matter of law. Relatedly, the court also found that Defendant’s status as a for-profit entity weighed against a finding of fair use but was not dispositive. The second factor, nature of the copyrighted work, supported a fair use finding. Plaintiff was merely “photographing the events around him as they occurred.” The court also noted that the photographs had been published at the time of Defendant’s use. The third factor, amount and substantiality of the portion used, was neutral. The court noted that a photograph is inherently harder to excerpt than other types of works. The final factor, effect of the use upon the potential market, weighed against fair use. With respect to both categories of photographs, “Defendant’s use of the photographs in its articles is a clear substitute for the market use of Plaintiff’s photographs.” Balancing the factors, the court held that “fair use is unavailable as a matter of law” as to the Gallery Photographs. With respect to the Holland Photograph, the court held that material questions of fact exist with respect to whether the use was transformative, which could potentially tip the balance of factors toward a finding of fair use.","Second Circuit, Photograph, Review/Commentary, Internet/Digitization, News reporting","Preliminary ruling, fair use not found, mixed result"
Davidson v. United States,"No. 13-942C (Fed. Cl. June 29, 2018)",2018,United States Court of Federal Claims,"Plaintiff Robert Davidson is the sculptor of a Statue of Liberty replica (the “Work”), located at the New York–New York Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. Davidson’s replica was not exact; in particular, he described the face of his Lady Liberty as “softer” and “more contemporary.” The United States Postal Service (“USPS”) used a photograph of Davidson’s statue on a stamp without having received permission to do so or giving attribution to Davidson. Indeed, the USPS at that time did not know the photograph was of a replica. The photograph was from Getty Images, to which the USPS paid a license fee to use the photograph. Getty Images, however, did not own the rights to the underlying subject depicted in the photograph. Davidson brought a copyright infringement claim against the United States, acting through USPS, to recover damages under 28 U.S.C. § 1498(b).",Whether the government’s use of a photograph of a copyrighted work on a stamp is fair.,"The court determined that the government’s use of a photograph of the Work was not fair. The court concluded that the first factor, purpose and character of the infringing work, weighed in favor of Davidson. The court found that the use was commercial: the particular photograph was chosen in large part based on “the attractiveness of the image” in hopes of achieving “higher sales.” The second factor, nature of the copyrighted work, was neutral. While “the original elements of plaintiff’s statue were creative and expressive, its intended use as a replica mitigates in favor of defendant.” Moreover, the Work had been on public display, which indicates that a use is more likely to be fair. The third factor, amount and substantiality of the portion used, weighed against a finding of fair use. The photograph used on the stamp, in focusing on the face of the statue, highlighted “[t]he original and expressive portion of plaintiff’s statue.” The final factor, effect of the use upon the potential market, weighed in favor of fair use. Davidson conceded that this factor favored the government, since he “could cite no harm to [his] business from the Postal Service’s use, and he has shown no other interest in exploiting the work.” Weighing the factors together, the court concluded that the fact the USPS “print[ed] billions of copies and s[old] them to the public as part of a business enterprise…overwhelmingly favor[ed] a finding of infringement.” Even after the USPS realized its error, it “offered neither public attribution nor apology.” The court, therefore, found that the government’s use of the photograph featuring Davidson’s statue was not fair.","Federal Circuit, Sculpture, Photograph",Fair use not found

LLC (collectively, “Lucasfilm”) own the copyrights covering at least three Star Wars works (the “Works”). Defendants Ren Ventures and Sabacc Creative Industries Ltd. are the creators and distributors of “Sabacc – The High Stakes Card Game,” a mobile game app. The game allegedly mimics one that appears in Star Wars. To promote the app on Facebook and Twitter, defendants utilized dialogue and images from Lucasfilm’s Works. Lucasfilm sent a cease-and-desist letter to defendants, after which Lucasfilm filed a complaint alleging copyright infringement, trademark infringements, and two other claims. Lucasfilm moved for summary judgment on its copyright claim.",Whether the use of copyrighted dialogue and images to promote an app is fair.,"The court determined that defendants’ use of the Works was not fair. The court concluded that the first factor, purpose and character of the infringing work, weighed in favor of Lucasfilm. Because defendants “merely reposted images and dialogue from original works” with only some minor alterations or additions, the use was not transformative. Moreover, in posting the Works to promote their app, defendants’ use was commercial. The second factor, nature of the copyrighted work, favored defendants. While the Works are expressive, they have also been “published extensively,” since images, illustrations, and similar quotes appear at numerous locations online. The court observed: “As a result [of the publication of the Works], the authors have likely realized their expressive and economic interests to a great extent.” The third factor, amount and substantiality of the portion used, weighed for a finding of fair use, because defendants used clips only seconds long. In comparison to the Works, these clips “are quantitatively insignificant.” The final factor, effect of the use upon the potential market, weighed against fair use. The court found “these GIF images can . . . have an adverse effect on the derivative market.” The court determined that because defendants use was non-transformative and commercial, it could presume the likelihood of market harm. The court concluded that since defendants did not “produce[] evidence to show lack of market harm to Lucasfilm from their unlicensed use, this factor weighs against fair use.” Weighing the factors, the court heavily considered “the more important first and fourth factors” and concluded that defendants’ use was not fair. Therefore, the court granted Lucasfilm’s motion for summary judgment on its claim of copyright infringement.","Ninth Circuit, Film/Audiovisual, Internet/Digitization, Review/Commentary",Fair use not found

The owner of Violent Hues contends that he did not know the photograph was copyrighted. Brammer sent a demand letter to Violent Hues, after which Violent Hues removed the photograph from its website. Brammer then filed a complaint alleging copyright infringement and removal and alteration of copyright management information. Violent Hues moved for summary judgment, alleging its use was fair.",Whether the use of a cropped version of a copyrighted photograph on a film festival website is fair.,"The court determined that Violent Hues’ use of Brammer’s photograph was fair. The court concluded that the first factor, purpose and character of the infringing work, weighed in favor of Violent Hues, since its use was transformative and non- commercial. The court observed that “Brammer’s purpose in capturing and publishing the photograph was promotional and expressive,” while “Violent Hues’ purpose in using the photograph was informational.” Moreover, the court explained, Violent Hues used the photograph in good faith, since its owner argued he did not know it was copyrighted. The second factor, nature of the copyrighted work, favored Violent Hues, because it “used the photo purely for its factual content,” and the work had been previously published. The third factor, amount and substantiality of the portion used, weighed for a finding of fair use, because Violent Hues cropped the photograph such that it “used no more of the photo than necessary to convey the photo’s factual content.” The final factor, effect of the use upon the potential market, weighed in favor of fair use. The court found “no evidence that Violent Hues’ use has had an adverse effect on the market for the photograph”; in fact, the court observed that Brammer was compensated for his photograph by other users after Violent Hues included the photograph on its website, “demonstrating that Violent Hues’ use did not affect the market for the photo.” Moreover, the court observed that Brammer “currently makes no effort to market the photo.” Weighing the factors, the court found that Violent Hues’ use was fair and granted summary judgment in its favor.","Fourth Circuit, Photograph, Internet/Digitization",Fair use found
Erika Peterman v. Republican National Committee,"No. 17-66-M-DLC (D. Mont.

Two months later, Peterman was informed that the Republican National Committee (“RNC”), a U.S. political organization responsible for developing and promoting the Republican political platform, had sent out a mass direct mailing, using one of her photographs of Quist (“Work”), that was designed to negatively depict him. Peterman filed a complaint alleging copyright infringement and intentional interference with economic advantage based on RNC’s copying, using, and distributing her photograph. RNC filed a motion to dismiss, alleging its use was a fair use.",Whether use of a copyrighted photograph by a political party for a political mailing is a fair use.,"The court determined that RNC’s use of Peterman’s photograph could not, at the motion to dismiss stage, be found fair. The court concluded that the first factor, purpose and character of the infringing work, “d[id] not favor a finding of fair use at this stage since the Work’s purpose remains a disputed issue of fact and RNC’s use was, at best, minimally transformative.” Indeed, “absent the inclusion of a treble clef attached to the commentary, the entirety of the visual aspects of the Work remain unaltered in RNC’s use.” The second factor, nature of the copyrighted work, “weigh[ed] against a finding of fair use” because the Work “includes elements in its framing that are not factual in nature,” and rather “creatively and visually develops a portrait of Quist and his candidacy.” The third factor, amount and substantiality of the portion used, “weigh[ed] against a finding of fair use” because RNC “copied the entirety of Peterman’s Work quantitatively and qualitatively for use in its political mailers.” The final factor, effect of the use upon the potential market, could not be assessed because it “remains a disputed issue of fact;” “it is uncertain whether the use of the Work in a political mailing criticizing Quist is likely to diminish the potential sale of the Work, interfere with the marketability of the Work, or fulfill the demand for the Work.” Weighing the factors, and resolving all issues in favor of Peterman, the court found that “disputed issues of material fact remain on whether RNC’s use of Peterman’s Work constituted a fair use.” The court thus denied RNC’s motion to dismiss the copyright infringement claim.","Ninth Circuit, Photograph, Review/Commentary","Preliminary ruling, Fair use not found"
Oyewole v. Ora,"291 F. Supp. 3d 422 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 8, 2018)",2018,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff Abiodun Oyewole (“Oyewole”), a founding member of the spoken-word group The Last Poets, wrote the song “When the Revolution Comes” in 1968. According to Oyewole, the song includes repeated uses of the phrase “party and bulls**t” to “challenge[] and encourage[] people to not waste time with ‘party and bulls**t,’ but to move towards success.” Decades later, two recording artists— Christopher Wallace a.k.a. “The Notorious B.I.G.” and Rita Ora—separately released two songs (entitled “Party and Bullshit” and “Party,” respectively) that repeat the phrase “party and bulls**t” in lyrics that celebrate self-indulgence. Oyewole brought suit against Wallace, Ora, and composers, producers, publishers, and distributors associated with the songs (collectively, “Defendants”), alleging copyright infringement. Specifically, Oyewole claimed Defendants appropriated and exploited the punchline, performance, lyrics, poem, rhythmic line and text of his original song. Defendants moved to dismiss on several grounds, including that their use of the phrase “party and bullshit” was fair use.",Whether using an existing lyrical phrase/pattern in a new song without permission constitutes fair use.,"The court assumed Oyewole was the owner of the copyright in When the Revolution Comes, the phrase “party and bulls**t” was a protectable expression, and the works were substantially similar. In assessing the fair use defense, the court decided that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, strongly weighed in favor of fair use. Although Defendants’ songs clearly had a commercial purpose, the court held that Defendants’ songs transformed the purpose of the “party and bulls**t” phrase from “one of condemnation to one of glorification.” On the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, the court observed that Oyewole’s song was creative, which weighed against fair use, but also that it was published, which favored fair use. Addressing the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work, the court commented that whereas Defendants’ songs repeat the phrase multiple times, it was only one phrase from the end of Oyewole’s song and “not critically important to the song’s message.” Lastly, the court found the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work, favored fair use because the songs appeal to different target audiences and are so dissimilar in character that Defendants’ songs do not “provid[e] the public with a substitute” for Oyewole’s work. Weighing the factors together, the court concluded Defendants’ uses were fair uses and granted the Defendants’ motion to dismiss.

(“TVEyes”) is a media company that records the content of more than 1,400 TV and radio channels, imports that content into a database, and permits its clients, for a $500 monthly fee, to view, archive, download, and share with others TV clips of up to ten minutes in length. Plaintiff Fox News Network, LLC (“Fox”) owns content that TVEyes recorded and provided to its clients; it sued TVEyes for copyright infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The district court held that some of TVEyes’s functions constitute a fair use, including the functions that enabled clients to search videos by term, to watch the resulting videos, and to archive the videos on the TVEyes servers. But the court also held that some functions were not a fair use, including those enabling clients to download videos to their computers, to e-mail the videos to others, or to watch videos after searching for them by date, time, and channel, rather than by keyword. The district court thus dismissed Fox’s challenge to several functions of the TVEyes service, but Fox won a permanent injunction with respect to those functions the court held not to be fair use. In its appeal, Fox challenged the district court’s finding that the “Watch” function was a fair use, though did not challenge the court’s finding with respect to the “Search” function.",Whether TVEyes’s redistribution of Fox’s content constitutes a fair use.,"After conducting the four-step analysis, the court found that TVEyes’s Watch function was not a fair use; this holding, according to the court, “subsumes and obviates consideration of certain functions that are subsidiary to the Watch function, such as archiving, downloading, and emailing the video clips.” The court concluded that the first factor, purpose and character of the infringing work, “favor[ed] TVEyes, albeit slightly,” because the “Watch function is at least somewhat transformative” in that it permits clients to “view the Fox programming they want at a time and place that is convenient to them.” The fact that the use is commercial did not entirely outweigh its transformativeness. The second factor, nature of the copyrighted work, “play[ed] no significant role here.” The third factor, amount and substantiality of the portion used, weighed against fair use because “TVEyes makes available virtually the entirety of the Fox programming that TVEyes users want to see and hear,” which makes TVEyes “radically dissimilar to the service at issue” in Authors Guild v. Google; “TVEyes’s use of Fox’s content is therefore both extensive and inclusive of all that is important from the copyrighted work.” The final factor, effect of the use upon the potential market, weighed against fair use because “there is a plausibly exploitable market for such access to televised content,” and “[t]he success of the TVEyes business model demonstrates that deep-pocketed consumers are willing to pay well for a service that allows them to search for and view selected television clips.” The court noted that, “[b]y providing Fox’s content to TVEyes clients without payment to Fox, TVEyes is in effect depriving Fox of licensing revenues from TVEyes or from similar entities.” Weighed together, the court concluded “that TVEyes’s service is not justifiable as a fair use.” The court remanded to the district court to revise its permanent injunction accordingly.","Second Circuit, Internet/Digitization, Film/Audiovisual",Fair use not found
Philpot v. Media Research Center Inc.,"No. 1:17-cv-822 (E.D. Va. Jan. 8, 2018)",2018,United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia,"Plaintiff Larry Philpot is a professional photographer who takes photographs of musicians in concert. Defendant Media Research Center is a non-profit organization that “publishes news and commentary regarding issues of public debate in order to expose and critique media bias against American Judeo-Christian beliefs.” This case involves Plaintiff’s copyright interests in two photographs: (1) a photograph of Kenny Chesney performing in concert, and (2) a photograph of Kid Rock performing in concert. Plaintiff uploaded the photographs to Wikimedia, where they were available for use, subject to a Creative Commons attribution license. Defendant used the Chesney photograph in an article about pro-life celebrities and the Kid Rock photograph in an article about his bid for Senate, without attributing either photograph to Plaintiff. Plaintiff brought a copyright infringement action against Defendant, who filed a motion for summary judgment, in relevant part arguing that its use of the photographs was fair.",Whether Defendant’s use of plaintiff’s photographs of musicians in articles concerning the musicians’ political beliefs constitute fair use of the photographs.,"After conducting the four-step analysis, the court concluded that Defendant’s use of the photographs constituted fair use and granted the Defendant’s motion for summary judgment. As to the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, the court found the use of the photographs was transformative since “[D]efendant’s use of the [p]hotographs [in the articles] is plainly different from [P]laintiff’s intended use of the [p]hotographs.” Defendant used the photographs “for the purposes of news reporting and commentary,” compared with Plaintiff’s intent to “depict the musicians in concert.” The court also found that the use of the photographs was essentially non- commercial since Defendant received only minor amounts of revenue and donations from the articles. With regard to the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, the court found that the factor was neutral since the photographs “are likely both factual and creative” in that they depict celebrities but Plaintiff made creative choices in taking the photographs. As to the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the use, the court found that “[D]efendant used all of [the] Chesney Photograph and only slightly cropped [P]laintiff’s photograph of Kid Rock.” Therefore, this factor favored Plaintiff. Lastly, the fourth factor, the effect on the potential market for the copyrighted work, weighed in favor of the Defendants, because “there is no showing on this record of any impact on any economic market for the Chesney or Kid Rock [p]hotographs.” Thus, the court held the use was fair.",Fourth Circuit; Photograph; Review/Commentary; Internet/Digitization,Fair use found
"Barcroft Media, Ltd. V. Coed Media Group, LLC","No. 16-CV-7634 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 2017)",2017,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiffs Barcroft Media, Ltd. (“Barcroft”) and FameFlynet, Inc. (“FameFlynet”) are purveyors of entertainment-related journalism and own copyrights in celebrity and human- interest photographs. Defendant Coed Media Group (“CMG"") runs celebrity gossip and entertainment websites, and displayed twelve of Plaintiffs’ images on its sites without taking any licenses. The images depict actresses like Salma Hayek and Amanda Bynes, and singers like Selena Gomez, as well as several non-celebrity subjects. Some of the images were cropped, or were thumbnails, or had text and/or CMG’s logo superimposed on them. Plaintiffs sent a cease-and-desist letter, and thereafter the parties attempted to negotiate a subscription fee whereby CMG could use Plaintiffs’ images. A year after those negotiations broke down, and after CMG deleted the images from its site, Plaintiffs filed suit for copyright infringement; CMG claimed that Plaintiffs waived most of their infringement claims, and that displaying the images was fair use. The court held a bench trial.",Whether CMG’s use of celebrity and human-interest photographs on its entertainment and celebrity websites constituted fair use.,"The court determined that Plaintiffs did not waive their claims, and after conducting the four-step analysis, the court found that CMG’s use of the photographs was not fair. As to waiver, a statement by Plaintiffs’ representative “not to worry” about the images in the cease-and-desist letter could not constitute knowing waiver where license negotiations continued after the comments. As to fair use, the court concluded that the first factor, purpose and character of the infringing work, “cut[] strongly against CMG” because “it displayed the Images in the same manner and for the same purpose as they were originally intended to be used,” and thus were not transformative. The court held that the use was not transformative criticism or commentary because CMG’s articles “did not comment on, criticize, or report news about the images themselves; instead, they used the Images as illustrative aids because they depicted the subjects described in its articles.” The court also noted “the commercial nature of CMG’s use.” The second factor, nature of the copyrighted work, “cut[] slightly in CMG’s favor” because the photographs “are essentially factual in nature.” The third factor, amount and substantiality of the portion used, weighed against fair use because CMG “used all or most of each original Image in its website displays.” The final factor, effect of the use upon the potential market, weighed against fair use because “CMG displayed the Images for the very purpose for which they were originally intended,” and thus the use “usurped the function of the original works in the market.” Further, “if CMG’s practice of using celebrity and human interest photographs without licensing were to become widespread, it is intuitive that the market for such images would diminish correspondingly.” Thus, the court concluded that CMG’s use of the photographs was not fair, and granted Plaintiffs a final injunction and damages.","Second Circuit, Internet/Digitization, Photograph, Review/Commentary",Fair use not found
"James Castle Collection and Archive, LP v. Scholastic, Inc. and Allen Say","No. 1:17-CV-00437-BLW (D. Idaho Oct. 30, 2017)",2017,United States District Court for the District of Idaho,"Plaintiff James Castle Collection and Archive, LP is the exclusive owner of all copyrights to the relevant works of renowned Idahoan artist James Castle. Defendant Allen Say wrote and illustrated a children’s book on Castle’s life, which Scholastic, Inc. published. The book is an “imagined biography,” written from the perspective of Castle’s fictional nephew, and includes approximately 150 illustrations, all drawn by Say. About 28 of those illustrations are imitations of Castle’s works by Say, “while the other illustrations are Say’s own depictions of various events in Castle’s life, drawn in a style similar to that of Castle.” After the book was distributed to book sellers, but before it was released to the public, Plaintiff sued Scholastic and Say for copyright infringement and moved for entry of a temporary restraining order to prevent the sale and distribution of the book.",Whether the unauthorized copying of artwork for use in a fictional biography of the original artist constitutes a fair use.,"After conducting the four-step analysis, the court concluded that Defendants were likely to prevail on a fair use defense and thus denied the motion for temporary restraining order. As to the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, the court found that the book was transformative since Say used the illustrations to create his own version of Castle’s life. Accordingly, the fact that the book was commercial in nature was “of little significance.” With regard to the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, the court found that Castle’s works were “within the core of intended copyright protection” and that this factor favored the Plaintiff. However, the court stated, “in cases of transformative use, the nature of the work carries less significance.” As to the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the use, the court found that “the copying was necessary to enhance the biographical narrative, told largely through Say’s own illustrations that were not exact copies, but mimicked Castle’s style.” Therefore, the court found that this factor favored Defendants. Lastly, the court held that the fourth factor, the effect on the potential market for the copyrighted work, likely weighed in favor of the Defendants because the Plaintiff “dislikes the way Castle is portrayed in the Book and would not have licensed his art for that use.”",Ninth Circuit; Painting/Drawing/Graphic; Textual work,"Preliminary ruling, fair use found"
"Matthew Lombardo and Who’s Holiday LLC v. Dr. Seuss Enterprises, L.P.","No. 1:16-cv-09974-AKH (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 15, 2017) aff’d, No. 17-2952-cv, 2018 WL 3323476 (2d Cir. July 6, 2018)","2017, affirmed 2018",United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff Matthew Lombardo authored the play Who’s Holiday, and Defendant Dr. Seuss Enterprises owns the copyright in the book How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, which was authored by popular children’s author Dr. Seuss. Who’s Holiday “make[s] fun of” and “criticize[s]” Grinch by incorporating its characters, plot elements, and distinctive rhyming style into a “bawdy, off-color” Christmas comedy that imagines Cindy Lou Who, a Grinch character, in middle-age. In 2016, Defendant sent Plaintiffs a cease-and-desist letter alleging copyright infringement, after which Plaintiffs halted production on Who’s Holiday and filed suit against Defendant, seeking, among other claims, a declaratory judgment that the play constitutes fair use. Defendant filed counterclaims alleging copyright and trademark infringement. The court invited Plaintiffs to file a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the issue of fair use, stating that fair use could be resolved by conducting a side-by-side comparison of Who’s Holiday and Grinch.",Whether Plaintiffs’ use of elements from Grinch in the play Who’s Holiday constitutes fair use.,"Following its four-step fair use analysis, the court held that Who’s Holiday is a fair use, and it granted Plaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed Defendant’s counterclaims for copyright and trademark infringement. As to the first factor (the purpose and character of the use), the court found that the work is a parody since it “subverts the expectations of the Seussian genre,” and therefore it is necessarily transformative. Because the work was deemed to be transformative, the court gave less weight to the fact that the work is of a commercial nature, also a consideration under the first factor. In discussing the second factor (the nature of the copyrighted work), the court reasoned that Grinch is “closer to the core of intended copyright protection” since it is sufficiently creative to merit parodying, but the court noted, for that reason, the second factor is generally of little significance in a parody case. As to the third factor (the amount and substantiality of the use), the court explained that Who’s Holiday’s “use of Grinch is not excessive in relation to the parodic purpose of the copying.” Lastly, the court held that the fourth factor (the effect on the potential market for the copyrighted work), favored a finding of fair use, because the intended “adult audience[]” for Who’s Holiday did not interfere with the market for the original book or the licensing market for derivative works. While Defendant claimed to have previously authorized works that included “themes and jokes aimed at adult audiences,” the court reasoned that Defendant was unlikely to license a parody referencing “bestiality, drug use, and other distinctly ‘un-Seussian’ topics.” On appeal, the Second Circuit found that the district court had correctly analyzed each factor. Regarding the third factor, the Second Circuit noted that Who’s Holiday does not “copy verbatim or quote from the original book.” The Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision.",Second Circuit; Parody/Satire; Textual work,Fair use found
"Penguin Random House LLC, et al. v. Frederik Colting and Melissa Medina, d/b/a Moppet Books","No. 17-cv-386 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 8, 2017)",2017,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Defendants Frederik Colting and Melissa Medina created KinderGuides, which are condensed and sanitized versions of classic novels such as Jack Kerouac’s “On the Road” and Ernest Hemingway’s “The Old Man and the Sea,” with colorful illustrations, aimed at children ages 6 to 12. Defendants planned for a 50-book series. Plaintiffs,the estates of authors Arthur C. Clarke, Jack Kerouac, Truman Capote, and Ernest Hemingway, as well as the publishing houses Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster, filed suit for copyright infringement. Defendants claimed that the books were intended as educational guides, similar to SparkNotes, whereas Plaintiffs argued that KinderGuides were unauthorized derivative works. After discovery, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment.",Whether the creation of versions of classic novels condensed and sanitized for children constitutes fair use.,"After conducting the four-step analysis, the court held that Defendants’ use was not fair. As to the first factor, purpose and character of the use, the court held that “[n]one of [the Defendants’ alleged] alterations are sufficient to sustain” the claim of fair use: abridgements are considered derivative works and not fair use, the removal of adult themes “does not meaningfully ‘recast’ the work any more than an airline’s editing of R-rated films . . . absolve[s] the airline from paying a royalty,” and the KinderGuides do not “qualify as educational criticism or commentary” because the addition of a few pages of commentary “does not provide safe harbor for an otherwise infringing work.” Indeed, the court found that the KinderGuides “do not recount plaintiffs’ Novels in the service of literary analysis, they provide literary analysis in the service of trying to make the [KinderGuides] qualify for the fair use exception.” The court held that the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, weighed against a finding of fair use because the Plaintiffs’ works “are precisely the sorts of creative works that receive special solicitude in a fair use analysis.” As to the third factor, the amount of work used, the court held that “nearly all of [the KinderGuides] are devoted to telling plaintiffs’ copyrighted stories, with only two pages purporting to analyze them;” this factor favored Plaintiffs. Lastly, as to fourth factor, the effect on the market for the copyrighted work, the court noted that “[b]oth sides agree that there is an established market for children’s versions of adult novels” and found Defendants had not met their “burden to show that their works will not [also] adversely affect . . . the market for derivative works based on plaintiffs’ originals.” The court also rejected Defendants’ argument that this factor weighed in favor of fair use because Plaintiffs “have never created, marketed, or licensed any work that remotely resembles” the KinderGuides, stating that “plaintiffs might change their minds.” Defendants also asked the court to assess the interests of the public, arguing that Plaintiffs “explicitly seek to stifle the creation of new works”; the court noted that “Congress did not provide a use-it-or- lose-it mechanism for copyright protection,” and “the fact that any given author has decided not to exploit certain rights does not mean that others gain the right to exploit them.” The court also noted that “[i]mplicit in defendants’ argument. . . is a contention that the Copyright Act itself is unconstitutional,” and because Defendants “make no effort to show that Congress lacked . . . a rational basis for providing plaintiffs an exclusive right to exploit derivative works, . . . this Court cannot provide defendants with the relief they are seeking.”",Second Circuit; Textual Work; Education/Scholarship/Research,Fair use not found

Aug. 30, 2017)",2017,United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas,"Defendant Leah Rothman worked for Plaintiff Peteski Productions as a Segment Director for The Dr. Phil Show from 2003 to 2015. In 2015, she sued Plaintiff and Dr. Phil for false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, retaliation, and wrongful termination. Relating to that lawsuit, Defendant recorded with her iPhone a nine-second clip of Dr. Phil from a larger archive of unaired footage from his television show, in an attempt to document an example of his conduct for her lawsuit. This recording was counter to the terms of Defendant’s employment, which required her to never disclose any unaired footage or statements by Dr. Phil. In 2017, Plaintiff obtained a registered copyright in that nine seconds of video Defendant had captured, and filed suit for copyright infringement. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, or alternatively for summary judgment, arguing that her copying was a fair use.",Whether Defendant’s use of unaired footage for use in a legal proceeding regarding Defendant’s employment with that television show constitutes fair use.,"After conducting the four-step analysis, the court found that the Defendant’s use was not fair as a matter of law, denied her motion, and granted sua sponte summary judgment for Plaintiff on the issue. The court noted at the outset that fair use can be available even where a defendant gained access to the copyrighted work in bad faith. The court concluded that the first factor, purpose and character of the infringing work, weighed “strongly, though not dispositively” against a finding of fair use because Defendant “stole the underlying work in violation of various employment and confidentiality agreements” “for a purely self-serving purpose,” not to advance a public interest. The first factor further weighed against fair use because, while the use was noncommercial, it was “not highly transformative” since she “made no alteration to the work nor did she use it as part of a commentary or criticism.” The second factor, natured of the copyrighted work, “weigh[ed] strongly against fair use” because while the work depict an actual event before filming an episode of the television show, and therefore “possesses a mixed nature of fact and creativity,” it is also “strictly confidential” and unpublished. The third factor, amount and substantiality of the portion used, weighed against fair use as well because Defendant “copied the entire work by recording the nine-second video” from the archives. The final factor, effect of the use upon the potential market, weighed in favor of fair use because, while Plaintiff “is entitled to protect its opportunity to sell the video even if it does not wish to do so now,” “it has failed to identify evidence from which a jury could conclude that [Defendant’s] copying impacted that market at all.” Accordingly, the court found Defendant’s use was not fair.","Fifth Circuit, Film/audiovisual, Used in government proceeding","Fair use not found, Preliminary ruling"
"Disney Enterprises, Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc.","No. 2:16-CV-04109 (9th Cir. Aug. 24, 2017)",2017,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Defendant VidAngel, Inc. operates an online streaming service that removed objectionable content from movies and television shows. Defendant would purchase multiple physical discs containing a copyrighted work, and then decrypt each disc to create a digital copy on a computer so that the work could be tagged for 80 types of inappropriate content, including nudity, profanity, drug use, sex, and violence. Defendant would then upload the tagged copy to cloud storage in segments, and permit customers to purchase that particular copy from Defendant’s inventory. The customer could then select at least one type of filter to apply, and stream that copy via apps Defendant developed for Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire, and Android, among others. No full copy of any individualized, filtered movie existed in fixed form because the filters would be applied as the stream was accessed. Customers could then sell their “discs” back, which would yield them store credit equal to the purchase price of their disc less $1 per day for each day of ownership. Thus, most customers would ""rent"" their copy for $1 per day. Plaintiffs Disney Enterprises, Inc., Lucasfilm Ltd, LLC, Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., and Warner Brothers Entertainment, Inc. produce and distributed copyrighted films and television shows. Defendant purchased, transferred to a computer, and streamed to customers approximately 80 works owned by Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs filed suit for copyright infringement and circumvention of technological measures in violation of 17 U.S.C. § 1201; they moved for a preliminary injunction, and VidAngel raised as defenses the Family Movie Act and fair use. The court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for the injunction, and VidAngel appealed.",Whether Defendant’s sanitizing service that digitizes physical copies of and removes objectionable material from copyrighted works constitutes fair use.,"After conducting the four-step analysis, the court agreed with the district court and affirmed its grant of a preliminary injunction. In assessing the likelihood of Plaintiffs’ success on the merits, the court assessed Defendant’s fair use defense, and found that the use was not fair. The court concluded that it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to find that the first factor, purpose and character of the infringing work, weighed against Defendant because removing objectionable content “does not necessarily add something new or change the expression, meaning, or message of the film,” and is “not transformative.” The court held that the district court correctly found that the second factor, nature of the copyrighted work, and the third factor, amount and substantiality of the portion used, “weigh against finding fair use,” and Defendant did not challenge these findings. The court held that the district court did not err in finding that the final factor, effect of the use upon the potential market, weighed against a finding of fair use as well, because Defendant’s service “is an effective substitute” for Plaintiffs’ unfiltered works. Further, the court noted that space-shifting—the act of shifting media from one platform to another by copying a protected work and transferring it to another electronic device—is not a fair use; case law “unanimously reject[s]” the argument that space-shifting is a fair use, especially because Defendant’s “service is not personal and non-commercial space-shifting.” The court also affirmed the district court’s judgment related to the Family Movie Act and section 1201 defenses and claims, as well as the entry of a preliminary injunction.","Ninth Circuit, Film/Audiovisual, Format shifting/Space shifting, Internet/Digitization","Fair use not found, preliminary ruling"

Defendants Ethan Klein and Hila Klein created a fourteen-minute “reaction video” commenting on Plaintiff’s video, and also posted it to YouTube; in so doing, Defendants showed portions (about three minutes) of Plaintiff’s video. Plaintiff sent YouTube a takedown notification, and YouTube removed the video. Defendants then sent a counter notification challenging the takedown on the basis that their video was, inter alia, fair use and noncommercial. Plaintiff filed an action alleging copyright infringement and seeking section 512(f) damages due to Defendants’ having made alleged misrepresentations in their counter notification. Defendants then posted another video discussing the lawsuit, after which Plaintiff amended his complaint to include a defamation claim. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment.","Whether Defendants’ “reaction video,” showing a large portion of Plaintiff’s copyrighted video, constitutes fair use.","After conducting the four-step analysis, the court found that the Defendants’ use was fair as a matter of law, and granted their motion. The court concluded that the first factor, purpose and character of the infringing work, “weigh[ed] heavily in defendants’ favor,” because their video is “quintessential criticism and comment.” The second factor, nature of the copyrighted work, favored Plaintiff because the work was “entirely scripted and fictional.” The third factor, amount and substantiality of the portion used, was neutral because “to comment on and critique a work, clips of the original may be used,” and their use of clips was “plainly necessary” and “reasonable to accomplish the transformative purpose of critical commentary,” but at the same time, “a great deal of plaintiff’s work was copied.” The final factor, effect of the use upon the potential market, weighed in favor of Defendants because their video “does not serve as a market substitute” for Plaintiff’s video since it “responds to and transforms [Plaintiff’s] video from a skit into fodder for caustic, moment-by-moment commentary and mockery.” Accordingly, the court found Defendants’ use was fair, and granted their motion for summary judgment. The court also dismissed Plaintiff’s claim for damages under section 512(f) because it had found that the use was fair (and therefore Defendants’ argument was true and not a misrepresentation), but also because they need only have had a subjective “good faith belief” that their use was fair to avoid such damages.","Second Circuit, Review/Commentary, Internet/Digitization",Fair use found
"Estate of Anthony Barré and Angel Barré v. Carter, et al.","No. 17-1057 (E.D. Lou. July 25, 2017)",2017,United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana,"Plaintiff Anthony Barré was a well-known performance comedian and music artist in New Orleans who published his performances on YouTube; in 2010 he created a video entitled “Booking the Hoes from New Wildings,” in which he said the phrase, “What happened at the New Orleans,” and a video entitled “A 27 Piece Huh?”, featuring him saying, “Oh yeah baby, I like that” and “Bitch I’m back by popular demand.” Later that year, Barré was murdered; his sister, Angel, was appointed administrator of his estate and registered copyright claims in both videos. In 2016, Defendants, including Beyoncé Knowles Carter and her co-writers, performers, producers, record labels, distributors and publishers, released the song “Formation” on the album “Lemonade,” in which ten seconds of audio of Anthony Barré’s voice is featured saying the above three phrases. Defendants sold over 543,000 copies of “Formation” in the U.S., and the “Formation World Tour” (where, at least in some performances, Anthony Barré’s voice was used) resulted in revenues of over $250 million. Plaintiffs filed suit for copyright infringement, among other claims, alleging that Defendants used Anthony Barré’s voice from the two videos without authorization or compensation. Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs’ copyright claim for failure to state a claim.",Whether Defendants’ use of short clips of someone’s voice in a song and in live musical performances constitutes fair use.,"After conducting the four-step analysis, the court could not find that the Defendants’ use was fair as a matter of law, and denied Defendants’ motion to dismiss. The court concluded that the first factor, purpose and character of the infringing work, “could ultimately weigh against a finding of fair use” because “Plaintiffs plausibly allege that Defendants did not add something new, with a further purpose or different character, but rather used unmodified audio clips from [the] videos,” rendering the use not transformative. Additionally, the court held the use was commercial. The second factor, nature of the copyrighted work, “could ultimately weigh against a finding of fair use” because Plaintiffs’ works are “creative and published.” The third factor, amount and substantiality of the portion used, weighed in favor of Plaintiffs because “even assuming . . . that the amount of Plaintiffs’ copyrighted works used is quantitatively small, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged at this stage of litigation that the portions used by Defendants were qualitatively significant.” As to the final factor, effect of the use upon the potential market, the court stated that “Plaintiffs do not appear to make any allegations [in the complaint] that Defendants’ uncompensated appropriation of YouTube videos would adversely affect the market or potential market for Plaintiffs’ copyrighted works.” In briefing the motion to dismiss, however, Plaintiffs asserted that there was a “vibrant sampling licensing market” for YouTube videos and that Defendants “recognized the necessity of obtaining a license” to the videos; the court noted that the complaint could be amended. At any rate, because “no one factor in the four factor fair use test is dispositive,” the court found that “Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged enough facts on the first three factors at this stage to overcome Defendants’ fair use defense on this motion to dismiss.” Accordingly, the court denied Defendants’ motion to the extent it sought to dismiss Plaintiffs’ copyright infringement claim on fair use grounds.","Fifth Circuit, Film/Audiovisual, Music","Preliminary ruling, fair use not found"
"Donald Graham v. Richard Prince, et al.","No. 15-CV-10160 (S.D.N.Y.

Defendant Richard Prince is a well-known “appropriation artist,” whose work has subjected him to litigation in the past. Prince used Graham’s photograph, Rastafarian Smoking a Joint (“Rastafarian”), to create an artwork known as Untitled (Portrait) (“Untitled”), which was featured by Prince and the other defendants, Gagosian Gallery, Inc. and the gallery’s controlling shareholder Lawrence Gagosian, in an exhibition called New Portraits, as well as in the catalog for that exhibition, a billboard displayed in New York, and in a post by Prince on Twitter. Rastafarian depicts a Rastafarian man with long dreadlocks, shirtless against a white background, smoking a marijuana cigarette; Untitled is a large inkjet print of a screenshot taken by Prince that captures a post made by a third-party user named “rastajay92” on Instagram. The post consists of a slightly cropped copy of Rastafarian. Prince added a comment from his Instagram account (username “richardprince4”), after which he took the screenshot; as such, the work depicts the number of “likes” the post received, Prince’s comment, the original caption by “rastajay92,” and the number of weeks that elapsed between the post and Prince’s screenshot. Graham learned about Untitled in October 2014; several months later, he sent a cease and desist letter, and ultimately filed a complaint in December 2015 alleging willful copyright infringement against Prince for all of his uses of Rastafarian; and against Gagosian Gallery and Lawrence Gagosian on the basis of Untitled and the catalog. The defendants asserted a fair use defense and moved to dismiss the complaint, or to convert that motion into a motion for summary judgment.",Whether Defendants’ near-verbatim use of photograph in appropriation art piece constitutes fair use.,"After conducting the four-step analysis, and beginning that analysis by noting that it is “highly unlikely . . . that a fair use affirmative defense can be addressed on a motion to dismiss,” the court could not find that the Defendants’ use was fair as a matter of law, and denied their motion. The court concluded that the first factor, purpose and character of the infringing work, did not weigh in Defendants’ favor because Untitled “does not make any substantial aesthetic alterations” to Rastafarian, and as such “does not belong to a class of secondary works that are so aesthetically different from the originals that they can pass the Second Circuit’s ‘reasonable viewer’ test” to be found transformative as a matter of law.” The second factor, nature of the copyrighted work, favored Plaintiff because the work “was both creative and published.” The third factor, amount and substantiality of the portion used, “cannot weigh . . . in favor of defendants at the motion to dismiss stage” because defendants “reproduce[d] [Rastafarian] in its entirety, in a size that enables the original to retain its full aesthetic appeal,” and “only a determination that Prince’s use of the photograph was transformative could enable this factor to weigh in their favor.” The final factor, effect of the use upon the potential market, could not weigh in favor of Defendants “because plaintiff has adequately pled that the target audience and the nature of Prince’s Untitled work and the New Portraits Catalog is the same as Graham’s original,” as well as “facts that allow the Court to draw a reasonable inference that Prince’s work can serve as a substitute for Graham’s original work, notwithstanding Prince’s alterations.” Accordingly, the court found the complaint stated a claim entitling Plaintiff to relief.","Second Circuit, Photograph","Preliminary ruling, fair use not found"
Corbello v. DeVito,"No. 2:08-cv-00867-RCJ-PAL (D. Nev. June 14, 2017)",2017,United States District Court for the District of Nevada,"Plaintiff, Donna Corbello, is the widow and heir of Rex Woodward, the writer of a biography about Defendant Thomas DeVito, a founding member of the band The Four Seasons. In 1988, Woodward and DeVito agreed they would be co-authors of DeVito’s “authorized biography,” sharing equally in the book’s proceeds, including any adaptations. In 1990, Woodward completed the book and died shortly thereafter. In 1991, DeVito registered the book in his name only as an unpublished autobiography, and in 1999, transferred his right to adapt the biography for purposes of creating a musical based on the “life and music” of The Four Seasons; the hit musical Jersey Boys opened in 2005. After obtaining an amended copyright registration listing Woodward as co-author of the book, Corbello sued to obtain an accounting of her share of the profits derived from the licensing, or alternatively, the unauthorized use, of the biography to produce Jersey Boys, because she had learned that the biography had “inspired the form, structure, and content of the musical,” and alleged the creators of Jersey Boys had copied assorted scenes and conversations, e.g., the dialogue and scenes concerning the origins of The Four Seasons’ songs. In 2015, the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded a number of claims previously dismissed on summary judgment (mainly various defenses and contractual claims), noting that the 1999 transfer of rights may have lapsed in 2004, such that the subsequent exploitation of the book in Jersey Boys “may have infringed Corbello’s copyright interests.” In 2016, the trial court denied summary judgment on the substantive copyright infringement claims, ruling that there remained “a genuine issue of material fact” as to whether certain dialogue and references in Jersey Boys were fair use. On remand, the court granted Defendants’ motion for judgment as a matter of law in part, and the jury subsequently returned a verdict for the Plaintiff on the remaining substantive claims of copyright infringement, including determining that the use of the biography was not a fair use. Defendants then sought judgment as a matter of law on their fair use defense.",Whether unauthorized use of quotes and other references from an unpublished biography in a Broadway musical was a fair use.,"The court granted Defendants’ motion for judgment as a matter of law with respect to their fair use defense, relying most heavily on the fourth fair use factor, which it called “the most important.” The court held that the first factor, purpose and character of the use, weighed against a finding of fair use “as it does in most cases” because the use is commercial. As to the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, the court held it weighed in favor of fair use because, while the work was unpublished, it was “not unavailable to the public because of a deliberate choice by the copyright owner, but because it [was] not commercially viable,” and as such, the work’s biographical (i.e., factual) nature overshadowed the fact that it was unpublished. The court held that the third factor, the amount of work used, favored a finding of fair use because “the amount of protectable, creative material potentially copied . . . is very small, less than 1%” of the autobiography, and anything taken was factual rather than expressive. Finally, the court held that the fourth factor, effect on the potential market of the work, “greatly favor[ed]” Defendants because before the play debuted, “the [biography] had no market value”; indeed, “[i]f anything, the Play has increased the value of the [biography].”",Ninth Circuit; Unpublished; Textual work,Fair use found
"Estate of James Oscar Smith v. Cash Money Records, Inc., et al.","No. 1:14-cv-02703 (S.D.N.Y. May 30, 2017)",2017,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiffs, the Estate of James Oscar Smith (“Estate”) and Hebrew Hustle, Inc. (“Hebrew Hustle”), assert that they co-own the rights to a spoken word recording on Jimmy Smith’s 1982 album Off the Top. On the track, titled “Jimmy Smith Rap” (“JSR”), Jimmy Smith discusses jazz music and its relative superiority over other types of music, its pivotal line being: “Jazz is the only real music that’s gonna last. All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow. But jazz was, is and always will be.” In 2013, Defendants released an album by Aubrey Drake Graham (“Drake”). The last song, entitled “Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2” (“Pound Cake”) sampled 35 seconds of JSR, deleting and rearranging words from the original lyrics to say, in part, “Only real music is gonna last, all that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow.” Defendant Cash Money Records, Inc. obtained a license for the JSR recording, but not for the composition, which was not registered with the U.S. Copyright Office. After the album was released, the Estate entered into a co- publishing agreement with Hebrew Hustle, registered the JSR composition with the Copyright Office, and then sent Defendants a cease and desist letter.","Whether it was a fair use to alter a recording of a rap song and place it into a hip hop song with a different message, without authorization to use the musical composition.","On cross motions for summary judgment, the district court held that, because there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to ownership and copying, neither party was entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ infringement claims: there was not enough evidence that Jimmy Smith actually authored JSR, and substantial similarity would be better assessed by a jury. But the court also found that any liability for Defendants’ appropriation of JSR is barred because Defendants’ use of it was a fair use. As to the first factor, purpose and character of the use, the court found that some of Defendants’ arguments “conflate the nature of a fair use with that of a derivative work,” but Defendants’ alteration of the message of the JSR track—from “Jazz is the only real music that’s gonna last” to “Only real music is gonna last”—sufficiently transformed the song, since Defendants’ “purpose is ‘sharply different’ from Jimmy Smith’s purpose in creating the original track.” The court held that the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, weighed against a finding of fair use, but was of “limited usefulness” because it had already found the use transformative. As to the third factor, the amount of work used, the court held that “the amount taken by Defendants [was] reasonable in proportion to the needs of the intended transformative use,” and the use of some of the lines “serve[d] to drive the point home.” Lastly, as to fourth factor, the effect on the market for the copyrighted work, the court found there to be “no evidence in the record to suggest that Pound Cake usurps any potential market for JSR or its derivatives.” Defendants’ track “targets a sharply different primary market,” and Plaintiffs “never attempted to establish a market for licensed derivative uses of the JSR composition copyright until Defendants used the recording.”",Second Circuit; Music,Fair use found
Reiner v. Nishimori,"No. 3:15-cv-00241 (M.D. Tenn. Apr. 28, 2017)",2017,United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee,"Plaintiff TC Reiner is a photographer who entered into an independent contractor agreement with SuperStock, Inc. (“SuperStock”), a stock photo company, which paid Reiner to create photographs for its use. SuperStock owned the copyrights to any photographs created under the agreement. Reiner created a photograph called “Casablanca” which he provided to SuperStock during the time period covered by the agreement, but lacked documentation as to who paid the expenses for the shoot. In 2008, a graphic design professor at Defendant Watkins Institute (“Watkins”) included Casablanca among photographs given to students, including Defendant Ryon Nishimori, who were assigned to create mock advertisements using the images. Nishimori uploaded a mock advertisement using Casablanca to his Flickr account to archive it. Watkins did not use Casablanca or Nishimori’s mock advertisement for advertising or promotional purposes, and did not introduce it into any market. Reiner filed suit for direct and contributory copyright infringement against Watkins, copyright infringement against Nishimori, and a violation of section 1202 of the DMCA against both.",Whether use by a university and student for an academic assignment of a photograph constitutes fair use.,"On Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, the court held that there was a disputed issue of fact as to ownership, as Reiner and SuperStock disagreed as to whether Reiner had transferred his copyright in Casablanca to SuperStock. But regardless, Defendants were not liable for infringement because their uses were fair. With respect to the claims against Watkins, as to the first factor, purpose and character of the use, the court held the use was for “nonprofit educational purposes,” because the photograph was not being offered as material for the students to learn, but rather to use to learn how to make mock advertisements. The court held that the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, weighs slightly against fair use, because Casablanca is “more creative than factual.” As to the third factor, the amount of work used, the court held that it weighs against fair use because Watkins used the entire photograph. Lastly, as to fourth factor, the effect on the market for the copyrighted work, the court found Reiner did not establish any market harm because he did not prove “that widespread use of photographs in the manner of Watkins or Nishimori would adversely affect any potential market for his work.” As to Nishomori, the court analyzed his use of the photograph for his mock advertisement, and on his Flickr account for storage. Its analysis was largely the same, though noting that Nishimori transformed Casablanca into an advertisement. Ultimately, the court held that “[t]he fourth factor weighs strongly in favor of fair use” as to Nishimori. Summary judgment was therefore appropriate for Defendants, which rendered the contributory infringement claim moot. The court granted summary judgment on the DMCA claims as well, because, as to Nishimori, he did not know or have reasonable grounds to know that removing Reiner’s information would “induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal an infringement of the federal copyright laws”; as to Watkins, it had no financial interest in the infringement.",Sixth Circuit; Photograph; Education/Scholarship/Research,Fair use found
"Code Revision Comm. v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc.","No. 1:15-cv-02594-RWS (N.D. Ga. Mar. 23, 2017)",2017,United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia,"Plaintiffs, the state of Georgia and its Code Revision Commission (comprised of state legislative and judicial officers), own the copyright to the Official Code of Georgia Annotated (“O.C.G.A.”), which is published and licensed by Lexis/Nexis. In addition to the statutory provisions, which plaintiff requires Lexis/Nexis to make available for free online, the O.C.G.A. includes annotations, editorial notes, chapter analyses, and other material, such as judicial decision summaries, notes on law review articles, and summaries of the opinions of the Attorney General of Georgia. In 2014, plaintiffs received over $80,000 in licensing fee royalties from Lexis/Nexis’ licensing of the O.C.G.A.. Defendant, Public.Resource.Org, a nonprofit organization, “purchased all 186 printed volumes and supplements of the O.C.G.A., scanned them all, and then posted those copies on its website” to “make the O.C.G.A., including the annotations, available” for free to the public.",Whether it is a fair use to make available for free online a verbatim copy of a state’s official annotations to its statutory provisions without obtaining authorization from the copyright owner.,"On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court held that plaintiffs’ annotations to its statutory provisions, as included in the O.C.G.A., were “entitled to copyright protection,” and that it was not fair use for defendant to make a verbatim copy of the O.C.G.A. available online without authorization. To start its four-factor fair use analysis, the court held that the first factor, purpose and character of the use, weighed against fair use. Specifically, the court found that defendant did not transform the work because it did “not add, edit, modify, comment on, criticize, or create any analysis or notes of its own,” and that its use was “neither nonprofit nor educational,” noting, in particular, that defendant profited from “the attention, recognition, and contributions it receive[d] in association with its copying and distributing” of the work. Regarding the second factor, nature of the work, the court explained that the “annotations in this case contain[ed] exactly the evaluative, analytical, or subjectively descriptive analysis” described by the Eleventh Circuit as meriting a neutral, or even negative, weight against fair use. Next, the court found that the third factor, the amount of work used, weighed against fair use because defendant “misappropriated every single word of every annotation using a bulk industrial electronic scanner.” Lastly, the court held that the fourth factor weighed against fair use because “wholesale copying” and distribution of the work for free online “would hinder the economic viability of creating and maintaining the O.C.G.A. because people would be less likely to pay for annotations when they are available for free online.”",Eleventh Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual Work; Used in government proceeding,Fair use not found

Jan. 3, 2017)",2017,United States District Court for the Central District of California,"Plaintiffs, Paramount Pictures Corp. and CBS Studios, own copyrights to the Star Trek movies and television shows, which they also license to third parties to create derivative works. In particular, plaintiffs own copyrighted works about Garth, “a former starship captain . . . famous . . . for his exploits in the Battle of Axanar,” including a television episode, a novel, and a game. Defendant, Axanar Productions, Inc., produced an unauthorized “twenty-one minute film[,] Star Trek: Prelude to Axanar” and a script for a full-length film about “the Battle of Axanar and the exploits of Garth,” collectively, the “Axanar Works.” Prelude to Axanar was made available for free online in order to raise money—over a million dollars in total—to produce the full-length film, which was intended to be “an authentic and independent Star Trek film that [stayed] true to Star Trek canon down to excruciating details,” including use of “many distinctive and widely recognized elements from the Star Trek universe.”","Whether it is a fair use to create new works, including movies and film scripts, which use numerous distinctive elements associated with a series of copyrighted fictional works, without authorization and to use such works as promotional tools to raise money.","On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court held that the Axanar Works were objectively similar to plaintiff’s works, but left the question of subjective similarity for the jury to determine. The court also ruled against defendant’s fair use defense, finding all factors favored plaintiffs. As to the first factor, purpose and character of the use, the court found that the Axanar Works were not transformative because they “[did] not have ‘a further purpose or different character, altering the [Star Trek works] with new expression, meaning, or message’” and were not parodies because they did not “criticize the substance or style of the prior work[s].” Further, defendant’s free distribution of the Axanar Works was found to be commercial because it “profit[ed] from exploitation of [plaintiffs’] copyrighted material without paying the customary price” for a license and because the Axanar Works were used to raise money for future projects. The court held that the second factor, nature of the work, also weighed against fair use because “fictional stories and motion pictures tend to be creative works” that are given “broad copyright protections.” As to the third factor, the amount of work used, the court noted it was “difficult to quantify the amount of the portion used in relation to” plaintiff’s copyrighted works “since ‘the portion’ involves many recurring elements in the Star Trek universe.” Nonetheless, this factor weighed against fair use because elements of plaintiffs’ copyrighted works “pervade[d] the Axanar Works” giving them a “Star Trek feel.” Lastly, noting that “the prequel depicted in the Axanar Works is the kind of potential derivate” that plaintiffs would license, the court had “little doubt that ‘unrestricted and widespread conduct [like defendant’s] would result in a substantially adverse impact’” on the market for the Star Trek works. Thus, the court held that the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the existing and potential market for the work, also weighed against fair use.",Ninth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Parody/Satire,Fair use not found; Preliminary ruling

Dec. 12, 2016)",2016,United States District Court for the Central District of California,"Plaintiffs, Disney, along with three other film studios, own copyrights to movies and television shows, which they license to services that in turn sell access to consumers via streaming or downloading. Defendant, VidAngel, runs a for-profit service, which allows customers to stream “filtered” versions of movies and television episodes, i.e., versions with “objectionable content” removed. Before a VidAngel customer can watch a particular “filtered” movie or television episode, the customer must purchase the physical DVD from VidAngel, at which point VidAngel allows the customer to: review a list of “potentially objectionable content,” “select[] the types of content he or she wishes to have silenced or deleted,” and then instantly stream the “filtered” content. VidAngel “filters” the content it offers by purchasing a physical copy of it, decrypting the content, “tag[ging] the [unencrypted] files for over 80 types of potentially objectionable content” and then storing those files in re-encrypted fragments in the cloud. “VidAngel software assembles the [“filtered”] segments” when a customer later requests to stream a movie or television show. VidAngel’s “filtered” versions are thus created independently from the physical DVDs it sells to its customers, which customers may “sellback” to VidAngel the next day for $1 less than the purchase price.",Whether a service’s unauthorized reproduction and streaming of movies and television shows—after removing certain segments at the request of individual customers that own a physical copy of the content—is fair use.,"The district court preliminarily enjoined VidAngel’s unauthorized video editing and streaming services, finding that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on their copyright infringement claims, while “VidAngel [had] not met [its] burden” of “showing that they are making fair use of the . . . copyrighted works.” Specifically, the court found that all four fair use factors weighed against fair use. With regard to the first factor, purpose and character of the use, the court found that VidAngel’s for-profit “filtering” service was not transformative and weighed “heavily” against fair use because it did “not add anything” to the works and used them for their original “intrinsic entertainment” purpose. The second factor, nature of the work, also weighed against fair use because motion pictures “are closer to the core of intended copyright protection,” making fair use “more difficult to establish.” The court also found that the third factor, the amount of work used, weighed against fair use because “[d]espite the fact that VidAngel’s service omits portions of each work,” it still performs “the heart of the movie,” i.e., “the essential storyline, cinematography, and acting portrayals.” Lastly, the court found that the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the market for the work, weighed against fair use because VidAngel’s own survey evidence showed that its service “serve[d] as an effective substitute for [p]laintiffs’ unfiltered works.”",Ninth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Format shifting/Space shifting,Fair use not found; Preliminary ruling
"TCA Television Corp. v. McCollum,","No. 1:16-cv-0134 (2d Cir. Oct. 11, 2016)",2016,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiffs TCA Television Corp., Hi Neighbor, and Diana Abbott Colton, the heirs of Abbott and Costello, asserted ownership in the copyright of the infamous comedy routine Who’s On First? Defendants, Kevin McCollum and additional producers of the critically-acclaimed Broadway dark comedy Hand to God, used one minute and seven seconds of dialogue from Who’s On First? in a scene where the main character, Jason, tries to impress a girl by performing the routine with his sock-puppet. When Jason claims to have made up the routine, his sock-puppet calls him a liar and tells the girl that the sketch “is a ‘famous routine from the Fifties’”—creating a scene that sets the “starting point for the gradual exposure of the darker side of Jason’s personality.” Plaintiffs brought a copyright infringement claim against defendants’ unauthorized use of part of Who’s On First? in Hand to God. The district court dismissed the claim, finding that defendants’ use of the routine had a “new and different function” in the play and was therefore a transformative fair use. Plaintiffs appealed.",Whether defendants’ unauthorized use of part of plaintiffs’ recorded comedy routine in a Broadway comedy qualifies as fair use.,"Finding that all four factors weighed against fair use, the Second Circuit concluded that “defendants’ verbatim use” of the comedy routine “was not a fair use.” The court, however, affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the suit on the alternative ground that plaintiffs did not allege a valid copyright interest in the routine. As to the first factor, purpose and character of the use, the Second Circuit found that defendants’ commercial exploitation of the routine weighed against fair use and that the use could not be “deemed transformative” despite incorporation of the routine into “a sharply different context from its original authors” because “there is ‘nothing transformative’ about using an original work ‘in the manner it was made to be’ used.” Rather, the court reasoned, “the critical inquiry is whether the new work uses the copyrighted material itself for a purpose, or imbues it with a character, different from that for which it was created.” If this were not the test, “any play that needed a character to sing a song, tell a joke, or recite a poem could use unaltered copyrighted material with impunity, so long as the purpose or message of the play was different from that of the appropriated material.” Additionally, the court noted that “even a correct finding of transformative use is not necessarily determinative of the first statutory factor, much less of fair use.” Next, the court held that the second statutory factor, the nature of the work, weighed “strongly” in the plaintiffs’ favor because the creative, as opposed to factual, nature of Who’s On First? “lies at the heart of copyright’s intended protection.” The court also found that the third factor, the amount of work used, “weigh[ed] strongly in favor of plaintiffs” because defendants engaged in “substantial copying” of the routine without a “persuasive justification.” Lastly, with regard to the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for the work, the Second Circuit found that the district court erred in “disregard[ing] the possibility of defendants’ use adversely affecting the licensing market for the [r]outine.” In its de novo review, the Second Circuit found that plaintiffs alleged “the existence of a traditional—and active—derivative market for licensing the [r]outine” and that defendants’ unauthorized use would “negatively affect[ the] commercial market for future licensing.”",Second Circuit; Film/Audiovisual,Fair Use Not Found

Jul. 20, 2016)",2016,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff, BWP Media, owns copyrights to photographs of celebrities that it licenses to print and online publications. Defendant, Gossip Cop Media, runs a “for-profit website that presents celebrity gossip news” and evaluates the truthfulness of gossip stories published by third-parties. Gossip Cop licenses many of the celebrity photographs on its website, but, in this instance, it copied—without authorization—three photographs from third-party “celebrity gossip websites,” “posted ‘screen grabs’ of the photos on its own site,” and added “an assessment of whether the story that accompanied the photo on the third-party website was ‘real’ or ‘rumor.’”",Whether a celebrity gossip website’s unauthorized use of three photographs from other gossip websites in order to “comment on or critique the stories that originally accompanied those photographs” is fair use.,"Following a bench trial, the court ruled that Gossip Cop’s unauthorized, commercial use of three photographs did not constitute fair use either as a transformative use or as news reporting because the photographs were “taken to be used by celebrity news outlets” and Gossip Cop used the photographs “for the precise reason[s they were] created.” While the court did hold that the second statutory factor, the nature of the work, weighed “slightly in [d]efendant’s favor” because the photographs were taken “to document their subjects rather than to serve as art pieces,” the court held the remaining three factors to weigh against fair use. Specifically, with regard to the first factor, purpose and character of the use, the court reasoned that Gossip Cop’s use— rating the validity of the stories as opposed to the photographs—“cannot be said to constitute transformative news reporting” because it “adds no new meaning or expression to the images.” Rather, the court held that Gossip Cop “used the photographs to illustrate its stories, which is precisely the same use as that made by the source websites” which paid to display the photographs. The court also held that the third factor, the amount of work used, weighed against fair use because the defendant “copied the entirety of the three images” and used the images for the same purpose as the other gossip websites. Lastly, the court found that the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for the work, also weighed against fair use because Gossip Cop’s use of the photos to “attract interest in [its] accompanying stories . . . is . . . the same use for which [BWP] routinely licenses out its photos.”",Second Circuit; Photograph; News reporting; Review/Commentary,Fair use not found
Cambridge University Press v. Mark P. Becker,"No. 1:08-cv-01425-ODE (N.D. Ga. Mar. 31, 2016) appeal docketed, Aug. 26, 2016",2016,United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia,"In 2008, plaintiffs Cambridge University Press and other publishing houses sued Georgia State University (GSU) officials for contributorily infringing their copyrights due to a fair use policy (and checklist) that allowed GSU faculty to post unlicensed portions of the publishers’ works on university systems for students to obtain electronically. Plaintiffs pursued 74 allegations of infringement (initially 99, but dropped 25 at trial) and provided evidence that GSU could have purchased licenses for some of the works at issue. In 2012, of the 74 allegations at issue, the District Court for the Northern District of Georgia found that plaintiffs has not established a prima facie case of infringement for 26 allegations, and of the remaining 48 allegations, GSU had only infringed plaintiffs’ works in five instances.. As such, the district court held that GSU’s fair use policy led to the unlicensed and infringing use of five excerpts of plaintiffs’ works because the policy “did not limit copying in those instances [of infringement] to decidedly small excerpts . . . [and it] did not provide sufficient guidance in determining the ‘actual or potential effect on the market or the value of the copyrighted work.’” Plaintiff’s appealed the district court’s decision as to the 48 allegations of infringement and the Eleventh Circuit reversed the judgement and remanded for further proceedings because of the district court’s flawed method of fair use analysis. In particular, the Eleventh Circuit found that the district court erred in “giving each of the four fair use factors equal weight,” “setting a 10 percent-or- one-chapter benchmark” for the third factor, and should “have afforded the fourth fair use factor more significant weight in its overall fair use analysis.” On remand, the district court revaluated the specific instances of alleged infringement according to guidance from the Eleventh Circuit that required a more holistic balancing of the four fair use factors.",Whether Georgia State University’s adoption of the 2009 copyright policy caused ongoing and continuing misuse of the fair use doctrine and resulted in infringement of plaintiffs’ works.,"As directed by the Eleventh Circuit, the district court conducted a revised four-step analysis of each of the 48 allegation of infringement for which the plaintiffs had met their prima facie burden. In its revised analysis, the district court found that the GSU fair use policy led to infringing use of plaintiffs’ works, this time, in four as opposed to five instances. The court found that the remaining 44 uses qualified as fair use. Although the weight and outcome of the factors varied for each alleged instance of infringement, the district court generally concluded that: (1) the first factor, purpose and character of the use, weighed in favor of fair use despite the nontransformative nature of the use because GSU is a nonprofit educational institution and the excerpts were used for the purpose of teaching students; (2) the second factor, the nature of the work, was “of comparatively little weight in this case, particularly because the works at issue are neither fictional nor unpublished;” (3) the third factor, the amount of work used, must take into account “the effect of the favored nonprofit educational purpose of the use under factor one,” while considering “the impact of market substitution as recognized under factor four, in determining whether the quantity and substantiality . . . of [d]efendants’ unlicensed copying was excessive;” and (4) the fourth factor, effect of the use on the potential market for the work, “concern[ed] not the market for Plaintiffs’ original works . . . but rather a market for licenses” to use excerpts, which initially favored plaintiffs where evidence of digital licensing was available. Taking into account the Eleventh Circuit’ guidance to afford “the fourth fair use factor more significant weight in its overall fair use analysis,” the district court estimated the initial weight of each of the four factors as follows: “25% for factor one, 5% for factor two, 30% for factor three and 40% for factor four.” Based on these findings of infringement, the court ordered plaintiffs to submit proposed text for injunctive and declaratory relief aimed at preventing future infringement of their works.",Eleventh Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Internet/Digitization; Textual work,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
"Dominick Ranieri v. Adirondack Dev. Group LLC,","No. 1.11-cv-1013-GTS-CFH (N.D.N.Y. Feb. 22, 2016)",2016,United States District Court for the Northern District of New York,"Plaintiff, Dominick Ranieri, is an architect who worked on housing design projects for Adirondack Development Group and other associated developers (collectively, “ADG”). ADG entered into three separate agreements with Ranieri to provide designs, plans, and drawings for three housing developments, Vly Point, Admiral’s Walk, and Patroon Point. ADG was not authorized to use the designs for any other developments. ADG finished construction of Patroon Point in 2002 and subsequently terminated Ranieri’s remaining contracts. Ranieri then advised ADG that they could no longer use his designs for the ongoing construction of Vly Point and Admiral’s Walk. ADG, however, used Ranieri’s Patroon Point drawings as a basis for building Jordan Point, a fourth housing development. It also provided Ranieri’s designs to defendant Coldwell Banker Prime (“C.B. Prime”), its “exclusive listing agent for the marketing and sales of the” housing developments. Without Ranieri’s authorization, C. B. Prime used simplified versions of the designs for Patroon Point “to advertise the basic floor plans for the condominium units” in Jordan Point.",Whether a real estate company’s unauthorized use of a simplified version of an architectural design in marketing materials intended to attract customers to buy property is a fair use?,"The court’s summary judgment fair use analysis was limited to defendant C.B. Prime’s unauthorized use of Ranieri’s designs. Specifically, the court held that the first factor, purpose and character of the use, weighed against fair use because C.B. Prime “merely copied [p]laintiff’s drawings” and had a “primary motive” in using the drawings to “attract potential customers . . . for financial gain.” The court held that the second statutory factor, the nature of the work, also weighed against fair use because architectural works are generally considered “creative works,” and the defendant did not argue otherwise. On the other hand, the court found that the third factor, the amount of work used, weighed in favor of fair use because the defendant “used only the basic features of [p]laintiff’s designs.” And the court found that the fourth statutory factor, effect of the use on the potential market for the work, also weighed in favor of fair use because although C.B. Prime’s use “undermines” and “competes” with Ranieri’s, it did not usurp the market because Ranieri’s “designs are still viable and can be marketed for other projects.” Finding that “reasonable minds could differ as to whether fair use applies when weighing all of these factors together,” the court thus denied defendant’s motion for summary judgment because it could not conclude, as a matter of law, that C.B. Prime’s use was fair.",Second Circuit; Painting/Drawing/Graphic,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
"Kennedy v. Gish, Sherwood & Friends, Inc.,","No. 4:13-cv-02236-JAR (E.D. Mo. Nov. 5, 2015)",2015,United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri,"Kennedy, a professional photographer, displays his copyrighted photos on his websites. Defendant Gish, Sherwood & Friends, Inc. (Gish), an advertising agency, copied low-resolution versions of 169 photographs, through screenshots, from Kennedy’s websites and used 39 of these images in sample advertisements for internal evaluation by its client. Kennedy brought suit against Gish for its unauthorized copying and use of his photos. Gish argued its actions were protected under fair use because the copying and use of low- resolution images in advertising samples was a common industry practice known as “comp” use, and because such use transformed the photos by “re- siz[ing], cropp[ing], plac[ing] into graphic designs and supplement[ing]” them with text.",Whether defendant’s unauthorized use of low-resolution images of plaintiff’s photographs for internal evaluation of advertising samples qualifies as fair use.,"The court determined on summary judgment that Gish’s unauthorized “copying of 169 of Kennedy’s low-resolution images through screenshots, and subsequent alteration of those images for use in a series of story boards . . . presentations, a . . . video, . . . posters, and a counter card design” as samples for internal evaluation by its client, was fair use. The court found that factors one, three and four of the statutory fair use analysis weighed in favor of fair use. With regard to the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, the court held that Gish’s alterations of the photos placed them “in a new context to serve a different purpose” than the originals and therefore constituted a transformative use that outweighed the commercial nature of the use. The parties did not dispute that Kennedy’s photos were creative, thus the court weighed the second statutory factor, the nature of the work, in favor of Kennedy. Next, despite the fact that Gish had copied the entirety of each photo, the court found that the third factor, the amount of the work used, weighed in favor of fair use because “even making an exact copy of the work is justifiable where the purpose of the work differs from the original.” Lastly, the court found that the fourth statutory factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for the work, weighed in favor of fair use because: (1) “market harm cannot be readily inferred” where the use is transformative; and (2) there was no evidence of lost revenues from Gish given evidence of Kennedy’s practice of offering free licenses for comp use to other advertising agencies. In its summary judgment opinion, the court declined to resolve infringement claims relating to Gish’s distribution of copies of the photos to its client, stating that factual matters remained for the jury.",Eighth Circuit; Photograph; Painting/Drawing/Graphic,Fair Use Found; mixed result
"Katz v. Google, Inc.","No. 14-14525 (11th Cir. Sept. 17, 2015)",2015,United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit,"Plaintiff Katz, a “commercial real estate tycoon,” owns the copyright in a photograph of himself that he has characterized as “compromising” and “embarrassing.” Defendant Chevaldina, “a disgruntled former tenant in one of Katz’s shopping centers,” found the photograph through a Google image search and reproduced it in several blog articles “devoted to sharply criticizing Katz” and his business practices. Katz initiated an infringement action, alleging direct infringement against defendant Chevaldina and contributory infringement against Google Inc. (Katz later dropped his claim against Google). At the district court level, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida ruled that Chevaldina’s reproduction of the photograph was fair use and entered summary judgment against Katz.",Whether defendant’s unauthorized reproduction of a photograph in blog posts critical of the photograph’s subject qualifies as fair use.,"The Eleventh Circuit ruled that Chevaldina’s reproduction of the photograph in her blog posts was fair use. The court found that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, weighed in Chevaldina’s favor. It held that Chevaldina’s reproduction was non-commercial, “primarily educational,” and served the transformative purpose of criticizing and satirizing Katz’s character. The court also weighed the second factor, the nature of the work, in defendant’s favor, finding the photograph to be “primarily a factual work,” explaining that it was “merely a candid shot in a public setting” and there was no evidence that the photographer “attempted to convey ideas, emotions, or in any way influence Katz’s pose, expression, or clothing.” The court found that the third factor, the amount of the work used, was neutral. Despite Chevaldina having reproduced the entire photograph in many of her blog posts, the court held that copying any less of the photograph “would have made the picture useless to [Chevaldina’s] story.” For the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for the work, the court found that “[s]ince there is no evidence Chevaldina's use of the [p]hoto had or would have any impact upon any actual or potential market, the fourth factor weighs in favor of fair use.”",Eleventh Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Photograph; Review/Commentary,Fair use found
Galvin v. Ill. Republican Party,"No. 1:14-cv-00490 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 9, 2015)",2015,United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois,"Plaintiff Galvin, a professional photographer, owns the copyright in a photograph he took of plaintiff Meister. The photograph shows Meister participating in a political parade and driving in a convertible decorated with a poster promoting the reelection of Democratic Illinois politician Sam Yingling. Galvin authorized Yingling to post the photograph of Meister on his campaign website. Defendants Illinois Republican Party and other related organizations made unauthorized copies of Galvin’s photograph, altered the photograph so that it appeared as though Meister (who defendants mistook for Yingling) was driving away from the Illinois State Capitol with stolen money, included the altered photo in a flyer critical of Yingling’s performance as a member of the Illinois House of Representatives, and mailed several thousand copies of the flyer to potential voters. Plaintiffs filed suit, claiming defendants’ flyers infringed the copyright in the original photograph. Defendants moved to dismiss the claim, maintaining that their use of the photograph was permissible under the fair use doctrine.",Whether defendants’ unauthorized reproduction of an altered version of copyright protected photograph in political flyers constitutes fair use.,"The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois found defendant’s reproduction of the photograph in its political flyer to be fair use. The court concluded that the first fair use factor, the purpose and character of the use, was not dispositive. Specifically, it noted that the critical and political nature of defendants’ flyer did not in and of itself override the copyright protection accorded to the photograph and that defendants had alternative means of conveying their political message that did not require use of the photograph. But the court weighed the second factor, the nature of the work, in favor of defendants, finding the photograph to be “primarily factual in nature,” as it was a “candid image” and plaintiff “obviously did not stage the action depicted in it.” The court found that the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, favored plaintiffs. It highlighted the “qualitative similarities” between the photograph and the version of the photograph in defendants’ flyer and again noted that the defendants had alternative means of expressing their political criticism. Regarding the fourth factor, the court found that defendants’ use of the photograph was unlikely to impact the potential market for the photograph. In response to plaintiffs’ assertion that defendants’ use would harm the reputation of the photograph’s subject, the court stated that protection from “[p]otential market harm due to [a] blemished reputation” is “simply not a purpose of copyright law.”",Seventh Circuit; Parody/Satire; Photograph; Review/Commentary,Fair use found
"Authors Guild, Inc. v. Google Inc.,","No. 13-4829-cv (2d Cir. Oct. 16, 2015)",2015,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Defendant Google, Inc. collaborated with several major research libraries to digitize their collections for the Google Books project. Plaintiffs, the Authors Guild, Inc. and individual copyright owners, complained that Google scanned more than twenty-million books without permission or payment of license fees. Google made the digital copies available to its library partners. It also maintained copies on Google servers and on backup tapes, created an electronic index, and displayed “snippets” of text in search engine results. Plaintiffs alleged that Google infringed by using copyrighted books without permission. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York held that Google’s digitization and subsequent use of the copyrighted works was fair use and granted summary judgment in Google’s favor. The Authors Guild appealed the district court’s ruling.","Whether it was fair use to digitally copy entire books from library collections, without permission or payment, and to make the digital copies available for library collections and for the public to search electronically using a search engine.","The Second Circuit agreed with the district court’s ruling that Google’s digitization and subsequent use of the copyrighted works was fair use. In concluding that Google’s use was transformative, the circuit court found that “Google’s making of a digital copy to provide a search function . . . augments public knowledge by making available information about [p]laintiffs’ books without providing the public with a substantial substitute for matter protected by the [p]laintiffs’ copyright interests in the original works or derivatives of them.” The court likewise found that “Google’s provision of digital copies to participating libraries, authorizing them to make non-infringing uses, is non- infringing, and the mere speculative possibility that the libraries might allow use of their copies in an infringing manner does not make Google a contributory infringer.” Regarding the “amount and substantiality” of the works used, the circuit court agreed with the district court’s finding that Google’s copying of entire texts to enable the Google Books “full-text search function” was not dispositive of a finding of fair use because Google limited the amount of text it displayed to users in search engine results. Regarding the Google Books project’s potential to impact the market for or value of the copyrighted works, the circuit court held that—despite the search function’s potential to cause “some loss of sales”—the brevity of the snippet search results and the “cumbersome, disjointed, and incomplete nature of the aggregation of snippets made available through snippet view” make it unlikely that Google’s use could “provide a significant substitute for the purchase of the author’s book.”",Second Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Format shifting/Space shifting; Internet/Digitization; Textual work,Fair use found
"TD Bank, N.A. v. Hill","No. 1.12-cv-07188-RBK-JS (D. N.J. July 27, 2015)",2015,United States District Court for the District of New Jersey,"Defendant Hill was a founder and former Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Commerce Bancorp, LLC (“Commerce Bank”). While employed at Commerce Bank, he co-authored an unpublished manuscript entitled “Fans, Not Customers: Creating Super Growth in a No-Growth Industry” (the “2007 Manuscript”). Defendant separated from Commerce Bank in 2007. In 2012 he published a book entitled “Fans! Not Customers: How to Create Growth Companies in a No Growth World” (the “2012 Book”). Plaintiff TD Bank, N.A. (“TD Bank”) was the successor by merger to Commerce Bank. Shortly after defendant published the 2012 Book, plaintiff initiated a lawsuit against defendant claiming it owned the copyright in the unpublished 2007 Manuscript—which it considered a work made for hire. In district court, plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment asking the court to find that it was the exclusive owner of the copyright in the 2007 Manuscript and that 16% of the material in the 2012 Book was copied from the 2007 Manuscript. Defendant filed a cross-motion asking the court to find that he owned the copyright in the 2007 Manuscript and that, even if the court were to determine plaintiff owned the copyright, reproduction of portions of the 2007 Manuscript in the 2012 Book was non-infringing fair use.",Whether plaintiff or defendant owned the copyright in the 2007 Manuscript. Whether defendant’s copying of portions of the 2007 Manuscript for use in the 2012 Book constituted fair use.,"The court determined that the 2007 Manuscript was created as a work made for hire and that plaintiff was the exclusive owner of the copyright in the work. Regarding fair use, the court found that defendant’s copying of portions of the 2007 Manuscript was not fair use. In reaching its conclusion, the court found that “at least three of the four” statutory fair use factors favored plaintiff. Specifically, the court found that the purpose and character of defendant’s use was commercial in nature, that defendant’s verbatim copying of portions of the 2007 Manuscript included more than mere unprotectable facts and ideas, and that the publishing of the 2012 Book would likely cause “some impairment” to the market for the unpublished 2007 Manuscript. In weighing the “amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the work,” the court assessed the quantitative aspects of the work (it found that 16% of the material in the 2012 Book was copied from the 2007 Manuscript) as well as the qualitative aspects of the work (it found that the portion of the 2007 Manuscript copied was “central to the telling of the Commerce Bank story”) and determined that this factor “at best” favored “each party equally.”",Third Circuit; Textual work; Unpublished,Fair use not found

Jan. 12, 2015)",2015,United States District Court for the Central District of California,"Defendant Dish Network, LLC (Dish) developed and distributed the Hopper, a digital video recorder (DVR) with video on-demand capabilities. At the same time, Dish introduced a feature called PrimeTime Anytime with AutoHop. PrimeTime Anytime allowed subscribers to set a single timer to record primetime programming on major broadcast networks, including plaintiff Fox Broadcasting Co.’s (Fox’s) programs. Dish subscribers had to enable the service, and copies were stored on the DVR for a number of days pre-selected by Dish. AutoHop allowed subscribers to automatically skip commercials, after the time points of those commercials were indexed by Dish, using “quality assurance” copies of Fox’s works. Fox alleged direct and contributory infringement, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s denial of a preliminary injunction because Fox had not established a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims. Fox Broad. Co. v. Dish Network LLC., 723 F.3d 1067 (9th Cir. 2013) amended and reh’g en banc denied, 747 F.3d 1060 (9th Cir. 2014). In this subsequent district court proceeding, the parties filed motions for summary judgment which addressed, among other issues, whether Dish’s PrimeTime Anytime with Autohop features constituted fair use.",Whether it was fair use for Dish to copy Fox’s programming for its PrimeTime Anytime service and to make separate copies of said programing for quality assurance purposes.,"Consistent with the Ninth Circuit’s fair use determination, which relied heavily on Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 (1984), the district court held that the copying of Fox’s programming facilitated via Dish’s PrimeTime Anytime and AutoHop technology was fair use. Quoting the Ninth Circuit, the district court stated “[i]f recording an entire copyrighted program is fair use, the fact that viewers do not watch the ads not copyrighted by Fox cannot transform the recording into a copyright violation.” 723 F.3d at 1075. The district court further held that the copies Dish made for “quality assurance” purposes in indexing the times of commercials for the AutoHop functionality were infringing and not protected under the fair use doctrine. In reaching its conclusion, the court found that “quality assurance” copies were not transformative, were made for a commercial purpose, and had the potential to impair Fox's ability to enter into similar licensing agreements with other future technology creators seeking to make analogous use of its works.",Ninth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Format shifting/Space Shifting; Internet/Digitization,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"

(eBay) infringed the copyrights in several of his works, including a set of photographs that plaintiff licensed for use in physical magazines. Plaintiff claimed that eBay violated his copyrights in the set of photographs by: (1) hosting user generated listings for the resale of the physical magazines that displayed digital pictures of physical prints of his photographs as they originally appeared in the magazines, and (2) relying on servers maintained by a content delivery network (CDN) to facilitate the display of the digital pictures of his photographs to eBay’s end users. Defendant eBay claimed its use of the photographs was protected under the fair use doctrine.","Whether defendant’s use of digital reproductions of copyright protected photographs to advertise the resale of physical products containing those photographs, including automated copying and distribution of those images over CDNs, constituted fair use.","The court concluded that “copies made of a magazine containing depictions of a copyrighted work, for the purpose of selling that magazine under the first sale doctrine, do not violate the Copyright Act under the fair use doctrine.” In reaching its conclusion that the digital display of the works was fair use, the court found that “looking holistically at the purpose of copyright protection and the use to which the photographs are being put,” the copies in question clearly did not displace the market for the original work, were used for a fundamentally different purpose than the original photographs, and promoted the development of “a robust legal secondary market.” Regarding eBay’s use of a CDN to facilitate the display of the images to end users, the court found that such distribution is “an inevitable and necessary part of using the internet, and ultimately a trivial activity that falls within the protections of the fair use doctrine” without reference to the fair use factors.",Ninth Circuit; Internet/Digitization; Photograph,Fair use found

Kinney’s translation of The Golden Ass, by Apuleius; and R.E. Lantham’s translation of On the Nature of Things, by Lucretius (collectively, “the Works”). American Buddha digitized and published the text of each Work, in its entirety, on its various websites. The text American Buddha included on its websites was identical to the Penguin-controlled text, but contained formatting alterations such as bold print, links and images. Penguin filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, seeking to enjoin American Buddha from directly or indirectly infringing its copyrights in the Works. This decision pertains to the district court’s disposition of Penguin’s motion for summary judgment on its claim for injunctive relief.",Whether American Buddha’s digitization and publication of Penguin’s copyright protected works on its websites was fair use.,"The court held that American Buddha’s digitization and publication of Penguin’s Works was not fair use. In reaching its conclusion, the court determined all four statutory fair use factors weighed in Penguin’s favor. The court found that the formatting changes American Buddha made to the Works, as they appeared on the American Buddha websites, were not sufficiently transformative to weigh in favor of a finding of fair use. The court also found that the Works at issue (fiction writings and translations) were creative in nature, that American Buddha essentially repackaged and reproduced the Works in their entirety, and that American Buddha’s unauthorized copying had the potential to impact both Penguin’s ability to control the quality of the distribution of the Works and the market for sale of the Works.",Ninth Circuit; Internet/Digitization; Textual work,Fair use not found

DLT Entertainment Ltd. (“DLT”) owned the copyright in Three’s Company. In 2012, DLT sent a “cease-and-desist” letter to Adjmi and the several production companies responsible for performances of 3C. The letter claimed 3C infringed DLT’s copyright in Three’s Company and demanded Adjmi and others refrain from producing further performances of the play (among other demands). In response, Adjmi sought declaratory judgment that 3C does not infringe DLT’s copyright in Three’s Company. In support of his action, Adjmi claimed his copying aspects of Three’s Company was for the purpose of parody, and thus fair use.",Whether the owners of the copyright in the television series Three’s Company could prevail in a copyright infringement action against the author and/or producers of a play that copies various aspects of the television series.,"The court ruled that 3C is a parody and a fair use of Three’s Company, holding that “there can be no set of facts to support an action for copyright infringement by DLT against Adjmi.” In reaching its conclusion, the court found 3C to be a highly transformative parody of Three’s Company and a “drastic departure” from the original television series. Specifically, the court determined that, while there is no question that 3C copies the plot premise, characters, sets, and certain scenes from Three's Company, it uses “the familiar Three’s Company construct” as “a vehicle to criticize and comment on the original’s light-hearted, sometimes superficial, treatment of certain topics and phenomena.” The court further determined that 3C uses the “raw material” of Three’s Company to create “new information, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings” and represents “the very type of activity that the fair use doctrine intends to protect for the enrichment of society.”",Second Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Parody/Satire; Textual work,Fair use found

The Facebook page on which the combined image appeared belonged to Fox’s Justice with Judge Jeanine program, hosted by co-defendant Jeanine Pirro.",Whether defendants’ reproduction of plaintiff’s photograph on a Facebook page was fair use.,"The court determined it could not conclude as a matter of law whether defendants’ reproduction of plaintiff’s photograph was fair use. The court found that, although defendant’s use was not transformative, material questions of fact existed concerning the purpose of the use. It further found that the fourth fair use factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyright work, weighed against a finding of fair use. In assessing that factor, the court noted that plaintiff “maintains an active licensing program for the photograph, including by licensing the [photograph] to media entities for editorial use, precisely the type of use [d]efendants urge they intended here.”",Second Circuit; Internet/Digitization; Photograph,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
"Cambridge Univ. Press v. Patton,",769 F.3d 1232 (11th Cir. 2014),2014,United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit,"Plaintiffs Cambridge University Press and other publishing houses sued Georgia State University officials for infringing their copyrights by allowing unlicensed portions of their works to be posted on university systems for students to obtain electronically. After the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia granted defendants’ summary judgment on plaintiffs’ claims of direct and vicarious infringement, it considered plaintiffs’ allegations of continuing contributory infringement under defendants’ revised fair use policy, which was implemented in February 2009 after the suit commenced. The revised policy required professors to complete a form to determine whether the fair use doctrine permitted them to post materials electronically for students to access. After establishing some general fair use guidelines for its analysis, the district court individually reviewed 74 violations plaintiffs alleged were the result of continuing infringement under the revised 2009 fair use policy. The court held that the revised policy did not provide adequate guidelines, which caused ongoing and continuing misuse of the fair use defense and resulted in five incidents of infringement.",Whether Georgia State University’s adoption of the 2009 copyright policy caused ongoing and continuing misuse of the fair use doctrine and resulted in infringement of plaintiffs’ works.,"The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court’s decision and remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion, which the court summarized as follows: In sum, we hold that the District Court did not err in performing a work- by-work analysis of individual instances of alleged infringement in order to determine the need for injunctive relief. However, the District Court did err by giving each of the four fair use factors equal weight, and by treating the four factors mechanistically. The District Court should have undertaken a holistic analysis which carefully balanced the four factors in the manner we have explained. The District Court did not err in holding that the first factor—the purpose and character of the use—favors fair use. Although Defendants’ use was nontransformative, it was also for nonprofit educational purposes, which are favored under the fair use statute. However, the District Court did err in holding that the second fair use factor—the nature of the copyrighted work—favors fair use in every case. Though this factor is of comparatively little weight in this case particularly because the works at issue are neither fictional nor unpublished, where the excerpts in question contained evaluative, analytical, or subjectively descriptive material that surpasses the bare facts, or derives from the author’s own experiences or opinions, the District Court should have held that the second factor was neutral or even weighed against fair use where such material dominated. With regard to the third factor—the amount used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole—the District Court erred in setting a 10 percent-or-one-chapter benchmark. The District Court should have performed this analysis on a work-by-work basis, taking into account whether the amount taken—qualitatively and quantitatively—was reasonable in light of the pedagogical purpose of the use and the threat of market substitution. However, the District Court appropriately measured the amount copied based on the length of the entire book in all cases, declined to give much weight to the Classroom Guidelines, and found that the Defendants’ educational purpose may increase the amount of permissible copying. With regard to the fourth factor—the effect of Defendants’ use on the market for the original—the District Court did not err. However, because Defendants’ unpaid copying was nontransformative and they used Plaintiffs’ works for one of the purposes for which they are marketed, the threat of market substitution is severe. Therefore, the District Court should have afforded the fourth fair use factor more significant weight in its overall fair use analysis. Finally, the District Court erred by separating two considerations from its analysis of the first and fourth fair use factors . . . . Because the District Court’s grant of injunctive relief to Plaintiffs was predicated on its finding of infringement, which was in turn based on the District Court’s legally flawed methodology in balancing the four fair use factors and erroneous application of factors two and three, we find that the District Court abused its discretion in granting the injunction and the related declaratory relief. Similarly, because the District Court’s designation of Defendants as the prevailing party and consequent award of fees and costs were predicated on its erroneous fair use analysis, we find that the District Court erred in designating Defendants as the prevailing party and awarding fees and costs to Defendants.",Eleventh Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Internet/Digitization; Textual work,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
White v. West Pub. Corp.,"No. 12-cv-1340-JSR (S.D.N.Y. Jul. 3, 2014)",2014,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff, Edward White, is a lawyer and obtained copyright registrations for briefs he submitted in an unrelated legal proceeding through the PACER database. PACER “allows members of the public to retrieve and download a copy of [] document[s].” Defendants, West Publishing Corp. (“West”) and Reed Elsevier, Inc. (“Lexis”), create and license databases which “offer users access to,” among other things, “select legal documents . . . filed, without seal, in state and federal courts.” Defendants downloaded White’s briefs from PACER and added them to their respective databases after converting the briefs into “text-searchable” documents and adding other characteristics to enhance their searchability (e.g., metadata codes, links to related materials, and unique identifiers). Plaintiff sued defendants for infringement based on their unauthorized inclusion of his briefs in their commercial databases.",Whether the unauthorized inclusion of the entirety of publicly-filed court documents in a commercial database after conversion into more searchable files is fair use.,"On summary judgment, the court ruled that defendants’ unauthorized copying and inclusion of the entirety of legal briefs in their commercial databases constituted fair use. The court held that three of the four statutory fair use factors weighed in favor of fair use and that the remaining factor was neutral. With regard to the first factor, purpose and character of the use, the court reasoned that the defendants’ use was transformative because the briefs were created “solely for the purpose of providing legal services to [plaintiff’s] clients[, while] . . . defendants used the brief[s] . . . [to] creat[e] an interactive legal research tool.” Further, defendants’ “processes of reviewing, selecting, converting, coding, linking, and identifying the documents ‘add[ed] something new, with a further purpose or different character’ than the original briefs.” The court also held that the second factor, the nature of the work, weighed in favor of fair use because the briefs were “functional presentations of law and fact” and, although technically unpublished, were “intentionally made . . . publicly available by filing them with the court.” Next, although noting that “copying the entirety of a work is sometimes necessary to make a fair use,” the court held that the third factor, the amount of work used, did not weigh for or against fair use because defendants’ copying and inclusion of the entirety of the briefs in their databases “was reasonably necessary for their transformative use.” Lastly, the court found that the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the market for the work, weighed in favor of fair use because “no potential [secondary licensing] market exists because the transactions costs in licensing attorney works would be prohibitively high” and defendants’ “usage of the briefs [was] in no way economically a substitute for the use of the briefs in their original market,” i.e., the provision of legal advice to an attorney’s clients.",Second Circuit; Textual work; Used in government proceeding; Education/Scholarship/Research,Fair use found
"Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust,",755 F.3d 87 (2d Cir. 2014),2014,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Defendants included several universities and university officials that collaborated with Google, Inc. on the Google Books project that digitized library collections. In 2008, a group of participating universities created defendant HathiTrust to be the administrative entity for the HathiTrust Digital Library (HDL). HDL is a shared digital repository. At the time of the litigation, HathiTrust’s membership included approximately eighty colleges, universities, and other nonprofit institutions. HDL contained digital copies of more than ten million works, “published over many centuries, written in a multitude of languages, [and] covering almost every subject imaginable.” HathiTrust used the digital copies (1) to create a database for full-text searching by the general public, (2) to permit library patrons with certified print disabilities to have access to full texts of works, and (3) to allow libraries to replace their original copies that were lost, destroyed, or stolen where a replacement was unobtainable at a fair price elsewhere. Plaintiffs, individual authors and authors’ associations, appealed the district court’s finding that defendants were entitled to the fair use defense.",Whether the HDL’s uses of copyrighted material are protected by fair use.,"The court held that the HDL’s first use—creation of a full-text searchable database—was fair. It found that use “quintessentially transformative” because “the result of a word search is different in purpose, character, expression, meaning, and message from the page (and the book) from which it is drawn.” The court further held that the copies were reasonably necessary to facilitate the HDL’s services to the public and to mitigate the risk of disaster or data loss. In addition, it held that the full-text search posed no harm to any existing or potential traditional market for the copyrighted works. The court also held that the second use—access for the print-disabled—was fair. It concluded that providing such access was a valid purpose under the first statutory factor, even though it was not transformative. The court held that it was reasonable for the defendants to retain both text and image copies because the text copies were required for text searching and text-to-speech capabilities, and the image copies provide an additional method by which many disabled patrons can access the works. Finally, the court held that the fourth factor favored fair use given the insignificance of the present-day market for books accessible to the handicapped. As to HDL’s use of works for preservation, the court vacated the district court’s judgment and remanded for a determination of whether the plaintiffs had standing to bring that claim.",Second Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Internet/Digitization; Textual Work,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"

Afterward, defendant Bloomberg, LP, a financial news and data reporting service, obtained a sound recording of the call without authorization and disseminated it online to paid subscribers. Plaintiff filed a claim alleging infringement of its copyright in the sound recording. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling that it was fair use for defendant to obtain and distribute the sound recording.","Whether defendant’s copying and dissemination, as part of a subscription financial news and data reporting service, of Swatch’s sound recording of a conference call with financial analysts discussing its recently released earnings report qualified as fair use.","The court held that defendant’s actions qualified as fair use. The court held that the first statutory factor favored fair use because, though defendant copied and distributed the recording without changing it, defendant’s use served the important public purpose of disseminating important financial information. The court determined that such use did not harm the copyright interests of the author, and that a use need not be transformative to be deemed “fair.” The court further held that the second factor favored fair use because plaintiff controlled the first dissemination of its company’s expression, and its copyright in the sound recording was “thin” at best. The court further held that using the recording in its entirety was reasonably necessary in light of defendant’s purpose of disseminating financial information, and that this type of use would not significantly impair the value of earnings calls nor appreciably alter incentives for creation of such original expression, especially given the fact that plaintiff conceded that they had no interest in the exploitation of the copyright-protected aspects of the work.",Second Circuit; News reporting; Unpublished,Fair use found
"Kienitz v. Sconnie Nation, LLC,",766 F.3d 756 (7th Cir. 2014) cert. denied 135 S. Ct. 1555 (2015),2014,United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois,"Plaintiff photographer Michael Kienitz owned the copyright to a 2011 photo of Madison, Wisconsin Mayor Paul Soglin. Defendant Sconnie Nation, LLC reproduced aspects of plaintiff’s photo on a small batch of t-shirts and tank tops and sold them in connection with a Madison, Wisconsin block party event. The design that appeared on the t-shirts and tank tops included a “posterized” version of plaintiff’s photograph with the background removed and the mayor’s face turned lime green. Plaintiff filed suit, claiming defendants’ unauthorized use of the photograph violated his copyright.",Whether defendants’ unauthorized reproduction of aspects of plaintiff’s photograph on a small batch of t-shirts and tank tops was fair use.,"The court found that defendants’ use was fair use. In reaching its conclusion, the court emphasized its findings that defendants’ use did not reduce the demand for plaintiff’s photograph and served as a permissible compliment, rather than a prohibited substitute, to the photograph. The court also found that the extent of defendants’ copying in relation to the whole of the copyrighted work was minimal, amounting to “a hint of [the mayor’s] smile” and “the outline of his face.”",Seventh Circuit; Photograph,Fair use found
"Richards v. Merriam Webster, Inc.,",55 F. Supp. 205 (D. Mass. 2014),2014,United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts,"Plaintiff Richards developed a “textbook dictionary” that made use of a “substantial portion” of the eleventh edition of defendant Merriam Webster, Inc.’s Collegiate Dictionary. In creating the “textbook dictionary,” plaintiff edited the format of defendant’s dictionary by changing the font, underlining certain words, redacting etymology and inserting examples of word usage. In total, plaintiff copied “about 70%” of defendant’s dictionary entries. After defendant refused to grant plaintiff permission to use its copyrighted material, plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that his use was fair use, claiming the “textbook dictionary” was “aimed at improving the reading comprehension of its users.”",Whether plaintiff’s reproduction of large portions of defendant’s copyright protected dictionary to create his own dictionary designed to improve the reading comprehension of its users was fair use.,"The court found that plaintiff’s reproduction of defendant’s dictionary was not fair use. In reaching its conclusion, the court determined that the creativity inherent in defendant’s development and editing of the original dictionary, the extent of the material plaintiff copied, and the potential effect plaintiff’s “textbook dictionary” could have on the market for defendant’s dictionary all strongly disfavored a finding of fair use. Regarding the purpose and character of plaintiff’s use, the court found that even if the “textbook dictionary” could be considered transformative, this factor alone did not make plaintiff’s proposed use permissible under the fair use doctrine.",First Circuit; Textual work,Fair use not found
"Denison v. Larkin,",64 F. Supp. 3d (N.D. Ill. 2014),2014,United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois,"Plaintiff, a licensed attorney in the state of Illinois, operated a blog on which she allegedly published false statements about judges and other lawyers. Defendants, officers of the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission (IARDC) and IARDC itself, used software provided by co- defendant Nextpoint to copy large swaths of the blog for use in disciplinary proceedings against plaintiff. Plaintiff brought an infringement action claiming that defendants infringed the copyrights in her blog posts by copying “hundreds of pages from her blog” and that IARDC improperly reproduced “15 paragraphs of text” from her blog in a complaint filed against her in a professional misconduct proceeding.",Whether it was fair use for defendants to copy large swaths of plaintiff’s blog and to reproduce specific portions of the blog for use in related disciplinary proceedings against plaintiff.,"The court ruled that defendants’ copying and reproduction of plaintiff’s blog for use in disciplinary proceedings was fair use. In reaching its conclusion, the court pointed to legislative history and Seventh Circuit precedent naming the reproduction of copyright protected works for litigation or other judicial proceedings as an example of fair use. The court also found that all four fair use factors weighed in favor of a finding of fair use.",Seventh Circuit; Internet/Digitization; Textual work; Used in government proceeding,Fair use found

Supp. 3d 359 (S.D.N.Y. 2014),2014,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff entertainment company owns the copyrights to a pornographic film titled Deep Throat. In 2013, defendant produced the film Lovelace, which is based on the biography of Linda Lovelace, the star of Deep Throat. Plaintiff alleged that three scenes in defendant’s film infringed corresponding scenes in Deep Throat.",Whether defendant’s recreation and use of three scenes from plaintiff’s copyright protected film in a new film about the star of plaintiff’s film was fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s recreation and use of three scenes from Deep Throat in a film based on the biography of Ms. Lovelace was fair use. The court found defendant’s use transformative, as it added a “new, critical perspective” on the life of Ms. Lovelace. The court also found that, despite the creative nature of Deep Throat, the defendant only copied elements of three short segments from the film and did not copy the heart of the film, which weighed in favor of a finding of fair use.",Second Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Review/Commentary,Fair use found
"Caner v. Autry,",16 F. Supp. 3d 689 (W.D. Va. 2014),2014,United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia,"Plaintiff Caner, a public figure in the evangelical Christian community, spoke and wrote to numerous audiences throughout the United States about his upbringing as a Muslim and his conversion to Christianity. In 2010, a public controversy emerged regarding the veracity of plaintiff’s description of his background. Defendant Autry posted two videos of plaintiff delivering presentations (the “Count One Video” and the “Count Two Video”) to “YouTube” and other websites. The videos allegedly supported claims that plaintiff had fabricated aspects of his background. In 2013, plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting defendant’s unauthorized copying and posting of the videos infringed his copyright in the presentations. Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming his use of the videos to comment on the veracity of plaintiff’s statements therein was fair use.",Whether reproducing a copyright-protected presentation for the purpose of commenting on the veracity of statements made in the presentation constitutes fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s use of the Count One Video was fair use, and dismissed plaintiff’s Count Two Video claim on grounds that plaintiff did not satisfy the prerequisites for filing a copyright infringement suit. Regarding the Count One Video, the court found that all four statutory fair use factors favored a finding of fair use. The court determined that the purpose of defendant’s use (to comment on the veracity of plaintiff’s statements and to “‘expose’ contradictions and ‘dishonesty’ in the testimony of a well-known evangelist”) was critical in character and sufficiently transformative to weigh in favor of fair use. The court also found that the factual nature of the work weighed in favor of fair use. Regarding the amount and substantiality of the work used, the court found that the critical nature of the use warranted reproduction of the work in its entirety. Finally, regarding the potential impact of defendant’s use on the market for the work, the court held that “[d]efendant’s use has the potential to suppress demand through forceful criticism rather than the potential to usurp demand or profit by using Plaintiff’s original work in a similar fashion. Therefore, the effect of the alleged infringement on the value of Plaintiff’s work, or on the market for that work, does not weigh against finding fair use.” (emphasis original).",Fourth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Review/Commentary,Fair use found
"Neri v. Monroe,","No. 11-cv-429-slc (W.D. Wis. Feb. 26, 2014)",2014,United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin,"Defendants Melinda Monroe, president and co-owner of the Architectural Building Arts (ABA) architectural and design firm, and others entered into an agreement with plaintiff Quincy Neri, a glass-blowing artist, to create a sculpture for an entryway ABA was designing. Plaintiff Neri installed special lighting to create spiral shadows on the ceiling and walls, which Neri contended was an integral feature of the artwork. Upon completion and installation of the sculpture, defendants photographed “before” and “after” images of the renovation with the entryway owner’s permission. Defendants used these photographs to advertise and promote their firm and as part of their application materials for “Contractor of the Year” awards. Neri brought this action, alleging that defendants had taken and displayed photographs of the sculpture without her authorization. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling in defendants’ favor to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals which remanded the case back to the district court for further consideration.",Whether defendants’ unauthorized use of photographs of plaintiff’s glass ceiling sculpture for the purposes of promoting the firm’s work constituted fair use.,"The court held that defendants’ use of the photographs constituted fair use. The court concluded that the pictures were highly transformative images of the glass ceiling because, while the sculpture was a three-dimensional, impressionistic composition used to decorate an entryway, the photographs were two-dimensional, realistic images of an interior space used to inform the public about ABA’s work. Despite the commercial nature of the photographs as advertisements and promotional tools, the court found that advertising ABA’s design and construction was a new purpose, also weighing in favor of fair use. The court concluded that the second factor favored plaintiff because the sculpture was a highly creative work. However, on the third factor, the court noted that because the sculpture was mounted onto another work, a newly constructed barrel vault ceiling specifically designed to hold the sculpture, it was therefore impossible to photograph the entire room/entryway without also including the ceiling, and that the photographs only incidentally included images of portions of the sculpture as a component of the home’s overall design scheme. Finally, the court found that no evidence existed to demonstrate that the photographs had an adverse market impact on either Neri’s ability to be commissioned for future works or to sell photographs of the sculpture.",Seventh Circuit; Photograph; Sculpture,Fair use found
"Diversey v. Schmidly,",738 F.3d 1196 (10th Cir. 2013),2013,United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit,"Plaintiff, a former graduate student at the University of New Mexico, was concerned that defendants, University faculty members and officials, did not properly review and consider his Ph.D. dissertation. Plaintiff communicated his concerns to ever higher levels of authority. The basis for plaintiff’s copyright claims arose when a university official took the dissertation copy he had given a professor and sent a copy of it to the University’s library, without plaintiff’s knowledge or consent. Two dates of particular note are: (1) plaintiff received a letter on February 7, 2008, notifying him that the University sent a copy of his dissertation to its library, which they refused to return; and (2) plaintiff learned on June 16, 2009, that the Library made the copy available to patrons. Plaintiff filed suit on June 5, 2012. The district court determined that plaintiff’s claim accrued on February 7, 2008, and the statute of limitation period elapsed by February 2011, making the June 2012 complaint untimely. Plaintiff’s action was thus barred, and the court did not conduct a fair use analysis. Plaintiff appealed.",Whether it was fair use for the University to make a copy of plaintiff’s dissertation and add it to a library collection where it was available to patrons.,"While the Tenth Circuit agreed that the statute of limitations barred plaintiff’s copying claim, it ruled that plaintiff’s distribution claim did not accrue until June 16, 2009, when he learned that the library had made the dissertation available to patrons. The court then conducted a fair use analysis with regard to the distribution claim, finding that fair use did not permit the use. The court noted that defendants’ non-commercial, educational purpose for adding the dissertation to their library was “at the heart of the protection for fair use.” But the second factor, the nature of the work, weighed in plaintiff’s favor, because the work was yet unpublished. The amount of the work used—its entirety—also weighed against a finding of fair use. Finally, while plaintiff did not argue that his work was intended for the commercial market, the court found that defendants’ listing of the work in its libraries’ catalogs nevertheless deprived plaintiff of the value of his dissertation by preventing him from effectively completing dissertation review and defense at another institution.",Tenth Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual work; Unpublished,Fair use not found

It concluded that twenty-five of the thirty works at issue constituted fair use. The court found those works transformative because defendant’s “composition, presentation, scale, color palette, and media are fundamentally different and new compared to the photographs, as is the expressive nature of [defendant’s] work.” The court also found no evidence that defendant’s work usurped either the primary or derivative market for plaintiff’s photographs. As to the other five works, the court remanded to the district court for further consideration under the proper standard.",Second Circuit; Painting/Drawing/Graphic; Photograph,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand","Plaintiff Patrick Cariou published Yes Rasta, a book of portraits and landscape photographs taken in Jamaica. Defendant Richard Prince was an appropriation artist who altered and incorporated several of plaintiff’s photographs into a series of paintings and collages called Canal Zone that was exhibited at a gallery and in the gallery’s exhibition catalog. Plaintiff filed an infringement claim, and the district court ruled in his favor, stating that to qualify as fair use, a secondary work must “comment on, relate to the historical context of, or critically refer back to the original works.” Defendant appealed."
"Bouchat v. Balt. Ravens Ltd. P’ship,",737 F.3d 932 (4th Cir. 2013),2013,United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,"Plaintiff Bouchat drew and proposed a team logo for the Baltimore Ravens. In 2000, the Fourth Circuit held that the Ravens’ use of a similar logo design between 1996 and 1998 infringed Bouchat’s copyright. In 2012, Bouchat initiated this action against the Ravens and various NFL-affiliated entities, alleging that defendants infringed his logo by using it in three videos featured on defendants’ television network and various websites and by displaying images that included the logo as part of “historical exhibits” in the Ravens’ stadium’s “Club Level” seating area. The district court ruled that defendants’ use of plaintiff’s logo in both settings was fair use. Bouchat appealed.",Whether defendants’ unauthorized use of plaintiff’s team logo artwork in historical exhibits and in three videos constituted fair use.,"Regarding the videos, the court held that defendants’ use of the logo was fair use. The court found that the use was transformative because, unlike in the highlight films at issue in Bouchat v. Balt. Ravens L.P., 619 F.3d 301 (4th Cir. 2010), the logo’s brief appearances in the three videos at issue served the transformative, historical purpose of “tell[ing] stories of past drafts, major events in Ravens history, and player careers.” The court further found that, although the work was creative in nature and used in its entirety, the “fleeting” nature of its appearances in the videos gave these factors “very little weight.” Finally, the court found that defendants’ use of the logo was unlikely to supplant any market for the original work. The court held that the use of the logo on images displayed in the Ravens’ stadium’s “Club Level” seating area was also fair use. The court found the defendants’ use transformative, as it was “designed merely to preserve a specific aspect of Ravens history.” The court also found the use to be an “incidental component” of the historical exhibits at issue. The court did not consider evidence of market harm to plaintiff, but noted that findings in plaintiff’s favor on this point would be insufficient to overcome the substantial weight of the first three fair use factors.",Fourth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Painting/Drawing/Graphic,Fair use found
"Fox Broad. Co. v. Dish Network, LLC,","723 F.3d 1067 (9th Cir. 2013) amended and reh’g en banc denied, 747 F.3d 1060 (9th Cir. 2014)",2013,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Defendant Dish Network, LLC (Dish) developed and distributed the Hopper, a digital video recorder (DVR) with video on-demand capabilities. At the same time, Dish introduced a feature called PrimeTime Anytime with AutoHop. PrimeTime Anytime allowed subscribers to set a single timer to record primetime programming on major broadcast networks, including plaintiff Fox Broadcasting Co.’s (Fox’s) programs. Dish subscribers had to enable the service, and copies were stored on the DVR for a number of days pre-selected by Dish. AutoHop allowed subscribers to automatically skip commercials, after the time points of those commercials were indexed by Dish, using “quality assurance” copies of Fox’s works. Fox alleged direct and contributory infringement, and the district court denied Fox a preliminary injunction because it had not established a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims. Fox appealed.","Whether the copying and storage for later use of Fox programming, as facilitated by Dish Network’s PrimeTime Anytime service, constituted fair use.","First, the appeals court held that Dish was not directly liable for their customers’ copying and storage of Fox’s programming. Then, relying heavily on Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 (1984), the court held that Dish was not secondarily liable because Dish customers’ use of PrimeTime Anytime to copy television programing was fair use. Rejecting plaintiff’s assertion that the copying was done for library-building, the court found that PrimeTime Anytime was used for time-shifting for private home use and was a noncommercial, nonprofit activity under Sony. It also found that Dish customers engaged in time-shifting of programs that they had already been invited to view in their entirety, free of charge. Therefore, the fact that customers copied entire programs did not weigh against a finding of fair use. The “market harm” analysis differed slightly from that of Sony because a secondary market existed for Fox’s programming through licenses with distributors such as Hulu and Apple, while no such market existed in Sony. However, the court still found that there was no harm, noting that Fox often charged no additional fee for providers to offer its programming on demand.",Ninth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Format shifting/Space Shifting; Internet/Digitization,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
"Seltzer v. Green Day, Inc.,",725 F.3d 1170 (9th Cir. 2013),2013,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiff Derek Seltzer alleged that defendants infringed Scream Icon, his drawing of a screaming, contorted face that appeared as street art in Los Angeles and elsewhere. Defendant Roger Staub, a photographer and video designer, photographed Scream Icon on a brick wall in Los Angeles. Staub then incorporated a slightly modified version of the image into a video backdrop that was prominently featured during several concerts for defendant rock band, Green Day. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling in defendants’ favor.",Whether a rock band’s unauthorized use of an artist’s illustration in the video backdrop of a stage show was fair use.,"The court held that the band’s use of Scream Icon was fair use. The court found the use transformative because defendants’ used the original as “raw material” in the construction of a four-minute video backdrop in a way that was not simply a quotation or republication of Scream Icon. The court further held that defendants’ modifications to the image conveyed new information, aesthetics, insights, and understandings distinct from the original piece. The court also held that the prior public dissemination of the illustration—via plaintiff’s wide dissemination of the image as street art—weighed in favor of fair use and that defendants’ use of the drawing was not excessive in light of its transformative purpose. Finally, the court found that the use did not affect the value of the illustration or of plaintiff’s artwork in general.",Ninth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Painting/Drawing/Graphic; Photograph,Fair use found
"SOFA Entm’t, Inc. v. Dodger Prods., Inc.,",709 F.3d 1273 (9th Cir. 2013),2013,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Defendants, Dodger Productions, Inc. and Dodgers Theatricals, Ltd., produced Jersey Boys, a musical stage dramatization based on the 1960s rock and roll band the Four Seasons. Plaintiff, SOFA Entertainment, Inc. owns the rights for the entire run of The Ed Sullivan Show, a television program that ran from 1948-1971, and included a Four Season’s performance on January 2, 1966. Defendants’ musical includes seven seconds of an unlicensed clip from that episode showing the host, Ed Sullivan, introducing the Four Seasons. After the clip is shown, the actors in the musical launch into a Four Seasons song. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling that defendants’ use of the clip was fair.",Whether defendants’ unauthorized use of the seven-second clip from The Ed Sullivan Show in the musical Jersey Boys was fair use.,"The court held that defendants’ reproduction of the clip was fair. In its analysis, the court found that defendants’ use of the clip as a “biographical anchor” to mark an historical point in the Four Seasons’ career was transformative. The court further found that its use conveyed “mainly factual information” regarding who was about to perform on The Ed Sullivan Show and was not “qualitatively significant” for the same reason. Finally, the court held that defendants’ use of the clip in the musical advanced “its own original creation without any reasonable threat to SOFA’s business model” and did so without “usurping whatever demand there is for the original clip.” The court reasoned that Jersey Boys was not a substitute for The Ed Sullivan Show—the short clip only appeared once in the musical—and the musical was not reproduced on DVD, so viewers could not view the clip repeatedly.",Ninth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual,Fair use found
"Morris v. Guetta,","No. LA CV12-00684 JAK (RZX) (C.D. Cal. Feb. 4, 2013)",2013,United States District Court for the Central District of California,"Plaintiff Dennis Morris alleged that defendant Thierry Guetta infringed his 1977 photograph of Sid Vicious, former bassist for the Sex Pistols. Defendant was an “appropriation artist” who created pop art pieces that included modified pictures of celebrities. Defendant incorporated plaintiff’s photo into seven pieces of artwork by altering the photo in different ways, such as changing the color contrast and adding colors or other visual elements.",Whether defendant’s unauthorized incorporation of plaintiff’s photograph into art pieces constituted fair use.,"The court granted plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of copyright infringement. The court found that defendant’s use did not constitute fair use because the alterations were not sufficiently transformative. The court found that the changes did not add something new, have a further purpose, or give the photos a different character than the original, with new expression, meaning, or message. As to the second factor, the court found plaintiff’s photograph to be marginally creative, although it was more documentary than aesthetic, weighing slightly against a finding of fair use. For amount and substantiality of the portion used, because defendant relied on and used the photograph itself to create the artworks, the court found this factor weighed against fair use. Finally, on the fourth factor, though the court found that there was no clear harm to the market for, or value of, the photograph, it determined that even a lack of harm would not excuse an unjustified use.",Ninth Circuit; Painting/Drawing/Graphic; Photograph,Fair use not found

Defendant, law firm Schwegman, Lundberg & Woessner, P.A., downloaded, stored, copied, and distributed eighteen of plaintiff’s articles in connection with the patent application process, namely to comply with the duty to disclose prior art under patent law. Defendant obtained the articles from a few sources, including a United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database that contained articles that are material to patentability claims. Defendant paid no license fees to plaintiff, nor did defendant obtain permission from plaintiff to copy the articles. Plaintiff claimed that defendant infringed its copyrights by “downloading, storing, making internal copies of, and distributing” the journal articles. Defendant claimed this was fair use. USPTO intervened as an intervenor defendant.","Whether obtaining, storing, copying, and distributing copyrighted publications for use in the patent application process, without a license or other permission, constituted fair use.","The court held that defendant’s use of plaintiff’s publications was fair use. The court found the use transformative because it had a different intrinsic purpose than was intended by plaintiff: plaintiff used the journal articles to inform the scientific community. Defendant, however, used the articles to inform a government agency about a patent claim. The court also found that plaintiff failed to present evidence that the defendant’s use of the articles would adversely affect plaintiff’s “traditional target market” for the articles. Finally, because the articles were “factual or informational” in nature, the court found that defendant’s use of the full articles was “necessary to the new and different purpose for which [they] made the copies.” This weighed in favor of finding fair use.",Eighth Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual work; Used in government proceeding,Fair use found
"Faulkner Literary Rights, LLC v. Sony Pictures Classics, Inc.,",953 F. Supp. 2d 701 (N.D. Miss. 2013),2013,United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi,"Defendant Sony Pictures Classics, Inc. owned the film rights for Midnight In Paris (MIP), in which one of the characters said: “The past is not dead. Actually, it’s not even past. You know who said that? Faulkner, and he was right.” Plaintiff Faulkner Literary Rights, LLC, representing the estate of famed author William Faulkner, alleged that the lines infringed Faulkner’s book Requiem for a Nun (RFN) in which he wrote, “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”",Whether paraphrasing a line from a full-length novel in a full-length film constituted copyright infringement.,"The court held that defendant’s use of the RFN quote in MIP qualified as fair use. The court initially considered the issue of de minimis copying but determined that, absent specific Fifth Circuit guidance, it is best incorporated into the fair use analysis. In conducting a fair use analysis, the court found that the two quotations took place in completely different contexts in their respective works, and that defendant’s use was so transformative that it “diminishe[d] the significance of considerations such as commercial use that would tip to the detriment of fair use.” The court also held that, because the quote at issue (nine words in two sentences) was of “miniscule quantitative importance” to RFN as a whole, the quantitative and qualitative analysis tipped in favor of fair use. Finally, the court expressed significant skepticism that defendant’s use harmed any relevant potential market for RFN, as it was a “flattering and artful use of literally allusion.”",Fifth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Textual work,Fair use found
"Associated Press v. Meltwater U.S. Holdings, Inc.,",931 F. Supp. 2d 537 (S.D.N.Y. 2013),2013,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff Associated Press (AP), a news cooperative owned by over 1,400 newspapers across the United States, issued up to 2,000 news articles daily. Defendant Meltwater News U.S. Holdings, Inc. (Meltwater) offered a news monitoring service to subscribers, such as nonprofits, government agencies, and corporations. Meltwater used an automated system that would “crawl” the Internet daily for news on approximately 162,000 selected websites and created an index of the content (much like a search engine). Meltwater also allowed customers to do ad hoc searches, news feeds, and archiving. AP alleged that Meltwater’s service infringed its copyrights by delivering excerpts from thirty-three AP articles to Meltwater customers. AP showed that it owned a valid copyright in the articles and that Meltwater had copied protected elements of those works. Meltwater did not contest AP’s showing, and relied instead on five affirmative defenses, including fair use. The parties cross-moved for summary judgment.","Whether operating a service that allows users to search and archive copyrighted news articles, as well as providing excerpts of them, qualified as fair use.","The court rejected Meltwater’s fair use defense and granted AP’s motion for summary judgment, with one exception not relevant to the fair use analysis. Regarding the purpose prong of the fair use analysis, the court determined that Meltwater’s use was not transformative. Meltwater merely automatically captured and republished segments of text from the articles without adding commentary or insight. Furthermore, Meltwater copied the content to make money from the undiluted use of the material, and so commercial profit was “not an incidental consequence of the use to which it puts the copyrighted material.” That the works were factual in nature and were already published weighed slightly in favor of finding fair use. The amount and substantiality of the portion used weighed strongly against a finding of fair use. Meltwater took between 4.5% and 61% of the articles, including the introduction section (“lede”) of each story, which was “meant to convey the heart of the story.” The fourth factor, the effect on the market, also weighed strongly against Meltwater. AP had already established a market for licensing its work, and Meltwater refused to purchase licenses. Meltwater also directly competed with AP for customers, and so through its refusal to pay the fees, the court reasoned, Meltwater obtained an unfair commercial advantage and directly harmed AP as creator of the content.",Second Circuit; Format shifting/Space shifting; News reporting,Fair use not found
"Soc’y of the Holy Transfiguration Monestary, Inc. v. Gregory,",689 F.3d 29 (1st Cir. 2012),2012,United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit,"Plaintiff Society of the Holy Transfiguration Monastery, Inc. owns English translations of seven ancient Greek religious texts, some of which were unpublished. Plaintiff distributed copies of the translations to other parishes that used them for liturgies conducted in English. Defendant Archbishop Gregory, a former member of the monastery, posted a portion of the translations on his website. The Archbishop appealed the district court’s ruling against finding fair use.",Whether defendant’s posting on his website of plaintiff’s English translations of ancient religious texts constituted fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s unauthorized reproduction was not a fair use. The court did not find his reproduction to be transformative because it was “essentially verbatim or near-verbatim copies” of plaintiff’s works, and his use was for the same purpose and benefit as the original works—to further religious practice and education. For the same reason, the court found that defendant’s use was likely to harm the potential market value for the works. Further, the court found that if such use was deemed fair, the market for translations of ancient religious texts would be affected, and institutions would be discouraged from investing resources in creating such works, rendering ancient texts inaccessible to potential users. Noting that the commercial-noncommercial distinction in a fair use analysis is not only limited to financial gain, the court also found that defendant benefited by providing the works to the public and gaining “at least some recognition” in the religious community for providing electronic access to translations of the ancient works.

LFP, Inc.,",691 F.3d 747 (6th Cir. 2012),2012,United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,"Plaintiff, a female television news anchor, alleged that defendant LFP (Larry Flynt Publications), Inc., owner of the adult magazine Hustler, infringed her copyright in a photograph. In 2003, without plaintiff’s knowledge, an amateur photographer took photos of her on vacation while she was taking part in a wet t-shirt contest and dancing nude. After the photographer posted the photos on the internet and plaintiff lost her job, plaintiff acquired the copyrights to the photos and registered them with the Copyright Office in 2004. Hustler published one of the copyright protected photos in a 2006 issue of its magazine, the subject of this lawsuit. Defendant allegedly searched unsuccessfully to identify the copyright owner and was advised by legal counsel that publication without authorization was fair use. LFP appealed the jury’s verdict of liability.",Whether defendant’s unauthorized publication of plaintiff’s copyright- protected photograph constituted fair use.,"The appeals court held that the jury reasonably determined that publication of the photograph was not fair use. The court found that the photograph was used for the commercial purpose of selling magazines. The court further found that the publication was not transformative in any way because defendant did not alter or add any meaning or message to the photograph. The court then found that defendant had published the entire photograph with minimal editing, weighing against a finding of fair use. The court rejected defendant’s argument that plaintiff had no intention of marketing the work to the public and therefore no market harm existed. Instead, it found that, despite plaintiff’s intentions not to use or market the work, defendant’s commercial use had a negative effect on any potential market for plaintiff’s work.",Sixth Circuit; Photograph,Fair use not found
"Brownmark Films, LLC v. Comedy Partners,",682 F.3d 687 (7th Cir. 2012),2012,United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,"Defendants Comedy Partners created the comic animated television show South Park about “the adventures of foul-mouthed fourth graders in the small town of South Park, Colorado.” As a humorous commentary on and critique of the internet viral video concept, defendants produced an animated version of plaintiff Brownmark Films’ popular internet music video that featured a man singing and dancing in tight pants. The district court stated that only a “fleeting glance” was needed to realize that defendants’ use of plaintiff’s video was meant to “lampoon the recent craze in our society of watching video clips on the internet … in other words, fair use.” Plaintiff appealed.",Whether defendants’ animated parody version of plaintiff’s popular internet video was fair use.,"Agreeing with the lower court, the Seventh Circuit found this to be an “obvious case of fair use.” In particular, the court found that the parodic use at issue was transformative, and that the defendants’ video was “clearly a parody and has not supplanted the original.” Regarding the market for plaintiff’s video, the court found that the plaintiff failed to provide any evidence of market harm, and noted that the likely effect of the defendants’ video, “ironically, would only increase … revenue.”",Seventh Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Parody/Satire,Fair use found
"Monge v. Maya Magazines, Inc.,",688 F.3d 1164 (9th Cir. 2012),2012,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiffs, Latin American celebrities Noelia Lorenzo Monge and Jorge Reynoso, went to great lengths to keep their marriage secret, taking only a few unpublished photographs of their wedding. More than a year later, their chauffeur found a memory chip containing the photos in a car ashtray. After failing to extort money from plaintiffs for return of the memory chip, the chauffeur sold the photos to defendant Maya Magazines, Inc. which published them in a celebrity gossip magazine. Plaintiffs appealed the district court’s ruling that it was fair use for defendant to publish the photos.",Whether defendant’s publication of previously unpublished photographs in a celebrity gossip magazine constitutes fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s wholesale, commercial use of the previously unpublished photos was not fair use. Acknowledging that defendant’s sensational coverage of the wedding was newsworthy, the court nonetheless determined that the use of the photos was only marginally transformative, as neither minor cropping nor adding headlines and captions transformed the works, and such use was undisputedly commercial. Additionally, the court stressed that newsworthiness itself does not make a use transformative. Addressing the nature of the copyrighted work, the court found that although the point-and-shoot images were not highly artistic, they were not entirely factual either, weighing against fair use. Further, the court found the unpublished nature of the works was a key factor, also weighing against a finding of fair use. The amount and substantiality of the used portion weighed additionally against fair use because the court found that the “heart” of each picture was published. Finally, the court found that an actual market for celebrity wedding photos existed, given that both parties engaged in the purchase and sale of such works, and that the potential market for these particular photos was “substantially harmed” by defendant’s unauthorized first publication.",Ninth Circuit; News reporting; Photograph; Unpublished,Fair use not found

Sept. 14, 2012)",2012,United States District Court for the Central District of California,"Defendant Riverside Films, LLC produced Sholem Aleichem: Laughing in the Darkness, a feature length documentary about the life of a 19th Century Yiddish author and, more broadly, Jewish history. Plaintiff National Center for Jewish Film (NCJF) alleged that defendant infringed its copyrights by using film clips from four of its films without permission, including Yiddle with His Fiddle, A Letter to Mother, Tevye the Milkman and Jewish Luck.",Whether defendant’s unauthorized use in its documentary film of four clips taken from plaintiff’s films was fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s use of the clips from the NCJF films was fair use. The court found defendant’s use to be transformative because it combined the NCJF clips with other clips and added scholarly commentary that amounted to “more than mere narration.” The court also determined that the NCJF clips were old and tentatively in the public domain, weighing in favor of fair use. The court also found that the portion of plaintiff’s films that defendant reproduced was acceptable because the use was both quantitatively (only a maximum of 1.5% percent of each of the films) and qualitatively minimal (the clips did not include the heart of the works). Lastly, the court held that defendant’s use would not have an effect on the market for plaintiff’s films as “the [c]ourt is unconvinced that the use of the copyrighted clips . . . would dissuade consumers from patronizing the original full-length films.”",Ninth Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Film/Audiovisual,Fair use found
"Northland Family Planning Clinic, Inc. v. Ctr. for Bio-Ethical Reform,",868 F. Supp. 2d 962 (C.D. Cal. 2012),2012,United States District Court for the Central District of California,"Plaintiff Northland Family Planning Clinic (NFPC) produced videos for the purpose of “outreach, counseling, and education in an effort to de-stigmatize abortion.” Defendant Center for Bio-Ethical Reform (CBR) took NFPC clips and narration to use in their own videos, juxtaposed with graphic images of abortion procedures and aborted fetuses, and distributed their videos online.",Whether it was fair use for CBR to use clips from NFPC videos in its own videos.,"The court held that CBR’s use of the NFPC videos was fair use. It found that the CBR video was a transformative parody that commented on the NFPC videos. While the NFPC videos were “informational, functional, and creative,” the court found this weighed only slightly in favor of plaintiff because it determined that this factor was not “terribly significant” when considering fair use, particularly in the context of parody. The court also determined that, as a parody, the CBR video had more leeway regarding the substantiality and amount of the original work used, and that CBR used no more than necessary to convey its message. Lastly, the court found that there would be no cognizable harm to the market for the original videos as a result of CBR’s use, clarifying the difference between “biting criticism that merely suppresses demand and copyright infringement, which usurps it.”",Ninth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Parody/Satire,Fair use found
"Murphy v. Millennium Radio Grp. L.L.C.,",650 F.3d 295 (3d Cir. 2011),2011,United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit,"Plaintiff Peter Murphy photographed two radio show hosts for local radio station WKXW, which was owned by defendant Millennium Radio Group, LLC. Plaintiff authorized New Jersey Magazine to use the photograph in a “Best of New Jersey” article that named the two hosts the “best shock jocks” in New Jersey. After the article’s publication in New Jersey Magazine, an unknown WKXW employee scanned the photograph, removed references to the “Best of New Jersey” article and other identifying information from the photograph, posted the modified version of the photograph on the WKXW website, and invited users to send WKXW photo-manipulated versions of the photograph. WKXW posted twenty-six photo-manipulated submissions on its website. Plaintiff alleged that defendants Millennium Radio Group and the two radio show hosts infringed his copyright in the photograph. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s judgment in favor of defendants.",Whether it was fair use for defendants to post plaintiff’s photograph on its website without permission and invite website guests to create derivative works using photo-manipulation software.,"The court held that defendants’ unauthorized use of plaintiff’s photograph did not constitute fair use. The court rejected defendants’ argument that their use was transformative because it qualified as “news reporting” by using the image to report news of the award to the WKXW radio show hosts. The court reasoned that defendants’ use of the photograph in no way commented or critiqued the original, but merely amounted to an appropriation of the photograph to illustrate their announcement. The court also found that the use was essentially to promote the show, which was commercial in nature. The court then determined that defendants’ use adversely impacted the plaintiff’s market. Though defendants sought to persuade the court that because the radio hosts no longer worked as a team, the marketable nature of the photograph’s story in the magazine article was fleeting, the court considered that to be a speculative claim and noted that defendants must have valued the photograph enough to use it on the WKXW website. The court also found that both the creative nature of the work and the fact that the image was copied in its entirety weighed against a finding of fair use.",Third Circuit; News reporting; Photograph,Fair use not found
"Friedman v. Guetta,","No. CV 10-00014 DDP (JCx) (C.D. Cal. May 27, 2011)",2011,United States District Court for the Central District of California,"In 1985, plaintiff Glen Friedman took a photograph of members of the famous hip-hop music group Run-DMC wearing Stetson hats. In 1994, he published this photo in a book titled Fuck You Heroes. Defendant Thierry Guetta, an artist, downloaded the photo from the internet and incorporated parts of the image into four visual artworks that he publicly displayed and offered for sale.",Whether defendant’s copying and incorporation of plaintiff’s photograph into his own artwork constituted fair use.,"The court ruled that defendant’s use of plaintiff’s photograph was not a fair use. In reaching its determination, the court held that incorporating the Friedman photograph into defendant’s artwork was not distinct enough to be transformative. The court additionally held that defendant’s use of substantial portions of the original photograph, namely Run-DMC’s faces, weighed against a finding of fair use. Lastly, the court found that defendant’s use had a negative impact on the potential market for the original work because it competed directly with plaintiff’s own commercial and artistic use.",Ninth Circuit; Photograph,Fair use not found

CIO is a “nonprofit organization dedicated to helping immigrants become aware of immigration-related issues.” After the Las Vegas Review-Journal (LVRJ) published an article on whether police were targeting minorities, defendants posted the article in its entirety on the CIO website. LVRJ subsequently assigned the copyright in the article to plaintiff Righthaven, LLC, which accused defendants of copyright infringement.",Whether CIO’s unauthorized publication of the LVRJ article on its website was fair use of Righthaven’s copyright in the article.,"The court held that CIO’s use of the article was fair. The court found that CIO’s noncommercial use of the informational article to educate the public was transformative and did not constitute a substitution of Righthaven’s use. The court also found that, although CIO posted the work in its entirety, the amount used was reasonable in light of the informational purpose of the use. Lastly, the court found that Righthaven had failed to show that CIO’s use of the article resulted in any market harm or a reduction in the value of Righthaven’s copyright in the article.",Ninth Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Internet/Digitization; News reporting; Textual work,Fair use found
"CCA and B, LLC v. F + W Media, Inc.,",819 F. Supp. 2d 1310 (N.D. Ga. 2011),2011,United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia,"Plaintiff CCA and B published a book titled The Elf on the Shelf (Elf On), a popular children’s Christmas story that sold 1.5 million copies. The story depicted Santa monitoring who had been naughty or nice by sending out scout elves to observe broken rules and small acts of kindness. Defendant F + W Media published a book called The Elf off the Shelf (Elf Off), which had a relatively raunchy elf narrator who used somewhat crude language, drank spiked eggnog, tried to woo Barbie while Ken was away, and watched pornography. The elf in Elf Off described himself as a “discount elf,” having been “sprung” from a discounted copy of Elf On. The books’ covers and jackets look relatively similar. Plaintiff alleged that defendant infringed its various copyright interests by spinning off the Elf On storyline and using similar images. Defendant argued that the book qualified as fair use because it was a parody.","Whether a story that used similar images, but a debauched version of character, from a children’s story constituted fair use as a parody.","The court held that the defendant’s use of plaintiff’s work was a fair use. The court found that Elf Off clearly served a commercial purpose, but this did not weigh heavily against defendant because the parody was directed to the underlying work. Furthermore, the court determined that Elf Off made a transformative use of the Elf On doll and images because it depicted the elf in an unromantic setting to demystify the magic of the Elf On elf. Regarding the nature of the use, the court held that the factor was neutral when the use was parody. The court also found that parodies required taking enough identifiable elements (essentially the heart) of the original to effectively comment on the original work. Therefore, the court held that the borrowed and modified elements were reasonable. Finally, there was no evidence that Elf Off affected the market for Elf On, and the court found it unlikely that someone would substitute the age-inappropriate Elf Off for the original children’s story.",Eleventh Circuit; Parody/Satire; Textual work,Fair use found
"Salinger v. Colting,",607 F.3d 68 (2d Cir. 2010),2010,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff, famed American author J.D. Salinger, alleged that defendant’s book infringed his well-known novel The Catcher in the Rye, published in 1951. Salinger alleged that the works had “extensive similarities,” including characters, structure, and scenes. Defendant, a Swedish author using the pen name John David California, released 60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye (60 Years Later) in England on May 9, 2009, and set its U.S. publication date for September 15, 2009. 60 Years Later featured a ninety-year-old fictionalized Salinger character that is haunted by a seventy-six-year-old version of Salinger’s Holden Caulfield character. Defendant argued that there were significant differences between the books and that he did not intend his to be a sequel to The Catcher in the Rye. Rather, he argued it was a commentary and critique that reflected on aspects of Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye, such as Salinger’s relationship as author to the book and to the Caulfield character. Salinger sued plaintiff in district court seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent defendant from publishing, advertising, or distributing his book in the U.S. Defendant appealed the district court’s grant of the injunction.",Whether Salinger was likely to prevail on the merits of his argument that defendant’s book was substantially similar to The Catcher in the Rye and that defendant’s use of elements of his work was not a fair use.,"The court vacated the preliminary injunction and remanded the case for further proceedings because the district court erred by not applying the correct equitable standard. Regarding “fair use,” however, the court determined that the district court did not err in finding defendant was not likely to succeed in asserting a fair use defense. The court agreed with the district court’s focus on the “purpose and character of the use” and gave significant weight to its finding that defendant’s assertion that his primary purpose was to use elements of The Catcher in the Rye to critique Salinger and his persona was not credible.",Second Circuit; Parody/Satire; Review/Commentary; Textual work,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
"Bouchat v. Balt. Ravens Ltd. P’ship,",619 F.3d 301 (4th Cir. 2010),2010,United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,"Plaintiff Bouchat drew and proposed a team logo for the Baltimore Ravens. In 2000, the Fourth Circuit held that the Ravens’ use of a similar logo design between 1996 and 1998 infringed Bouchat’s copyright. In 2008, Bouchat initiated this action against the Ravens and various NFL-affiliated entities, alleging that defendants infringed his logo by using it in a Ravens corporate lobby display and in highlight reels from the 1996-1998 season, shot when the team had used the logo previously found to be infringing, and not since re- edited. The district court ruled that both uses were fair use. Bouchat appealed.",Whether defendants’ unauthorized use of plaintiff’s team logo artwork in its corporate lobby and in highlight reels of past games constituted fair use.,"Regarding the 1996-1998 highlight reels, the court held that defendants’ use of the logo was not fair use. The court found that the use was not transformative because the logo’s appearance in the highlight films served the same purpose of identifying the Ravens that it did when defendants first infringed Bouchat’s copyright. That the artwork was creative in nature and was used in its entirety in the films also weighed against fair use. Finally, the market effect of the use weighed against fair use, given that licensing of the logo during the 1996-1998 seasons constituted a potential market for the logo, and a market also existed for licensing historic logos. The court held that the use of the logo on memorabilia displayed in the corporate lobby was fair use. The lobby was dedicated to illustrating the team’s history and was open to the public free of charge, and the court likened this to “fair use of a work for teaching, . . . scholarship, or research.” The court also found that the nature of the use was non-commercial. As to the amount, it would not have been possible to achieve the transformative purpose of exhibiting memorabilia from past seasons without using the entire work. Finally, plaintiff had offered no evidence of market harm as a result of the display, which weighed in favor of fair use.",Fourth Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Film/Audiovisual; Painting/Drawing/Graphic,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
"Henley v. DeVore,",733 F. Supp. 2d 1144 (C.D. Cal. 2010),2010,United States District Court for the Central District of California,"Plaintiffs Don Henley and other songwriters owned copyrights in the songs The Boys of Summer and All She Wants to Do Is Dance. Defendants Charles DeVore, a candidate for the U.S. Senate, and Justin Hart, a member of DeVore’s campaign staff, recorded versions of The Boys of Summer and All She Wants to Do Is Dance with some of the lyrics changed to lampoon politicians Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi (The Hope of November) as well as Barbara Boxer (All She Wants to Do Is Tax). Defendants used the alleged parodies in political videos that were released on YouTube. After unsuccessful attempts to stop defendants from using the alleged parodies, including sending DMCA takedown notices, plaintiffs filed suit for copyright infringement.",Whether defendants’ alleged parodies of plaintiffs’ songs used in political videos constituted fair use.,"The court held defendants’ repurposing of the Boys of Summer and All She Wants to Do Is Dance was not a fair use. Regarding The Hope of November, the court assumed that “parody-of-the- author” was a legitimately transformative use and found that the song’s “implicit targeting of Henley” caused the first fair use factor to weigh slightly in defendants’ favor. Nevertheless, after weighing all four factors, the court held they did not support a finding of fair use. Specifically, the court found that defendants used the song for a commercial purpose to encourage campaign contributions, used an amount of the song that went “far beyond” what was necessary to convey allegedly parodic points about Henley, and used the song in a way that could potentially diminish the market for plaintiffs to license the songs. Regarding All She Wants to Do Is Tax, the court found that all four factors weighed against a finding of fair use. Specifically, the court found that the song did not constitute a parody, that defendants used the song for a commercial purpose, that defendants used a substantial portion of the song, and that defendants used the song in a way that could potentially diminish the market for plaintiffs to license the songs.",Ninth Circuit; Music; Parody/Satire,Fair use not found

The Las Vegas Review-Journal (LVRJ) published a newspaper article that featured a mix of commentary and factual reporting about the Las Vegas housing market. After the article appeared in LVRJ, defendant copied the first eight of thirty sentences from the article and posted them on his blog. The portion defendant used on his blog contained only factual reporting. After the quoted portion appeared on defendant’s blog, LVRJ assigned the copyright to plaintiff Righthaven, LLC.",Whether defendant’s unauthorized use of eight factual sentences from a news story constituted fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s use was a fair use. It found that, while educational, defendant’s use was primarily commercial, which weighed against fair use. However, the court further found that the value of the original work was primarily in the LVRJ’s commentary rather than the eight sentences of fact-based reporting. As such, the court determined that defendant’s use of only the factual aspects of the article was not likely to impact the value of the original article. Ultimately, the court ruled that the weighing of all four factors supported a finding of fair use.",Ninth Circuit; Internet/Digitization; News reporting; Textual work,Fair use found
"Gaylord v. United States,",595 F.3d 1364 (Fed.

Defendant the U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Korean War armistice that included a picture showing 14 of the 19 soldier statues. Plaintiff appealed the Federal Claims Court ruling that defendant was not liable because the Post Office made fair use of plaintiff’s work.",Whether the U.S. Postal Service’s unauthorized use of an image of plaintiff’s sculpture on a stamp was fair use.,"The appellate court held that putting an image of plaintiff’s sculpture on a stamp without permission was not fair use. Though the stamp altered colors and added snow, the court did not find it transformative because it shared a common purpose with the memorial—to honor Korean War veterans. The court found that the stamp also had a clearly commercial purpose in light of the fact that defendant received over $17 million from sales. The court pointed out that the nature of The Column, being expressive and creative, and the amount of the memorial depicted—fourteen of the nineteen soldier sculptures—weighed against fair use. The court, however, noted that defendant’s work harmed neither the value of plaintiff’s work nor the market for derivatives based on this work, analogizing the stamp to the thumbnail images in Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp., 336 F.3d 811 (2003). Nonetheless, the court determined that this was not enough to overcome the other factors that weighed against a fair use finding.",Federal Circuit; Sculpture,Fair use not found
"A.V. ex rel. Vanderhye v. iParadigms, L.L.C.,",562 F.3d 630 (4th Cir. 2009),2009,United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,"Defendant iParadigms, LLC offered subscriptions to a computerized system called Turnitin Plagiarism Detection Service (Turnitin) that enabled schools to monitor for plagiarism by digitally comparing student work. Schools could elect to archive student work in Turnitin’s database for continued use in these digital comparisons. Plaintiffs, high school students, claimed that archiving their schoolwork without their permission infringed their copyrights in those works. The district court ruled that such archiving did not infringe plaintiffs’ copyrights and constituted fair use. Plaintiffs appealed.",Whether unauthorized digital archiving of student papers for purposes of preventing plagiarism constituted fair use.,"The appeals court upheld the district court: archiving student work for the purpose of detecting plagiarism constituted fair use. It deemed the use transformative because it was unrelated to the works’ expressive content and was instead aimed at detecting and discouraging plagiarism. The court further held that the use did not undermine plaintiffs’ right of first publication, because iParadigms did not publicly disseminate the works or make them available to any third party except the school. Finally, regarding the effect on the market for student papers, the court found that Turnitin did not create a market substitute for the papers. It did suppress demand for reuse of the papers by later students, but copyright law does not protect against this kind of harm.",Fourth Circuit; Computer program; Education/Scholarship/Research; Internet/Digitization; Textual work,Fair use found
"Reyes v. Wyeth Pharm., Inc.,",603 F. Supp. 2d 289 (D.P.R. 2009),2009,United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico,"Plaintiff Martha Reyes was a sculptor who created a glass sculpture entitled The Watcher of Fire (The Watcher). Defendants, including Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc., were conducting an ongoing public health service campaign to educate the public about living a healthy life and the risks of certain ailments. The campaign was widely promoted in many different media formats and outlets. In connection with the campaign, defendants used an unauthorized photograph of The Watcher in an advertisement designed to raise awareness of rheumatoid arthritis. The advertisement depicted plaintiff’s sculpture in combination with informational text, corporate logos, and advertising slogans.",Whether defendants’ unauthorized use of a photo of plaintiff’s sculpture in an advertisement was fair use.,"The court held that defendants’ use of a photo of the sculpture did not qualify as fair use. In reaching its conclusion, the court relied on its findings that defendants’ use of the work was minimally transformative; that defendants’ advertisement included a depiction of almost the entire work; and that defendants’ unauthorized use of the work in advertisements could destroy the market for plaintiff to sell or license her sculpture for use in advertisements.",First Circuit; Photograph; Sculpture,Fair use not found
"Blackwell Publ’g, Inc. v. Excel Research Grp., LLC,",661 F. Supp. 2d 786 (E.D. Mich. 2009),2009,United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan,"Plaintiffs, major publishing houses, alleged that defendant Excel Research Group, LLC’s computerized copy shop infringed their copyrights in thirty- three works. Defendants obtained course materials directly from professors and copied those materials to create “coursepacks,” which were offered to students at a price much lower than that of the separate publications. Defendants’ unique business model also enabled it to charge less than traditional copy shops and the university’s photocopy machines. Students would make the copies themselves, using Excel’s “master” copy and Excel’s machines. Students would fill out a declaration reading, “I am a student in this class and am making a copy for educational purposes.” Excel paid no licensing fees for the material. The publishers filed a motion for partial summary judgment.","Whether the copying of coursepacks, as performed by students and facilitated by defendants’ maintenance and lending of the master copies, constituted a fair use.","The court held that defendants’ use of the protected material was not fair and granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs. In reaching its decision, the court relied on its findings that the purpose of defendants’ use was to facilitate the operation of a “for-profit commercial business.” The court also determined that the thirty-three works included in the coursepacks, as selected by professors, were qualitatively significant even though only the necessary amount of the work was reproduced. Finally, the court found that defendants’ use had an adverse impact on the marketplace for the works because defendants were able to charge less than competitors for coursepacks, given that they did not pay a licensing fee to plaintiffs.",Sixth Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual work,Fair use not found

Defendant J. David Spurlock published Famous Monster Movie Art of Basil Gogos, a biographical book that chronicled Gogos’ life and artwork. Plaintiff alleged that defendant’s book, which included twenty-four images of cover art that originally appeared on the covers of plaintiff’s magazines, infringed its copyrights in the magazines.",Whether it was fair use for defendant to reproduce plaintiff’s magazine cover artwork in a biography detailing the career of the artist who created it.,"The court held that defendant’s use of artwork to illustrate a biographical work about the artist constituted fair use. The court favored a finding of fair use despite its determination that a genuine issue of fact remained regarding whether defendant’s use would have a commercial impact on the value of the copyrighted works. The court further determined that defendant’s use of the artwork to illustrate a particular stage of Gogos’ career was transformative, considering plaintiff had originally used the artwork for purposes related to the advertising and sale of magazines. The court also determined that the cover artwork only constituted a small percentage of the protected original works (one page out of each magazine issue’s 68 to 100 pages) and that the artwork did not comprise the “heart” of the works in question.",Third Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Painting/Drawing/Graphic; Textual work,Fair use found

In response to plaintiff’s allegations of infringement, defendant argued the purpose of the broadcast was criticism, comment or news reporting.","Whether defendant’s unauthorized reproduction of portions of plaintiff’s song, allegedly for the purpose of criticism and comment, was fair use.","The court held that defendant’s use of Rocky Top was not a fair use. In reaching its conclusion, the court determined that including the clip in the football montage was not transformative because defendant’s broadcast did not comment on or discuss the work itself. The court also found that the creative nature of Rocky Top weighed against a finding of fair use. Lastly, the court determined that defendant failed to carry its burden of showing that there was no negative effect on the potential market for Rocky Top and concluded that plaintiff’s ability to license the song was harmed.",Sixth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Music; Textual work,Fair use not found

The court determined that the previews were not a transformative use because they are exact copies of the music and did nothing to add a new expression, meaning, or message. Furthermore, the court reasoned that using the previews increased sales revenue, which meant the use had a commercial purpose. The court also weighed its determination that the works were creative, original works of music in ASCAP’s favor. Additionally, the court held that the previews were verbatim reproductions that copied the works’ expressive and qualitative value, further weighing against AT&T. Finally, since AT&T’s use was not found to be transformative, but to supersede the original work, the court ruled that market harm would likely occur, and that ASCAP and its members already had an established market for licensing previews.",Second Circuit; Internet; Music,Fair use not found
"Peter Letterese & Assocs. v. World Inst. of Scientology Enters.,",533 F.3d 1287 (11th Cir. 2008),2008,United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit,"Plaintiff Peter Letterese & Assocs. (PL&A) acquired the exclusive rights for the book Big League Sales Closing Techniques (BLS). Within a year of acquiring the exclusive rights, PL&A allowed BLS to go out of print and withdrew it from the market. After plaintiff and defendants’ publisher failed to reach agreement on defendants’ use of portions of BLS in training programs, PL&A alleged defendants were infringing its copyright. The two defendants directly responsible for the allegedly infringing acts were the World Institute of Scientology Enterprises, Inc. (WISE) and the Church of Scientology International, Inc. (CSI). WISE assembled packets of course materials that contained portions of BLS material for sale to the general public (“course packets”). CSI created staff training materials that incorporated the sales techniques described in BLS (“staff training material”). Plaintiff appealed the district court’s decision on summary judgment that defendants’ uses of BLS for training purposes were permissible under the fair use doctrine.",Whether the unauthorized reproduction of portions of a book on sales techniques for the purpose of creating training materials and sale to the public constituted fair use.,"The court ruled that defendant CSI’s use of BLS for the staff training material qualified as fair use. But the court found genuine issues of material fact about whether using BLS for the WISE course packets precluded summary judgment in defendant WISE’s favor. The court reached its conclusions primarily based on the fourth factor in the fair use analysis, the effect on the market. CSI’s staff training material was heavily based on church leaders’ writings, was significantly couched in Scientology terms/theories, and was offered internally to church officers who would not typically study BLS, so it did not infringe upon BLS’s primary or potential markets. On the other hand, based on the “unrestricted and widespread dissemination” of the WISE course packets, which were heavily derived from BLS, the court did not have sufficient evidence to determine whether WISE’s copying undermined BLS’s primary or potential markets as a substitute product. The court viewed the first factor as weighing heavily against both WISE and CSI, deeming defendants’ uses non-transformative because the course packs and staff training material did not reshape the instructional purpose nor cast the book in a different light through new meaning or expression. The court found the second factor to be neutral because, while part of BLS was factual in nature, it was couched in uniquely expressive terms. For the third factor, while the defendants’ used a small portion of BLS’s material, what was used contained the “heart” of the book, therefore making this factor weigh slightly in plaintiff’s favor",Eleventh Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Review/Commentary; Textual work,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
"Leadsinger, Inc. v. BMG Music Publ’g,",512 F.3d 522 (9th Cir. 2008),2008,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiff Leadsinger, Inc. manufactured karaoke systems that projected lyrics and still photographs onto a television screen to accompany songs in real time. Defendant BMG Music Publishing issued plaintiff a compulsory mechanical license to cover the musical compositions played on the karaoke machines but also demanded that plaintiff pay a “lyric reprint fee” for copies of lyrics occasionally included with the karaoke machines and a “synchronization fee” for synchronizing the musical compositions in audiovisual works. Plaintiff refused to pay the additional fees and sought a judgment declaring that it did not have to pay them (1) because it was only required to pay for a mechanical license or (2) because displaying and printing the lyrics was fair use. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s order dismissing the case for failure to state a claim.",Whether it was fair use for plaintiff to distribute copies of song lyrics in conjunction with a karaoke system and synchronize the lyrics in an audiovisual work without paying any fees beyond a compulsory license.,"The court held that plaintiff’s publication and display of song lyrics was not fair use. Rejecting the argument that a karaoke machine should be considered a teaching tool, the court held that plaintiff’s use was non- transformative and clearly commercial because the goal was to sell karaoke devices. The court also held that plaintiff’s use of the song lyrics in their entirety weighed against a finding of fair use. Regarding the effect of the use on the potential market for defendant’s works, the court noted that when a use is for commercial gain, the likelihood for market harm may be presumed.",Ninth Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Film/Audiovisual; Music; Photograph; Textual work,Fair use not found
"Lennon v. Premise Media Corp.,",556 F. Supp. 2d 310 (S.D.N.Y. 2008),2008,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiffs Yoko Ono Lennon, Sean Lennon, and Julian Lennon, the widow and children of songwriter and performer John Lennon, brought an action for infringement against the producers of a film that included fifteen seconds of Lennon’s iconic song Imagine without authorization. Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the further distribution of the film and to recall the existing copies.",Whether defendants were likely to prevail in asserting a fair use defense for using fifteen seconds of Imagine in their film.,"The court denied plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that defendants were likely to prevail on a fair use defense. The court held that defendants’ use of Imagine was transformative because their purpose was to criticize the song’s message, seen in how defendants “put the song to a different purpose, selected an excerpt containing the ideas they wished to critique, paired the music and lyrics with images that contrast with the song’s utopian expression, and placed the excerpt in the context of a debate regarding the role of religion in public life.” The court also found that the amount and substantiality of the portion used was reasonable in light of defendants’ purpose and that plaintiffs had not shown that the use would usurp the market for licensing the song for non-transformative purposes.",Second Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Music; Review/Commentary,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
"Warner Bros. Entm’t, Inc. v. RDR Books,",575 F. Supp. 2d 513 (S.D.N.Y. 2008),2008,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff J.K. Rowling authored the Harry Potter books that plaintiff Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. produced as films. Defendant RDR Books published The Lexicon: An Unauthorized Guide to Harry Potter Fiction and Related Materials (the Lexicon), an “A-to-Z guide to the creatures, characters, objects, events, and places that exist in the world of Harry Potter.” To create The Lexicon, defendant relied solely on Rowling’s seven Harry Potter novels and two companion books that expanded on the fictional history and mythical creatures in the novels.",Whether it was fair use for defendant to use aspects of a book series to create and distribute an encyclopedia-like guide for the series.,"The court held that the fair use factors, “weighed together in light of the purposes of copyright law,” did not support a finding of fair use. Regarding the nature and purpose of the use, the court found that the factor weighed against a finding of fair use because “although the Lexicon has a transformative purpose, its actual use of the copyrighted works is not consistently transformative.” Regarding the substance and amount of the work used, the court found that the Lexicon took more of the copyrighted works than was reasonably necessary in relation to its purpose as a reference guide. The court also found that both the creative nature of the copyrighted works and the potential for harm that the Lexicon posed to the market for plaintiff’s works weighed against a finding of fair use. According to the court, “reference guides to works of literature should generally be encouraged by copyright law” but “they should not be permitted to ‘plunder’ the works of original authors . . . ‘without paying the customary price’ . . . lest original authors lose incentive to create new works that will also benefit the public interest.”",Second Circuit; Films/Audiovisual; Textual work,Fair use not found
"Zomba Enters., Inc. v. Panorama Records, Inc.,",491 F.3d 574 (6th Cir. 2007),2007,United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,"Defendant Panorama Records, Inc. manufactured and sold karaoke compact discs. Plaintiff Zomba Enterprises, Inc. alleged that defendant infringed thirty of its musical compositions by including them on karaoke compact discs without prior authorization. Defendant appealed the district court’s ruling in plaintiff’s favor.",Whether defendant’s unauthorized use of plaintiff’s musical compositions on its karaoke discs constituted fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s unauthorized use of plaintiff’s musical compositions to create karaoke discs was not fair. The court found that defendant’s use of the compositions was minimally transformative. The court rejected defendant’s arguments that its use was transformative because the karaoke materials were used for “teaching” and encouraged an “interactive and educational” experience. Instead, the court found that karaoke was a form of entertainment and that defendant had not sought to market its product to schools or advertised it as an educational tool. Further, the court found that the activity at issue was not the karaoke singer’s use of the product, but the copying activity employed by defendant to create the product. The court also found that defendant’s activity was commercial in nature and the musical compositions at issue fell within the core of copyright’s protective purposes. The court noted that defendant acknowledged that it copied entire compositions and hired studio musicians to closely recreate the songs, weighing against a finding of fair use. Finally, the court found that, because plaintiff had previously licensed its musical works for karaoke uses, defendant’s practices had an adverse effect on this existing market.",Sixth Circuit; Music,Fair use not found
"Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.,",508 F.3d 1146 (9th Cir. 2007),2007,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiff Perfect 10, Inc., a subscription website for images of nude models, alleged that defendants Google, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. infringed its copyrights. Plaintiff alleged that Google infringed because its search engine results for image searches included plaintiff’s images. The image search results were shown as reduced-sized, lower resolution “thumbnail” versions of the original images. Another aspect of plaintiff’s claim related to a business agreement Google had with Amazon.com that permitted Google’s search engine to send search results, including plaintiff’s images, to Amazon.com customers. Defendants appealed the district court’s grant of a preliminary injunction enjoining Google from creating and publicly displaying thumbnail versions of plaintiff’s images.",Whether defendants were likely to prevail on the argument that their use of thumbnail images was a fair use of plaintiff’s images.,"The court concluded that the use of thumbnail versions of plaintiff’s images was a fair use and held that Google was likely to succeed in proving its fair use defense, thus vacating the preliminary injunction regarding Google’s use of the thumbnail images. It deemed the use “highly transformative” because a search engine transformed an image into a pointer directing a user to a source of information and provided a social benefit by incorporating an original work into an electronic reference tool. The court held that market harm could not be presumed, given the highly transformative nature of the use, and that the potential harm to plaintiff’s market was hypothetical.",Ninth Circuit; Internet/Digitization; Photograph,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
"Fitzgerald v. CBS Broad., Inc.,",491 F. Supp. 2d 177 (D. Mass. 2007),2007,United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts,"Plaintiff, a freelance photojournalist, sued defendant CBS after its unauthorized broadcast of his copyrighted photographs of a high-profile criminal defendant moments after his arrest. The photographs were broadcast several times on CBS-affiliated news programming.",Whether defendant’s unauthorized use of plaintiff’s photographs of a high- profile criminal defendant in news programming concerning events related to that criminal defendant constituted fair use.,"The court found that the defendant’s television broadcast of the photographs was not fair use. Although the defendant’s use of the photographs was newsworthy, it was for commercial gain, weighing against fair use. The court found that the defendant’s slight cropping and placement of the photograph did not make the use transformative, as plaintiff and defendant shared the same intended meaning and use of the works—namely, news reporting. Finally, the court determined that CBS’ repeated, widespread use would adversely impact the potential media licensing market for plaintiff’s photographs.",First Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; News Reporting; Photograph,Fair use not found
"Tavory v. NTP, Inc.,",495 F. Supp. 2d 531 (E.D. Va. 2007),2007,United States Court of Appeals for the Eastern District of Virginia,"Plaintiff Oren Tavory filed an action to be joined as an inventor with respect to six telecommunications patents held by defendant NTP, Inc. As part of the action, plaintiff claimed that he owned the copyright to certain source code contained in the software at issue. Plaintiff further claimed that defendant violated his copyright in the source code by making copies of the six related patent applications (which were alleged to have contained the source code) and distributing the copies to parties, experts, and the court in a previously concluded litigation that did not involve plaintiff. Defendant brought a motion for summary judgment directed, in part, to plaintiff’s infringement claim.",Whether defendant’s unauthorized reproduction of allegedly protected source code for use during litigation was fair use.,"The court held that the litigation-related conduct giving rise to the opportunities for which the source code was copied was a fair use. The court based its determination on its conclusion that the adjudication of the previously concluded litigation “required the reproduction and dissemination of the patent applications, which necessarily set forth the code that [plaintiff] claims to have authored.” Additionally, the court relied on its determination that “the character of the [defendant’s] use was not commercial, nor was the potential market for or value of the software source code impaired.”",Fourth Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual work; Used in government proceeding,Fair use found
"Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd.,",448 F.3d 605 (2d Cir. 2006),2006,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff Bill Graham Archives owned copyrights in artistic images originally used on concert posters and tickets to promote events for the rock band the Grateful Dead. Defendant Dorling Kindersley Publishing (DK) sought permission from plaintiff to reproduce images of seven such posters and tickets in a 480-page cultural history of the group titled Grateful Dead: The Illustrated Trip. After the parties failed to reach an agreement, DK nevertheless reproduced and displayed the posters and tickets. When DK refused to pay license fees for use of the posters and tickets after publishing the book, plaintiff sued for infringement. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling that DK’s reproduction of the images in the book was fair use.",Whether it was fair use for defendants to reproduce Grateful Dead concert posters and tickets for publication in a book on the band’s history without permission from the copyright owner of the artwork that appears on the posters and tickets.,"The court upheld the district court’s ruling that defendants’ copying of the images was fair use. It reasoned that defendant’s use of the concert posters and tickets “as historical artifacts of Grateful Dead performances is transformatively different from the original expressive purpose of [the] copyrighted images.” The court also reasoned that the fact that the images were copied in their entirety did not weigh against fair use because “the reduced size of the images” was consistent with plaintiff’s transformative purpose. Additionally, the court found that the plaintiff’s use did not harm the market for defendant’s sale of the copyrighted artwork.",Second Circuit; Painting/Drawing/Graphic,Fair use found
"Blanch v. Koons,",467 F.3d 244 (2d Cir. 2006),2006,United States Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff, photographer Andrea Blanch, owned the copyright in Silk Sandals by Gucci (Silk Sandals) a photograph taken for the August 2000 issue of Allure magazine. Silk Sandals is a close-up of a woman’s lower legs and feet resting on a man’s lap. Defendants Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and Deutsche Bank commissioned a series of works from defendant Jeff Koons. One of the works, Niagara, included a rotated image of the legs and feet from Silk Sandals, omitting the background of the original photo. Blanch filed an infringement action. The district court granted defendants summary judgment, in part based on its finding that Koons’ use of Silk Sandals was fair use.",Whether an artist’s appropriation of a copyrighted photograph for use in a collage painting was protected fair use.,"The Second Circuit held that defendant’s appropriation of plaintiff’s photograph constituted fair use and affirmed the district court’s grant of summary judgment. The court deemed the collage transformative because defendant used the photograph as “raw material” in the furtherance of distinct creative or communicative objectives. The court ruled that the creation and exhibition of the painting could not fairly be described as commercial exploitation, that “commerciality” of the use is not dispositive in any event, and that there was insufficient evidence of bad faith on defendant’s part. Additionally, the court found that the amount and substantiality of the copying was reasonable in relation to its purpose and that the painting had no deleterious effect on the potential market for or value of the photograph.",Second Circuit; Painting/Drawing/Graphic; Photograph,Fair use found
"Wall Data, Inc. v. L.A. Cnty. Sheriff’s Dep’t,",447 F.3d 769 (9th Cir. 2006),2006,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Defendant Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department purchased 3,663 licenses for plaintiff Wall Data, Inc.’s computer software. Defendant installed the software in 6,007 computers, but configured it so that only 3,663 computers could use it at the same time. Plaintiff alleged that its software was “over-installed” in violation of the licensing agreement that restricted use of each license to a “single designated computer” and prohibited use “in any other multiple computer or multiple user arrangement.” Defendant appealed the district court’s ruling that limiting the number of “useable” copies to the number of licenses was not fair use.",Whether it was fair use to install software on more computers than permitted under a license where the total number of computers that may access the software at the same time never exceeds the total number of licenses purchased.,"The court held that defendant’s over-installation of software was not fair use, finding all four fair use factors supported that conclusion. In determining that the use was not transformative, the court noted that defendant’s argument was weakened by the fact that it made exact copies of the software and used it for the same purpose as the original. Moreover, although defendant did not commercially compete with plaintiff, the use was still commercial because the repeated and exploitative use saved defendant the expense of purchasing more authorized copies or more flexible licenses. The court also determined that the copying affected plaintiff’s potential market because defendant only purchased a few licenses and found a way to install the program on all its computers without paying the fee required for each installation. Defendant could have bargained for such flexibility in its license agreements, but it did not, leading to a negative effect on the potential market. The nature of the work and amount and substantiality factors went against fair use because computer programs are protected works, and the entire program was copied verbatim.",Ninth Circuit; Computer program,Fair use not found
"Clean Flicks of Colo., LLC v. Soderbergh,",433 F. Supp. 2d 1236 (D. Colo. 2006),2006,United States District Court for the District of Colorado,"Plaintiffs used film editing techniques to mechanically redact what they considered inappropriate audio and visual elements from copyrighted films. They legally acquired defendants’ films, primarily as DVDs, and then sold or rented their edited versions, generally accompanied with the deactivated original copies, through established retail outlets. Plaintiffs asked the court for a declaratory judgment that they were not infringing defendants’ works. Defendants, motion picture studios, counterclaimed that plaintiffs infringed their copyrights by editing their films to create and sell derivative works.",Whether the unauthorized editing of studios’ films to eliminate allegedly harmful or objectionable subject matter for public distribution constituted fair use.,"The court held that public distribution of edited versions of plaintiffs’ films for the purpose of eliminating objectionable content did not constitute fair use. It ruled that the edited film versions were not transformative because they added nothing new to the originals. It further held that the “amount and substantiality” factor weighed against a finding of fair use because the movies were copied in their entirety for non-transformative use. Regarding the fourth factor, plaintiffs claimed that there was no adverse effect on the market for the films because they maintained a one-to-one ratio between original and edited films, and that but for their editing, the defendants would not have sold those particular original copies. The court, however, stated that this argument ignored the defendants’ “right to control the content of the copyrighted work,” and further remarked that “[w]hether these films should be edited in a manner that would make them acceptable to more of the public … is a question of what audience the copyright owner wants to reach.” The court also found that editing the versions as a form of comment or criticism was a public policy argument that was not appropriately raised in the copyright context.",Tenth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual,Fair use not found
"BMG Music v. Gonzalez,",430 F.3d 888 (7th Cir. 2005),2005,United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,"Plaintiffs, recording companies including BMG Music, alleged that defendant Gonzalez infringed their copyrights in several audio recordings when she used a “file-sharing network” to download and retain unauthorized copies on her home computer. Defendant asserted a fair use defense, claiming she intended to sample the works on a “try-before-you-buy basis.” Defendant appealed the district court’s ruling in plaintiffs’ favor.",Whether defendant’s unauthorized downloading and retention of plaintiffs’ copyright-protected works to purportedly sample the works before buying was fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s unauthorized downloading and retention of copyright protected works was not fair use. In reaching its conclusion, the court first determined that defendant was not engaged in a nonprofit use due to her downloading and retention of whole copyrighted songs that “often are sold per song as well as per album.” The court then focused on the negative effect of the use on the potential market, finding that “[m]usic downloaded for free from the Internet is a close substitute for purchased music.” The court discounted defendant’s assertion that she was trying music before buying by pointing out that the market for methods of introducing potential consumers to music, for example radio, was negatively impacted by competition from peer-to-peer networks. Finally, the court noted that there existed myriad authorized means for customers to listen to music before purchasing, and concluded that defendant’s downloading was not a fair use.",Seventh Circuit; Internet/Digitization; Music,Fair use not found

Due to defendant’s mismanagement of judicial procedure, plaintiff sought default judgment with respect to the copyright infringement claim.",Whether defendant’s unauthorized use of seven images on its website constituted fair use.,The court found that defendant’s use of the images did not constitute fair use.

"Compaq Computer Corp. v.

Defendant Compaq Computer Corp. created a guidebook, Safety and Comfort Guide, that was packaged with each Compaq computer and distributed to millions of customers. Defendant’s guide contained four illustrations and seven phrases that were similar to photographs and phrases in plaintiff’s book. The district court ruled that defendant’s use of THB was fair use. Plaintiff appealed.",Whether the district court erred in finding fair use where defendant’s guidebook included illustrations and phrases similar to the photographs and phrases found in plaintiff’s guidebook.,"The court affirmed the district court’s determination that defendant’s use was fair. In reaching its conclusion, the court weighed the fact that plaintiff had classified THB as a “factual teaching text” in favor of fair use. Also in favor of fair use, the court considered the fact that defendant had used “minimal portions,” four illustrations and seven phrases out of THB’s approximately 100 pages and eighty-eight photographs. Finally, the court found that the impact defendant’s distribution of the guidebook had on the potential market for THB did not weigh against a finding of fair use because plaintiffs had ceased actively marketing THB, and the potential market had already been thwarted by company managers reading the book and instructing employees on the techniques rather than instructing employees to purchase the work.",Fifth Circuit; Painting/Drawing/Graphic; Textual work,Fair use found
"Ty, Inc. v. Publ'ns Int'l, Ltd.,",333 F. Supp. 2d 705 (N.D. Ill. 2004),2004,United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois,"Plaintiff Ty, Inc. created the popular Beanie Babies series of beanbag toy animals and registered them as sculptural works. Plaintiff alleged that defendant Publications International, Ltd. infringed its copyrights by publishing several collector’s guides that included photographs of Beanie Babies. The guides also contained descriptive text that was sometimes critical of plaintiff. Defendant appealed the district court’s first ruling, which was in plaintiff’s favor. On appeal, the circuit court remanded the case back to the district court for further consideration.",Whether defendant’s unauthorized use of photographs of Beanie Babies in collector’s guides was fair use.,"On remand, the district court found defendant liable for infringement. The court found that the defendant’s photographs of plaintiff’s copyrighted works were non-transformative because both the toys and the photographs served the same decorative, aesthetic purposes. The court also found that defendant’s works were primarily commercial and the unauthorized use of the photographs served no broader public purpose than to avoid paying the customary price plaintiff charged for licensing images of its works. Additionally, the court found that defendant copied more of the work than was necessary to achieve the goal of comment or criticism of the works. The court then determined that defendant’s books harmed the market for plaintiff’s products or licensed derivatives by functioning as market substitutes for these licensed works. The court then rejected defendant’s argument that the photographs were necessary to create a competitive collector’s guide because, even if defendant had a right to produce such a guide, it still copied more of plaintiff’s work than was necessary. Note: This case was before the court on remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. See: Ty, Inc. v.

Mar. 8, 2004)",2004,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff MasterCard International, Inc., a financial services company, alleged that defendants, 2000 presidential candidate Ralph Nader and his political committee, created a campaign advertisement that infringed plaintiff’s “Priceless” advertisements. The “Priceless” advertisements included the identification of a series of priceless intangibles, followed by the word “Priceless.” The advertisements ended with the phrase “there are some things money can't buy, for everything else there’s MasterCard.” Defendants’ campaign advertisement identified a series of corrupt campaign practices, followed by the phrase “finding out the truth: priceless.” The campaign advertisement ended with the phrase “there are some things that money can't buy.” Defendants claimed their campaign advertisement was a non-infringing parody of plaintiff’s advertisements and filed a motion for summary judgment.",Whether defendants’ copying of features of plaintiff’s advertisement for use in their own political campaign advertisement constituted fair use.,"The court granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment, finding that the copying constituted fair use because the campaign advertisement parodied MasterCard’s commercial advertisements. The court also determined that defendants’ transformative use served a political, non-commercial purpose, entirely different from the commercial purpose of plaintiff’s original work. While the court found that MasterCard’s creative advertisements were in the “core of intended copyright protection,” it determined that the relevance of the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, was slight when dealing with parodies. Finally, the court found that the third factor, the amount taken, was irrelevant when the first and fourth factor weigh in favor of fair use in the case of parody, and that the entirely different purpose of defendants’ advertisement made the fourth factor also weigh in favor of fair use.",Second Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Parody/Satire,Fair use found
"Video Pipeline, Inc. v. Buena Vista Home Entm’t, Inc.,",342 F.3d 191 (3d Cir. 2003),2003,United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit,"Defendant Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of The Walt Disney Pictures and Television Co., held an exclusive license to distribute Disney products in the home video market. In 1988, defendant authorized plaintiff Video Pipeline to create compilations of its video trailers and distribute the trailers to traditional home video retail outlets. In 1997, when the video retail market shifted to an internet distribution model, plaintiff began distributing the trailers over the internet, via digital streams, and charging internet video retailers for the right to access the trailers. In 2000, defendant advised plaintiff that it did not have permission to distribute its trailers on the internet. In response, plaintiff filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that its online use of the trailers was legal pursuant to a previous licensing agreement. Defendant subsequently terminated the licensing agreement. After the licensing agreement was cancelled, plaintiff began using short segments from defendant’s films to create its own movie trailers and stream them over the internet. Plaintiff then sought a declaratory judgment that its use of the segments was permissible. Defendant claimed plaintiff’s use of the segments or “clip previews” infringed its copyrights in the films. Plaintiff argued that its use was protected by the first sale and fair use doctrines. The district court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of defendant.","Whether plaintiff’s creation, distribution and online display of clip previews constituted fair use.","The court found that the district court correctly held that plaintiff failed to show that it was likely to prevail on its defense that its online display of the clip previews constituted fair use. Regarding the purpose and character of the use, the court found that plaintiff’s use did not add new expression, meaning, or message to the original works and thus lacked transformative quality. Regarding the nature of the works, the court characterized defendant’s works as “creative, non-factual expression” and weighed the factor against a finding of fair use. Regarding the amount and substantiality of the work copied, the court found that plaintiff only copied a small amount of defendant’s works (full-length films) and that the copied segments did not go to the “heart” of the films, which weighed in favor of fair use. Finally, regarding the potential market effect, the court held that plaintiff’s streaming of segments of defendant’s works over the internet could cause cognizable harm to the market for defendant to license authorized trailers for its works.",Third Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Internet/Digitization,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"

The autobiography was titled: Self- Portrait of a Patricide: How I got Away with Murder. Years later, when plaintiff’s wife was in a child-custody battle with her former husband, the former husband introduced plaintiff’s manuscript as evidence that her current home with plaintiff was not suitable for children. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling that the former husband’s use of the manuscript as evidence in court was protected by fair use.",Whether reproducing a copyrighted manuscript to introduce as evidence in a child-custody proceeding constituted a “fair use” of the manuscript.,"The court held that the former husband’s use of the work was a permissible fair use. The court based its decision on its finding that the former husband’s purpose for using the work was narrowly related to the manuscript’s evidentiary value. The court also ruled that, by introducing the work as evidence, the former husband was relying on the “historical facts” therein, not the “mode of expression” or any other creative element. Finally, the court held that there was no evidence that admitting the manuscript into evidence would adversely affect the work’s marketability.",Fourth Circuit; Textual work; Unpublished; Used in government proceeding,Fair use found
"United States v.

In return for downloading pirated software, PWA required members to participate in some aspect of its operations, such as procuring the software, eliminating internal copyright protections, or testing software before it could be uploaded to the group’s servers. Ultimately, the FBI seized the group’s server, and several members were indicted for criminal copyright infringement. At trial, the district court denied defendants’ request to instruct the jury on the fair use defense.",Whether it was proper for the district court to refuse to instruct the jury on fair use in a criminal case involving software piracy over the Internet.,"The circuit court affirmed the lower court’s refusal to instruct the jury on fair use, finding defendants’ arguments—that their site was for noncommercial, educational, and entertainment purposes only—“barely pass the straight-face test.” While the court acknowledged that “[l]imited copying may be permissible for certain noncommercial, educational purposes, taking into account the nature of the copyrighted work and market considerations,” it found that such factors “weigh against application of the fair use doctrine to cases involving internet piracy.” The court concluded that it “is preposterous to think that internet piracy is authorized by virtue of the fair use doctrine.”",Seventh Circuit; Computer program; Internet/digitization,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
"Elvis Presley Enters., Inc. v. Passport Video,","349 F.3d 622 (9th Cir. 2003), overruled on other grounds by eBay, Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388 (2006)",2003,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiffs were companies and individuals holding copyrights in various materials related to Elvis Presley. Defendants, Passport Entertainment and its related entities, produced and sold The Definitive Elvis, a 16-hour video documentary on Elvis Presley’s life. Plaintiffs’ video clips made up at least 5% to 10% of The Definitive Elvis, often overlaid with narration or commentary. The commentary was not always directly related to the video clips. The documentary also featured significant portions of Presley’s appearances on various 1950s and 1960s television shows, shown without voiceover. Defendants did not obtain licenses to use the copyrighted material. Plaintiffs sued for copyright infringement. The district court found that the use of plaintiffs’ copyrighted materials was likely not fair use and granted a preliminary injunction. Defendants appealed.","Whether the unauthorized incorporation of Elvis Presley video clips, photographs, and music into a documentary about his life constituted fair use.","The court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that defendants’ use of plaintiffs’ materials did not qualify as fair use. Concerning the purpose of the use, the court noted that The Definitive Elvis was clearly commercial in nature, and was not a scholarly critique or historical analysis. Nor was the use consistently transformative, as the film clips were used in excess of the purpose of citing them as historical reference points in Elvis’ life. The court also found that, though the nature of the works used did not cut clearly in either party’s favor, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the second factor weighed in plaintiffs’ favor. Regarding the amount and substantiality of the works used, the court noted that many clips were repeated multiple times, some long, and some were the heart of the work. Here again the court concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion. Finally, the court noted that because the use was commercial in nature, market harm could be presumed. The market for licensing television clips would be undermined with widespread use of this type. The market for still photos and music, however, would probably not be undermined, as The Definitive Elvis was not a substitute. The court concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding adverse market effect.",Ninth Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Film/Audiovisual; Music; Photograph; Review/Commentary,Fair use not found
"Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp.,",336 F.3d 811 (9th Cir. 2003),2003,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiff Leslie Kelly, a professional photographer, alleged that defendant Arriba Soft Corp.’s search engine infringed Kelly’s photographs. Defendant operated a visual search engine that “crawled” the internet searching for images that it copied and then generated as smaller, lower-resolution “thumbnail” copies for display on a search results page. Defendant reproduced thirty-five of plaintiff’s photographs and displayed them as thumbnails in response to search requests. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling that defendant’s use of plaintiff’s photographs in its search engine was fair use.",Whether defendant’s display of thumbnail versions of copyright protected images on an internet visual search engine constituted fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s reproduction of plaintiff’s photos as thumbnail images was fair use. The court deemed the use transformative because the thumbnails served an entirely different function than the original images. While plaintiff’s images were artistic works, the court found that defendant’s use of them was “unrelated to any aesthetic purpose” and that the search engine instead “functions as a tool to help index and improve access to images on the internet and their related web sites.” The court also found that the lower-resolution thumbnail images did not harm the market for or value of plaintiff’s images.",Ninth Circuit; Internet/Digitization; Photograph,Fair use found
"Mattel Inc. v. Walking Mountain Prods.,",353 F.3d 792 (9th Cir. 2003),2003,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiff Mattel, Inc., a toy manufacturer, alleged that defendant Tom Forsythe, a photographer and owner of Walking Mountain Productions, infringed its famous Barbie doll by creating a series of photographs depicting a Barbie doll in absurd and sometimes sexualized positions, usually posed with various kitchen appliances. Defendant asserted that his work was an attempt to critique the objectification of women. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling that defendant’s Barbie doll photographs were parodies protected by fair use.",Whether defendant’s photographs of Barbie dolls as part of a social critique constituted fair use.,"On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court’s finding that defendant’s Barbie doll photographs were fair use. The court based its holding on finding that defendant’s use of the dolls for the purpose of parody was transformative and that “the extremely transformative nature and parodic quality” of the defendant’s work made its commercial qualities “become less important.” The court also found that the extent of defendant’s copying of the dolls was justified in light of the parodic purpose and the photographic medium used. The court also found that defendant’s parodic use was highly unlikely to “substitute for products in Mattel’s markets or the markets of Mattel’s licensees.”",Ninth Circuit; Parody/Satire; Photograph; Review/Commentary,Fair use found

Substance, Inc.,","354 F.3d 624 (7th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 816 (2004)",2003,United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,"Plaintiff Chicago Board of Education owned the copyright to several secure tests. Defendant, a Chicago public school teacher, published six of the secure tests in a local newspaper, Substance, to demonstrate the tests’ inadequacy. Substance was also named a defendant. The district court ruled against fair use, and defendants appealed.",Whether defendant’s reproduction of plaintiff’s secure exams in a local newspaper to demonstrate the exams’ inadequacy was fair use.,"The Seventh Circuit rejected defendants’ fair use argument, finding that they published more of the exams than was necessary to make the point that some of the questions were flawed. The court also found that the defendants’ actions destroyed the value of the exams: although there was no market for the exams, the plaintiff could not reuse the exam questions after they had been published.",Seventh Circuit; Review/Commentary; Textual work,Fair use not found

Otsar Sifrei Lubavitch, Inc.,",312 F.3d 94 (2d Cir. 2002),2002,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff Merkos L’Inyonei Chinuch, Inc. published an English translation of the Hebrew prayerbook Siddur Tehillat Hashem. Defendant Otsar Sifrei Lubavitch, Inc. published a new version of the prayerbook that copied verbatim from plaintiff’s translation. Defendant appealed the district court’s ruling in plaintiff’s favor, enjoining defendant from disseminating its version of the book.",Whether defendant’s verbatim copying of plaintiff’s English translation of a Hebrew prayerbook constituted fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s use was not a fair use. Though defendant’s version of the prayerbook added user-friendly instructions to the translation and used a different layout, the court found that the factors did not favor a finding of fair use. Focusing in particular on the third and fourth fair use factors, the amount and substantiality of the portion used and the effect on the potential market, the court determined that defendant had copied the entire translation and had used it for a purpose identical to plaintiff’s, all of which weighed against a finding of fair use.",Second Circuit; Textual Work,Fair use not found
"L.A. News Serv. v. CBS Broad., Inc.,",305 F.3d 924 (9th Cir. 2002),2002,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiff Los Angeles News Service (LANS) licensed its news stories, photographs, audiovisual works, and other services to other news media outlets. While covering the 1992 Los Angeles riots, LANS filmed several segments of nighttime rioting, including the iconic segment titled Beating of Reginald Denny. Defendant CBS was then part of Viacom Inc., which operated Group W, a video news service that had on several occasions licensed LANS footage. LANS offered Group W a license to distribute the riot footage, but Group W declined the offer. LANS alleged that, without a license, Group W distributed the footage to subscriber Court TV, which used a few seconds of the footage as part of a video montage to promote its coverage of a trial relating to persons depicted in the footage (the promo montage) and as part of an introductory montage for one of its television shows (the title sequence). Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling that Court TV was entitled to a fair use defense.",Whether it was fair use for defendant to incorporate a portion of plaintiff’s copyrighted recording into promotional video spots and a program introductory sequence.,"The court held that defendant’s use of the plaintiff’s video footage both in the promo montage and the title sequence was fair. In reaching its conclusion, the court relied on its determination that defendant used plaintiff’s footage for the purposes of news reporting and the promotion of news reporting. The court also found that the informational and factual nature of the footage favored a finding of fair use. Regarding the amount and substantiality of the footage used, the court weighed the length of the portion used (only a few seconds) against the significance of the portion used (the most recognizable frames) and found that this aspect of the fair use analysis was neutral. Finally, the court held that the defendant’s use of the footage in both the promo montage and the title sequence would likely not affect the relevant market for licensing plaintiff’s work.",Ninth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; News reporting,Fair use found
"Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin Co.,",268 F.3d 1257 (11th Cir. 2001),2001,United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit,"Defendant publisher Houghton Mifflin owned the rights to the 2001 novel The Wind Done Gone (TWDG), which was based on and critiqued Margaret Mitchell’s well-known 1936 novel Gone With The Wind (GWTW). Plaintiff Suntrust Bank, trustee for the Mitchell heirs, owned and managed GWTW’s copyrights, including derivative works. Plaintiff alleged that TWDG violated the trust’s copyright interests by explicitly referring to GWTW in the foreword; copying core characters, traits, and relationships; copying and summarizing famous scenes; and copying verbatim certain dialogues and descriptions. Defendant appealed the district court’s ruling in plaintiff’s favor.",Whether a novel critiquing/parodying another novel through verbatim and nonliteral copying of characters/plot was fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s borrowing from GWTW was fair use. The court first found that the defendant’s novel was in fact a parody because it commented on or criticized an original work by appropriating its elements to create a new artistic work. Specifically, TWDG criticizes GWTW’s depiction of slavery and race relations in the antebellum South. The court found that although TWDG clearly had a commercial purpose, its significantly transformative nature outweighed that fact. According to the court, TWDG added significant new expression and meaning by transforming GWTW from a third-person epic to a first-person diary or memoir. Additionally, the last half of TWDG told a completely new story that, while incorporating GWTW characters and settings, featured plot elements found nowhere in the original work. The court gave little weight to the “nature of the work” factor, finding that while GWTW was an original work of fiction entitled to the greatest degree of protection, parodies almost invariably copy publicly known expressive works. Regarding the amount of GWTW used, the court found that, based upon the record before it, it could not determine “in any conclusive way” whether the quantity and value of the materials used was reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying. Finally, the court found that plaintiff’s evidence failed to demonstrate that TWDG would have a deleterious effect on the market for GWTW by displacing sales.",Eleventh Circuit; Parody/Satire; Textual work,Fair use found
"Davis v. Gap, Inc.,",246 F.3d 152 (2d Cir. 2001),2001,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff On Davis created and designed nonfunctional decorative eyewear, “Onoculii Designs,” that he described as “sculptured metallic ornamental wearable art.” Defendant Gap, an international retailer of clothing and accessories, created an advertisement that prominently featured a model wearing plaintiff’s copyrighted eyewear. On Davis filed an infringement action against defendant Gap, and the district court granted summary judgment in the Gap’s favor. On Davis appealed.",Whether defendant’s use of plaintiff’s copyright-protected decorative eyewear in an advertisement constituted fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s use of the copyrighted work in its advertisement was not protected as a fair use. The court found that the purpose of the use was not transformative in any way and that the ad displayed the eyewear in the manner it was designed to be worn. The court also found that defendant’s use was paradigmatically commercial in nature. Regarding the nature of the work, the court determined that plaintiff’s decorative eyeglasses were an artistic creation that fell close to the core of copyright’s protective purposes. The use was also substantial, as the ad prominently featured the glasses. Finally, concerning the market effects of the use, the court held that defendant merely adopted plaintiff’s design for its ad without authorization. Plaintiff suffered market harm through the loss of royalty revenue for such use and diminution of the opportunity to license to others who may regard the plaintiff’s design as preempted by the defendant’s ad.",Second Circuit; Other,Fair use not found
"Veeck v. S. Bldg. Code Congress Int’l,",241 F.3d 398 (5th Cir. 2001),2001,United States Court of Appeal for the Fifth Circuit,"Defendant-appellee Southern Building Code Congress International (SBCCI) was a nonprofit organization that developed, promoted, and promulgated model building codes for construction, plumbing, gas, fire and mechanical building projects. SBCCI encouraged local governments, free of charge, to enact its copyright protected codes into law by reference in statutes and ordinances. Generally, the public was advised they could obtain access and make copies of portions of the codes in city offices or local libraries. Plaintiff Peter Veeck operated a website providing information about North Texas, including full texts of local building codes. When Veeck failed to obtain copies of the building codes in his hometown, he purchased a copy of the codes in electronic format from SBCCI and posted it on his website. After SBCCI sent him a cease and desist order accusing him of copyright infringement, Veeck filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment that he did not infringe SBCCI’s copyright. Veeck appealed the district court’s ruling finding that publication of the codes was not a fair use.",Whether Veeck’s posting of SBCCI’s model building codes constituted fair use.,"The appeals court rejected Veeck’s fair use defense. The court first determined that model codes, while similar to uncopyrightable statutes and judicial opinions, do not lose their copyright when used or adopted by a state or local government. The court then found that Veeck’s use, while noncommercial per se, could severely undermine the market for SBCCI’s works if such use became widespread. The court found that Veeck’s copying and posting of SBCCI’s codes would reduce SBCCI’s market and deprive it of income used in its socially valuable effort of creating and promulgating these codes. Note: upon rehearing, the appeals court reversed and remanded with instructions to dismiss SBCCI’s claims based on the reasoning that Veeck copied only the law and did not infringe SBCCI’s copyrights in building codes. A dissent by four judges including the chief judge found that SBCCI’s posting of the entire building code on the website was not fair use. Veeck v. S. Bldg. Code Cong.

"A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.,",239 F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 2001),2001,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Defendant Napster, Inc. designed and operated a peer-to-peer (P2P) file- sharing network allowing users to search, access, and download audio recordings stored in MP3 digital file format on their own or others’ computers. Plaintiffs, corporate music producers, complained that Napster users obtained copyrighted works from each other’s networked computers without copyright holders’ authorization. Napster asserted that the service had legitimate purposes: sampling works in deciding whether to make a purchase; accessing works the users already owned (space-shifting); and receiving authorized distributions of copyrighted works. Plaintiffs alleged Napster was liable for contributory and vicarious copyright infringement as a result of its operation of the P2P network. The district court granted plaintiffs a preliminary injunction, finding in part that Napster’s P2P file-sharing service was not a fair use of copyrighted works. Napster appealed.","Whether transferring copyrighted works in digital audio files from someone else’s computer through a P2P file-sharing network to download a copy, without authorization or payment, constituted fair use.","The Ninth Circuit held that the district court did not err in ruling that transfer of digital files through Napster’s service was not fair use. The court deemed the purpose of the use non-transformative, noting that courts are reluctant to find fair use where the original work is merely retransmitted in a new medium. The court also found the purpose to be commercial, concluding that recurring exploitative copying constitutes commercial use when made to avoid the expense of buying an authorized copy and that users also received other copyrighted works in exchange for making their own files available for download. Additionally, the court found that the nature of the works was creative (as opposed to fact-based) and that the file-sharing process generally involved copying works in their entirety, both weighing against a finding of fair use. Regarding the market effect, plaintiffs introduced sufficient evidence to show that Napster caused a reduction in audio CD sales and hindered plaintiffs’ ability to enter the digital sales market. The court also found that the lower court did not err in determining that downloading for sampling purposes is a commercial use. It determined that, even if users ultimately buy the recording, free promotional downloads are highly regulated by the recording industry. Furthermore, the court found that the users who downloaded for sampling purposes were actually less likely to purchase an authorized copy. Regarding space-shifting, the court remarked that courts have only permitted space shifting by the original user. Napster impermissibly allowed space shifting between different, subsequent users.",Ninth Circuit; Internet/Digitization; Format shifting/Space shifting; Music,Fair use not found
"Byrne v. BBC,",132 F. Supp. 2d 229 (S.D.N.Y. 2001),2001,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Defendant BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) filmed and recorded a live broadcast of a U.S. radio program, including theme music written by plaintiff Christopher Byrne. Byrne had authorized the radio program to use the song, but had not extended permission to the BBC to record the theme song as part of filming the radio show broadcast, or to rebroadcast the song when the BBC used the recorded footage in the United Kingdom as part of a news report. Byrne filed an infringement claim against the BBC. The BBC moved for partial summary judgment of non-infringement.",Whether it was fair use for the BBC to record plaintiff’s song as part of a radio program it filmed for a news broadcast.,"The court denied plaintiff BBC’s motion for summary judgment because it found that disputed issues of material facts regarding fair use still existed. Specifically, the court found that the analysis would be influenced by whether a jury determined that the purpose of the use was to entertain rather than inform, and could also turn on the availability of equally informative non-infringing alternatives. Furthermore, the court found that the BBC’s status as a non-profit organization did not confer “special immunity from determinations of copyright violation.” Rather, “[t]he question . . . is the purpose and character of the use, not of the alleged infringer.”",Second Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Music; News reporting,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"

Defendant Discovery Communications, Inc. used clips from Werewolf and Frankenstein in a documentary titled 100 Years of Horror. Defendant also used clips from the Saucerman trailer in a documentary about the history of aliens in films titled Aliens Invade Hollywood (Aliens).",Whether the unauthorized use of clips from movies involving aliens for a documentary about the history of aliens in film constituted fair use.,"The court dismissed the claims relating to Frankenstein and Werewolf and focused only on Saucerman for its fair use analysis. The court held that defendant’s use of the Saucerman clips in Aliens was fair. It determined that defendant made transformative use of the clips in a “documentary-style program” and that documentaries are generally entitled to the presumption that their use of copyrighted material is fair. The court also found that the second factor weighed slightly in plaintiff’s favor because Saucerman was no longer shown in theaters and was not available for rent in stores. Finally, the court determined that defendant’s use of Saucerman clips in Aliens consisted of less than 1% of Saucerman, which did not constitute the heart of the original work, and did not produce any demonstrable impact on the “diminutive” market for the original work or for clips from the original work.",Second Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Film/Audiovisual; Review/Commentary,Fair use found

Defendants Brent Bozell and others, who were affiliated with defendant Media Research Center’s Parents Television Council (PTC), initiated a campaign against WWE. PTC used WWE’s copyright-protected content to criticize its programming and to call attention to allegations that children died from imitating what they saw in WWE programming. PTC also released a fundraising video that included defendant’s copyrighted content.",Whether the unauthorized use of copyrighted content in an awareness campaign to show alleged excessive violence and inappropriateness of an entertainment program was fair use.,"The court rejected defendants’ claim that they only used the content for criticism and were therefore within the bounds of fair use. The court held that the use of the copyrighted content in the fundraising video was obviously not only used for criticism, but also for financial gain and to increase notoriety.",Second Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Review/Commentary,Fair use not found
"Nunez v. Caribbean Int’l News Corp.,",235 F.3d 18 (1st Cir. 2000),2000,United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit,"Plaintiff Sixto Nunez, a professional photographer, took several nude and nearly nude photographs of Joyce Giraud, who was Miss Puerto Rico Universe 1997, for her modeling portfolio. Following standard practice, he distributed them to members of the modeling community. Controversy ensued over whether nude and semi-nude photographs were appropriate for a pageant winner. After the photos were displayed on television, defendant’s newspaper, El Vocero, published three of plaintiff’s photos without permission, alongside several articles about the controversy. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling that defendant’s publication of the photographs was a fair use.",Whether the unauthorized reproduction and publication of photographs that are themselves newsworthy constituted fair use.,"The court determined that defendant’s publication of plaintiff’s photographs was fair use. Although the photos were placed on the newspaper’s cover in an attempt to increase sales, the court found that the purpose and character of use still favored fair use: the photos were informative and illustrative of the story; the purpose of the use was transformative from the original intended use as a modeling portfolio; and defendant used the photos in good faith. The court decided the nature of the work was a neutral factor since it was difficult to categorize the photos as either creative or factual. The court further stated that the newspaper did not threaten plaintiff’s right of first publication because he had previously distributed them, they were shown on the television before the newspaper printed them, and they were intended for public dissemination. The court also found that the market was not negatively affected because plaintiff used the photos for publicity purposes, not to make money, by distributing them to the modeling community for free. Additionally, the court determined that the relatively poor reproduction by the newspaper cover should not affect demand for the portfolio, but instead could increase it.",First Circuit; News reporting; Photograph,Fair use found
"Sony Computer Entm’t, Inc. v. Connectix Corp.,",203 F.3d 596 (9th Cir. 2000),2000,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiff Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. produced and marketed the Sony PlayStation video game console. Sony owned the copyright to BIOS, the software program that operated the PlayStation. Defendant Connectix Corporation made and sold a software program called “Virtual Game Station.” The purpose of the Virtual Game Station was to emulate on a regular computer the functioning of the Sony PlayStation console, so that computer owners who buy the Virtual Game Station software can play Sony PlayStation games on their computers. In order to create the Virtual Game Station, Connectix “reverse engineered” Sony’s BIOS program. As part of the reverse engineering process, Connectix made several intermediate copies of the BIOS program. Sony sued Connectix for copyright infringement. The district court concluded that Sony was likely to succeed on its infringement claim because Connectix’s “intermediate copying” was not a protected fair use. The court also enjoined Connectix from selling the Virtual Game Station and copying or using Sony’s BIOS program in the development of other Virtual Game Station products.",Whether Connectix’s intermediate copying of a copyright protected computer program for reverse engineering purposes qualified as fair use.,"The circuit court reversed the district court’s ruling and remanded the case with instructions to dissolve the injunction against Connectix. The court concluded that the intermediate copies Connectix made and used during the course of its reverse engineering of the BIOS program were protected fair use, necessary to permit Connectix to make its non-infringing Virtual Game Station function with PlayStation games. In reaching its conclusion, the court found that three of four fair use factors—the purpose and character of the use the nature of the copyrighted work, and the effect of the use upon the potential market for the work—all weighed in favor of fair use. Although the court found that Connectix copied the entire BIOS program, it concluded that this factor warranted “very little weight” in cases of “intermediate infringement” where “the final product does not itself contain infringing material.”",Ninth Circuit; Computer program,Fair use found
"Sony Computer Entm’t Am., Inc. v. Bleem, L.L.C.,",214 F.3d 1022 (9th Cir. 2000),2000,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiff Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc. created videogames designed to be played only on Sony PlayStations. Defendants Bleem, LLC, David Herpolsheimer, and Jaime Felix developed a computer program that made it possible to play Sony games on a standard PC, which has the capability for higher video resolution than Sony PlayStations. To demonstrate that difference, defendants included “screen shots” in advertising that compared the same scene as displayed on a PlayStation and a PC. Plaintiff sued, alleging copyright infringement and seeking an injunction to prevent defendants from using the screen shots. The district court ruled in favor of Sony, entering a preliminary injunction against Bleem. Defendants appealed the district court’s ruling that their use of the screen shots in the advertisement was not fair use.",Whether defendants’ use of screen shots comparing plaintiff’s videogames on PCs and Sony PlayStations was fair use.,"Vacating the lower court’s injunction, the circuit court held that defendants’ use of actual (as opposed to simulated) screen shots for the purpose of comparative advertising was fair use. While defendants’ use was for a commercial purpose, the court found that use of the screen shots for comparative advertising weighed in favor of fair use because it provided information to the public and would likely encourage innovation. Additionally, the court found that defendants’ use of screen shots took an insignificant portion of the work and there was not a market for the screen shots. The court further noted that, even if there was a market for screen shots, defendants’ use of “a handful” of screen shots would have no noticeable effect on the plaintiff’s ability to “do with its screen shots what it chooses.”",Ninth Circuit; Computer program,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
"Worldwide Church of God v. Phila.

Defendant Philadelphia Church of God, Inc., also a nonprofit religious organization, began copying Mystery of the Ages in its entirety and distributing large numbers of copies to its membership and to the public. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling that reproduction of the work “for non-profit religious and educational purposes” was “reasonable.”",Whether defendant’s reproduction and distribution of plaintiff’s out-of-print work was a fair use.,"Reversing the district court, the circuit court held that defendant’s use of the work was not fair use. The court determined that defendant’s reproduction of the text was neither transformative nor purely noncommercial. The court further held that, despite defendant’s classification of the text as an “historical account,” it possessed a sufficient amount of “creativity, imagination and originality” to “tilt the scale against fair use.” The court also held that defendant’s copying of the entire work weighed against a finding of fair use. Finally, the court held that defendant’s reproduction and distribution of the text would have a negative impact on both the work’s current value as a “marketing device” and the market for any future derivative versions of the text.",Ninth Circuit; Textual work,Fair use not found
"Baraban v. Time Warner, Inc.,","No. 99 Civ. 1569-JSM (S.D.N.Y. April 6, 2000)",2000,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff Joe Baraban owned the copyright in a photograph of a dairy farmer posing with a cow in a field of yellow clover. The U.S. Council for Energy Awareness (USCEA) used the photograph with the author’s permission in an advertisement supporting nuclear energy that ran in several national newspapers and magazines. Defendant Time Warner, Inc. published defendant Gerald Celente’s book, Trends 2000: How to Prepare for and Profit from the Changes of the 21st Century (Trends). The book included the advertisement along with commentary criticizing the nuclear energy industry. Defendants only slightly altered the advertisement by making it black and white, shrinking it to fit the page layout, and cropping it to exclude USCEA’s information. Defendants alleged that they were unable to get permission because USCEA apparently had ceased to exist, and they could not locate plaintiff. Plaintiff Baraban claimed that using his photograph in the book without permission infringed his copyright.","Whether the unauthorized reproduction of an advertisement including a photographer’s image, in a book criticizing the underlying subject matter of the advertisement, constituted fair use.","The court held that defendants’ use of the advertisement in Trends qualified as fair use. The court concluded that defendants’ use was clearly for purposes of criticism and comment as the book’s author used the photo to show the nature of the nuclear energy industry’s advertisements and provided additional commentary concerning those advertisements. The court rejected plaintiff’s argument that the use was satirical, not for parody. According to the court, Trends criticized the photo, at least in part, because it highlighted a particular view —the “sunny” view of nuclear power— that the industry intended to promote. The court found the second factor was neutral because while the purposeful setting, angles, and other artistic elements made the photo highly creative and weighed in plaintiff’s favor, the context of its use was as part of an advertisement, and this weighed in favor of the defendants. For the third factor, the court held that defendants’ slight modifications were enough to give the reader the sense of the campaign without completely copying the work exactly. Finally, the court held that the market value of the photograph was not harmed by the publication in Trends, since it was unlikely that a black-and-white, comparatively miniscule version would negatively affect a market, the existence of which was already “dubious.”",Second Circuit; Photograph; Review/Commentary; Textual work,Fair use found

(Nikkei) published financial, business, and industry newspapers in both English and Japanese. Nikkei sold and licensed its newspapers and articles throughout the world in both Japanese and in translation. Defendants, Comline Business Data, Inc. and associated private parties, gathered news articles from a variety of sources and sold “abstracts” of them, which they sometimes translated into English. Of the 17,000 abstracts published by defendants in 1997, approximately one-third were derived from plaintiff’s news sources. Defendants appealed the district court’s decision that they were not entitled to a fair use defense.",Whether defendants’ copying and translation of plaintiff’s news articles constituted fair use.,"The appeals court ruled that defendants’ abstracting and translating plaintiff’s works for sale to its customers was not fair use. Acknowledging that defendants’ abstracts were for the purpose of news reporting, the court nonetheless found that the purpose and character of its use went against a finding of fair use because it was “not in the least ‘transformative’” since the abstracts were for the most part direct translations with little or no new expression added. The court found that, qualitatively and quantitatively, defendants’ abstracts took a substantial portion of plaintiff’s works because they were often word-for-word translations with the exact same structure and organization as plaintiff’s articles. The court further found that defendants’ abstracts competed with and superseded plaintiff’s articles in the marketplace, and concluded that the negative effect on the potential market for plaintiff’s works was great.",Second Circuit; News reporting; Textual work,Fair use not found
"Tiffany Design, Inc. v. Reno-Tahoe Specialty, Inc.,",55 F. Supp. 2d 1113 (D. Nev. 1999),1999,United State District Court for the District of Nevada,"Both parties, plaintiff Tiffany Design, Inc. and defendant Reno-Tahoe Specialty, Inc., produced and distributed postcards and other “novelty items.” Plaintiff Tiffany Design claimed to own the copyright in a digitally rendered image of the Las Vegas Strip that it incorporated into certain products. Defendant Reno-Tahoe reproduced Tiffany Design’s image of the Las Vegas Strip and incorporated portions of it into its own products.",Whether Reno-Tahoe’s unauthorized reproduction and incorporation of portions of Tiffany Design’s image into its products was fair use.,"The court held that Reno-Tahoe failed to “meet its burden in establishing the applicability of the defense of fair use to its alleged misconduct.” In reaching its conclusion, the court weighed its determination that Reno-Tahoe’s use was commercial and not transformative against a finding of fair use. The court also relied on its determination that Reno-Tahoe’s use “might have great effect upon commercial demand for [Tiffany’s] depictions of the Las Vegas Strip.”",Ninth Circuit; Painting/Drawing/Graphic; Photograph,Fair use not found
"Castle Rock Entm’t, Inc. v. Carol Publ. Group, Inc.,",150 F.3d 132 (2d Cir. 1998),1998,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. owned the copyrights for the entire Seinfeld television series. Defendants, author Beth B. Golub and publisher Carol Publishing Group, Inc., released a book titled The Seinfeld Aptitude Test (The SAT), a 132-page book that contained 643 trivia questions and answers about the characters and events in Seinfeld. The book drew from eighty-four of the eighty-six Seinfeld episodes broadcast up to that time and included direct quotes. The district court ruled against defendants, finding that this was not fair use. Defendants appealed.",Whether defendants’ use of copyright protected aspects of a television series to create a trivia book for fans of the series constituted fair use.,"The Second Circuit held that defendants’ unauthorized use of the copyright protected aspects of the television series was not fair use. The court determined that defendants’ use was commercial and, more importantly, non- transformative because The SAT did not provide commentary or analysis about Seinfeld or act as a research tool, but instead “[repackaged] Seinfeld to entertain Seinfeld viewers.” The court then noted that defendants’ creation of 643 questions based on the television series was more than was necessary to advance defendants’ purported “commentary” of the show, further suggesting that the book’s purpose was entertainment. Turning to the effect on the potential market, the court found that although Castle Rock had shown little interest in exploiting the market for Seinfeld-related books, the defendants’ work substituted for the derivative market for such books, and the court noted that “copyright law must respect [the] creative and economic choice” of plaintiffs not to exploit a particular market.",Second Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Textual work,Fair use not found
"Infinity Broad. Corp. v. Kirkwood,",150 F.3d 104 (2d Cir. 1998),1998,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff Infinity Broadcasting Corp. owned the copyrights to numerous radio broadcast programs. Defendant Wayne Kirkwood operated Media Dial-Up (Dial-Up), which allowed customers to listen to “contemporaneous radio broadcasts in remote cities” over the telephone for a fee. Plaintiff filed an infringement suit claiming Dial-Up was illegally retransmitting its copyright protected broadcasts. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling that defendant’s unauthorized use of plaintiff’s broadcasts was fair.","Whether defendant’s retransmission of plaintiff’s copyright protected broadcasts to allow customers to listen to contemporaneous radio broadcasts in remote cities, for a fee, constituted fair use.","On appeal, the court held that defendant’s retransmission was not fair use, finding that “all four statutory factors point toward infringement.” In conducting its fair use analysis, the court found that the possible benefits that defendant’s customers could derive from defendant’s retransmissions of the copyrighted broadcasts were “outweighed by the total absence of transformativeness” in the retransmissions themselves, which left “the character of the original broadcasts unchanged.” Specifically, the court noted that “a change of format, though useful, is not technically a transformation.” The court also found that defendant’s service potentially allowed for the retransmission of entire copyrighted broadcasts; that defendant’s retransmissions could replace plaintiff as the supplier in the market; and that plaintiff was exclusively entitled to exploit the broadcasts in the market.",Second Circuit; Format shifting/Space shifting; Music,Fair use not found
"Leibovitz v. Paramount Pictures Corp.,",137 F.3d 109 (2d Cir. 1998),1998,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff Annie Leibovitz took a famous nude photograph of then-pregnant actress Demi Moore for the August 1991 cover of Vanity Fair. Defendant Paramount, in connection with its forthcoming release of the motion picture Naked Gun 33 1/3, produced advertising material that included a head shot of Leslie Nielsen superimposed onto the body of a nude pregnant woman posed similarly to Demi Moore. When Leibovitz sued for copyright infringement, Paramount asserted the fair use defense, claiming the work was a parody. Leibovitz appealed the district court’s ruling that defendant’s use of plaintiff’s Demi Moore photograph was fair use.",Whether the unauthorized recreation of aspects of plaintiff’s photograph to promote the release of a motion picture constituted a fair use.,"The court upheld the district court’s ruling that defendant’s use of the original photo was a fair use parody of the original. Noting that a commercial use is not presumptively unfair, the court found that the parodic nature of the advertisement weighed in favor of a finding of fair use. In addition, the court found that, under Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 (1994), copying more than what was necessary to “conjure up” the original work would not necessarily weigh against fair use for parodies, and held that defendant’s extensive copying was for the purpose of parodying the original photograph. Finally the court found that the parody did not serve as a market substitute, especially since plaintiff conceded that the use did not interfere with any potential market for the original or derivative works.",Second Circuit; Parody/Satire; Photograph,Fair use found
"Sundeman v. The Seajay Soc’y, Inc.,",142 F.3d 194 (4th Cir. 1998),1998,United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,"Plaintiffs the Florida Foundation and John Sundeman, personal representative of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Marjorie Rawlings’ estate, alleged that defendant The Seajay Society, Inc. infringed Rawlings’ unpublished work, Blood of My Blood. After Rawlings died, her literary executrix took physical possession of Rawlings’ papers, including Blood of My Blood. When the executrix also died, Rawlings’ estate did not take possession of the collection. Eventually defendant, a nonprofit organization devoted to enhancing public interest in southern culture, came into possession of Blood of My Blood. Defendant made a complete copy of the unpublished novel available to a Seajay Society officer and scholar specializing in Rawlings’ works. Defendant also sent a partial copy to the University of Florida Library to evaluate it for publication and make it available to plaintiffs. The scholar wrote a critical review of the unpublished novel that she orally presented to the Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings Society and which she planned to use as an introduction if the novel was published. The presentation quoted 2,464 words or four- to six- percent of the total novel. Plaintiffs appealed the district court’s ruling that defendant’s distribution of copies and use of quoted material was fair use.","Whether defendant’s unauthorized distribution of an unpublished novel and use of quoted material from it, for purposes relating to literary criticism and seeking permission to publish it, constituted fair use.","The court ruled in favor of defendant’s fair use defense, finding that the critical review was a scholarly appraisal of the work. While the paper extensively quoted or paraphrased the novel, its underlying purpose was to comment and criticize the work. The court also found that, while the scholar hoped to profit from the review, she used her copy of the novel to pursue a scholarly objective and as a means of preserving the delicate original. Further, she did not publish the review after failing to obtain appropriate permissions, so there was no commercial gain in this case. The court therefore found that the challenged uses of the manuscript were for noncommercial, educational purposes. The court rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the unpublished nature of the work completely barred a fair use defense because Congress amended 17 U.S.C. 107 in 1992 to explicitly bring unpublished works within the purview of fair use analysis. The court then found that defendant’s use of the work did not usurp plaintiffs’ right of first publication because neither the purpose nor the effect of the copies amounted to anything resembling first publication. It also ruled that the scholar did not quote more than was necessary to effectively comment or criticize the work. Finally, the court found that defendant’s uses had minimal effect on the market or potential market for plaintiffs’ work.",Fourth Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Review/Commentary; Textual work; Unpublished,Fair use found
"L.A. News Serv. v. Reuters Television Int’l, Ltd.,",149 F.3d 987 (9th Cir. 1998),1998,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiff Los Angeles News Service (LANS) licensed its news stories, photographs, audiovisual works, and other services to other news media outlets. While covering the 1992 Los Angeles riots, LANS filmed several segments of nighttime rioting, including the iconic segment titled Beating of Reginald Denny. Defendant Reuters recorded plaintiff’s broadcast and transmitted it to its overseas subscribers. Defendant appealed the district court’s ruling that the fair use defense did not shield its actions.",Whether defendant’s unauthorized recording and transmission of plaintiff’s footage to defendant’s overseas subscribers constituted fair use.,"The Ninth Circuit upheld the lower court’s decision that defendant’s recording and subsequent transmission of plaintiff’s broadcast for the purpose of reporting the news was not a fair use. Despite the fact that plaintiff’s works were factual in nature and had been previously published, the court found that defendant’s commercial use of the “heart” of the works was not very transformative. Additionally, while plaintiff was unable to prove the loss of subsequent sales, the court found that if defendant’s actions were permitted, they “would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential market for the original works,” because an organization purchasing news footage from defendant would no longer need to purchase it from plaintiff, thus “lessening the market” for plaintiff’s footage.",Ninth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; News reporting,Fair use not found
"Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc. v. Miramax Films Corp.,",11 F. Supp. 2d 1179 (C.D. Cal. 1998),1998,United States District Court for the Central District of California,"Defendant Miramax Films Corp. created an advertising poster and trailer for the Michael Moore documentary The Big One that incorporated elements of advertising previously used for the film Men In Black. Posters for both films featured figures carrying a large object standing in front of a nighttime New York skyline, and used similar colors and layout. The two films’ trailers had “a virtually identical theme, format, pace, and sequence of events,” and used the same music. Defendant admitted that the advertising campaign for The Big One was intended to parody Men In Black. Plaintiff Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. filed for a preliminary injunction, alleging that defendant’s poster and trailer infringed its copyright for Men In Black.",Whether defendant’s use of expressive elements from the Men In Black advertising poster and trailers in an advertising poster and trailer for a documentary constituted fair use.,"The court granted the injunction, holding that defendant failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of its fair use defense. It held that defendant’s advertisements were not transformative because they “cannot reasonably be perceived as commenting on or criticizing the ads for ‘Men In Black’” because they merely incorporated elements of plaintiff’s advertisements. The court further held that the amount and substantiality of the portion used was not reasonable, finding that defendant’s proffered justifications were unpersuasive given the non-transformative nature of the use. Finally, the court held that defendant failed to meet its burden of providing affirmative evidence relating to market harm.",Ninth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Painting/Drawing/Graphic; Parody/Satire,Fair use not found
"Lucent Info. Mgmt. v. Lucent Techs., Inc.,",5 F. Supp. 2d 238 (D.

(LIM), which sold computer document management systems, had sued defendant Lucent Technologies, Inc., a supplier of telecommunication and information systems. Plaintiff’s copyright infringement claim arose during the discovery phase of the trademark litigation. To bolster its trademark defense, defendant had conducted a business survey to test the name “Lucent,” which involved sending different survey letters to businesses and following up with a telephone interview. One of the letters defendant used for its survey was “an almost exact duplicate” of a copyright protected letter owned by LIM.",Whether defendant’s unauthorized reproduction of substantial portions of plaintiff’s letter and letterhead for a survey during the discovery phase of litigation was fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s use of plaintiff's copyrighted letter was fair use. In reaching its conclusion, the court relied on its findings that defendants only used plaintiff’s letter as part of its preparation for litigation, and that plaintiff did not claim that it was profiting from or that customers were willing to buy copies of the letter. The court also relied on its findings that the letter was not meant to be “creative or original” and “merely communicates” facts.",Third Circuit; Textual work; Used in government proceeding,Fair use found
"Duffy v. Penguin Books USA, Inc.,",4 F. Supp. 2d 268 (S.D.N.Y. 1998),1989,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff Mary Duffy authored two out-of-print fashion books titled The H-O- A-X Fashion Formula and The Complete Petite. Defendants Susan Nanfeldt and Penguin Books USA, Inc. wrote and published Plus Style: The Plus-Size Guide to Looking Great (PSGLG). While researching and writing PSGLG, Nanfeldt visited a library and made unauthorized photocopies of portions of at least one of plaintiff’s two out-of-print books. Plaintiff alleged that defendant Nanfeldt infringed by making unauthorized photocopies.",Whether photocopying an unidentified portion of an out-of-print book for purposes of research to create a book on the same topic constituted fair use.,"The court ruled that Nanfeldt’s reproduction of portions of Duffy’s work qualified as fair use. While the court held that the third factor weighed in plaintiff’s favor, because evidence of the amount copied was disputed, the other three factors favored defendants. For the first factor, although PSGLG was intended to be marketed commercially, Nanfeldt only copied plaintiff’s work for research purposes. Additionally, the second factor favored defendants because plaintiff’s works were published and therefore should be afforded narrower protection than unpublished works. The court also ruled that, because plaintiff’s works were out-of-print at the time, she did not lose any commercial benefits as a result of the photocopying.",Second Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Format shifting/Space shifting; Textual work; Unpublished,Fair use found
"Ringgold v. Black Entm’t Television, Inc.,",126 F.3d 70 (2d Cir. 1997),1997,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff Faith Ringgold complained that defendants Black Entertainment Television, Inc. and Home Box Office, Inc. infringed her copyright by using a poster depicting her Church Picnic Story Quilt (Church Picnic) in a set designed for a sitcom television series that aired on their networks. Church Picnic is a “silk screen on silk quilt” painting that depicts the thoughts of a parishioner at a 1909 Sunday school picnic held by the Freedom Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia. The actual work is owned by The High Museum of Art in Atlanta, to which plaintiff granted a non-exclusive license to reproduce Church Picnic as a poster. In the television episode at issue, the poster appears several times in a church scene where characters are waiting for a recital. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling that including the poster in the set design without permission was fair use.",Whether defendants’ unauthorized use of a poster depicting plaintiff’s work to decorate a television set constituted fair use.,"Reversing the district court, the court of appeals ruled that defendants’ use of the poster depicting plaintiff’s work was not fair use. The appeals court criticized the district court’s flawed analysis of the impact on the market for the work, saying it wrongly required plaintiff to show actual harm, such as a drop in licensing requests, where she was only required to identify a traditional, reasonable or likely-to-be-developed market for licensing her work. For its analysis, the appeals court determined that defendants’ use was not transformative since the work was used in the manner that plaintiff originally intended —as decorative art work. The court further found that defendants’ use could have a substantially adverse impact on the potential market for the original work, especially given that plaintiff presented evidence of the existence of a market for the exact use at issue, licensing the work as a poster for dressing set designs.",Second Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Painting/Drawing/Graphic; Photograph,Fair use not found
"Dr. Seuss Enters., LP v. Penguin Books USA, Inc.,",109 F.3d 1394 (9th Cir. 1997),1997,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Defendants, Penguin Books and Dove Audio, Inc., were book publishers who sought to publish and distribute a book titled The Cat NOT in the Hat! A Parody by Dr. Juice, a rhyming summary of the O.J. Simpson trial. Plaintiff Dr. Seuss Enterprises, LP owned most of the copyright and trademark rights for the children’s books written and illustrated by Theodor S. Geisel under the pseudonym “Dr. Seuss,” including The Cat in the Hat. Defendants were not authorized to use any element of plaintiff’s original books and did not attempt to obtain permission. Defendants’ book had many similarities to the original work, including rhyme scheme, thematic and narrative elements, and certain chief character identifiers, such as the distinctive red and white striped hat. Plaintiff filed suit, and the district court granted a preliminary injunction. Defendants filed an interlocutory appeal.","Whether unauthorized copying of an original work’s artistic style, plot, themes, and certain key character elements qualified as fair use.","The Ninth Circuit concluded that the district court’s finding that plaintiff had shown a likelihood of success on the merits was not clearly erroneous, in light of fair use analysis of defendants’ work, and affirmed the preliminary injunction. First, the court found that the use was not transformative. The work was not a parody, because it did not hold up Dr. Seuss’s style, but merely mimicked it to attract attention or avoid the difficult work of developing original material. Furthermore, according to the court there was “no effort to create a transformative work with ‘new expression, meaning, or message.’” Second, the court found that the creative, imaginative and original nature of plaintiff’s work weighed against fair use. Third, the court found that defendant had copied substantial portions, because the character of the cat, used in both works, was the “highly expressive core” of plaintiff’s work. Other principal thematic and narrative elements were also copied. Finally, because the use was commercial and non-transformative, harm to the market for the original work could be more readily inferred. Further, because fair use is an affirmative defense, and defendants failed to submit evidence on the fourth factor, this disentitled defendants from relief from the preliminary injunction.",Ninth Circuit; Parody/Satire; Textual work,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"

While covering the 1992 Los Angeles riots, LANS filmed several segments of nighttime rioting, including the iconic segment titled Beating of Reginald Denny. Although LANS refused to grant defendant Channel 9 television station a license, the station broadcast the footage a number of times on commercially sponsored news programs. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s holding that defendant was entitled to the fair use defense because the footage depicted a newsworthy event.","Whether, for the purpose of news reporting, it was a fair use for defendant to use plaintiff’s copyrighted footage of a riot without permission.","The Ninth Circuit reversed the lower court, finding that all factors weighed against a finding of fair use. The court found that while defendant’s use of the tape was arguably in the public interest because it was footage of a newsworthy event, the use was still commercial because defendant was in the business of gathering and selling news and competed with other stations for advertising dollars. Additionally, the court found that defendant’s airing of the footage with a voiceover failed to add anything new or transformative, and that although only thirty seconds of a four-minute video were used, it was still the “heart” of the work. Finally, the court found that defendant’s use of the footage could also potentially have a negative impact on plaintiff’s primary market, especially in light of defendant’s initial request to license the work.",Ninth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; News reporting,Fair use not found
"Princeton Univ. Press v. Mich. Document Servs., Inc.,",99 F.3d 1381 (6th Cir. 1996),1996,United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,"Defendant Michigan Document Services, Inc. is a commercial photocopy shop that reproduced substantial segments of written materials that were assigned reading for University of Michigan courses. Defendant assembled the photocopied material into “coursepacks” that it offered for sale to students for use in their studies to fulfill reading assignments. Plaintiffs are publishers who owned copyrights for the assigned reading materials defendant used to create the coursepacks. The publishers asserted that defendant photocopy shop was prohibited from copying and distributing their works without their permission. Defendant appealed the district court’s ruling that using the copyrighted works in the coursepacks was not protected by the fair use doctrine.",Whether defendant photocopy shop’s unauthorized reproduction and distribution of plaintiffs’ copyright protected works for use as assigned student course material constituted fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s commercial exploitation of the protected works did not constitute fair use. In its analysis, the court weighed the fact that defendant was a “commercial enterprise” copying protected works “on a profit-making basis” against a finding of fair use. The court clarified that while the educational use to which students put the course packs was noncommercial in nature, the challenged use in this case was the defendant’s unauthorized commercial duplication of plaintiffs’ copyrighted works. The court found defendant’s non-transformative, verbatim copying would cause a significant adverse impact on the potential market for the works. Factoring into the court’s decision was its finding that there was an established market in which copyright owners frequently licensed segments of their works to copy shops for reproduction and sale to students and that, should defendant’s conduct become widespread, plaintiffs’ licensing revenue stream would “shrivel.” Also weighing against a finding of fair use were the court’s findings that some of the works contained in the course packs were excerpts of creative material; that the length of most of the segments included in the course packs (in relation to entire versions) were “not insubstantial;” and that the qualitative value of the excerpts was high in light of the fact that it is normal practice for professors to choose the most important or significant portions of materials.",Sixth Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual work,Fair use not found

In addition, defendant marketed and sold video game copying devices that allowed users to copy, upload, and play unauthorized copies of plaintiff’s games.",Whether the operator of an online file-sharing system which allowed users to upload and download video games for their private home use constituted fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s operation of the file sharing system did not constitute fair use. First, the court found that the use was clearly commercial, with no evidence that the copying was for creative or transformative purposes. Second, the court found that the nature of plaintiff’s games, which were created for entertainment and not informational purposes, weighed against a finding of fair use. Third, the court found that defendant and his customers copied “virtually” entire games without demonstrating any public benefit. Fourth, the court found defendant and his customers’ copying of plaintiff’s games served no substantial purpose other than the unauthorized reproduction of the games, allowing users to avoid purchasing the games.",Ninth Circuit; Computer program; Internet/Digitization,Fair use not found
"Monster Commc’ns, Inc. v. Turner Broad. Sys., Inc.,",935 F. Supp. 490 (S.D.N.Y. 1996),1996,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff Monster Communications, Inc. owned the film rights for the movie When We Were Kings (Kings) that contained historic footage documenting the 1974 title boxing match, often called the “Rumble in the Jungle,” between Mohammed Ali and George Foreman. Defendant Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. made the documentary Ali—The Whole Story (Story), which contained “a number of film clips, aggregating approximately between forty- one seconds and two minutes, that appear in Kings and allegedly are owned by Monster.” Plaintiff sued Turner for infringing its copyright in the historic film footage, seeking to enjoin the company from exhibiting the documentary.",Whether defendant would be likely to establish that its use of plaintiff’s historic film footage in a documentary constituted fair use.,"The court denied plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief because it concluded that defendant was likely to prevail on its argument that use of the historic footage in its documentary was a fair use. In reaching that conclusion, the court found that defendant’s work, while commercial in nature, “undeniably constitute[d] a combination of comment, criticism, scholarship and research.” The court also determined that the amount used weighed in favor of finding fair use because the footage used was not the focus of defendant’s documentary. Additionally, the court found that defendant’s use of the footage was unlikely to harm the market for plaintiff’s work because the use was “too few, too short, and too small in relation to the whole. If the broadcast of [Story] impacts [Kings’] reception, it almost surely will be as a result of their common subject, not the minute or so of common footage.” Finally, the historic nature of the allegedly infringed films clips also supported a finding of fair use.",Second Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Film/Audiovisual; Review/Commentary,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"

They alleged that Texaco’s four to five hundred employees infringed their copyrights by repeatedly photocopying individual journal articles without permission and distributing them widely. The district court allowed this interlocutory appeal after ruling it was not fair use for employees to copy plaintiffs’ journal articles.",Whether it was fair use for a company’s employees to photocopy articles from subscription journals that related to their work.,"Affirming the district court, the Second Circuit held that defendant’s unauthorized copying of the journal articles was not fair use. In reaching its conclusion, the court found that defendant’s actions were “part of a systematic process of encouraging employee researchers to copy articles so as to multiply available copies while avoiding payment.” Specifically, the court found that employees were simply making copies for convenience, which it did not consider to be a transformative use. Further, the court found that the employees were copying articles in their entirety, and such copying interfered with the commercial value publishers derive from the articles via subscriptions and licensing agreements.",Second Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual work,Fair use not found

Cal. 1995),1995,United States Court of Appeals for the Central District of California,"To advertise a new convertible model with a detachable roof, defendants, Honda and its advertising firm, made a commercial featuring a fast-paced scene in which a menacing villain in a helicopter chases a suave hero and attractive heroine who are driving the new convertible model. Plaintiff MGM (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.) filed a motion for a preliminary injunction alleging that defendants infringed its copyrights to sixteen James Bond films as well as the James Bond character. Defendants raised the fair use defense.",Whether defendants’ commercial was a parody that was protected under the fair use defense.,"The court granted MGM a preliminary injunction, ruling against defendants’ fair use defense. The court disagreed with defendants’ assertion that the commercial was a parody of the action film genre, and also cited Campbell v. Acufff-Rose, 510 U.S. 569 (1994), which indicated that using a copyrighted work in an advertising parody should weigh more against fair use than if the parody was sold for its own sake. As a result, the lack of parody and commercial nature of the advertisement weighed against a finding of fair use. The court also determined that MGM should prevail on the second factor because its creative films are close to the core of copyright protection. For the third factor, the court found that the brevity of the use did not excuse defendants’ copying since it was not a parody. Finally, on the fourth factor, the court determined that the association with a “low-end Honda model” would likely threaten the value of the James Bond character to upscale licensees.",Ninth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Parody/Satire,Fair use not found
"Robinson v. Random House, Inc.,",877 F. Supp. 830 (S.D.N.Y. 1995),1995,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff Jack Robinson admitted that his manuscript American Icarus: The Majestic Rise and Tragic Fall of Pan Am appropriated either “verbatim or through close paraphrasing” at least twenty-five to thirty percent of defendant Random House, Inc.’s book on the same topic, American Saga: Juan Trippe and His Pan Am Empire. Plaintiff added only an introduction and three concluding chapters. Because defendant refused to publish plaintiff’s infringing work and refused to grant plaintiff permission to use its copyrighted material, plaintiff asked the court to declare that his manuscript did not infringe defendant’s work.",Whether plaintiff’s copying from defendant’s nonfiction manuscript for his own nonfiction account of the same or closely related historical events was fair use.,"After determining that the material taken by plaintiff was in fact protected by copyright, the court granted defendant’s motion for summary judgment, finding that “[g]iven the undisputed facts and the obvious extent of wholesale copying in this case, it is clear that no reasonable jury could make a finding of fair use.” While the nature of defendant’s work as a nonfiction historical work weighed in favor of fair use, the court found plaintiff’s use of the work to be little more than a non-transformative “updated abridgement” of defendant’s book. The court further found that plaintiff’s work harmed existing and potential markets for defendant’s work by acting as a mere market substitute for the original.",Second Circuit; Textual work,Fair use not found
"Rotbart v. J.R. O’Dwyer Co., Inc.,","No. 94 Civ. 2091 (JSM) (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 1995)",1995,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiffs, TJFR Publishing Co. and its president, Dean Rotbart, published multiple newsletters about journalists. Plaintiffs also offered seminars to public relations executives for which the audience was usually required to sign confidentiality agreements. Defendants, J.R. O’Dwyer Co., Inc. and its principal, Jack O’Dwyer, edited and published two magazines about public relations (PR). At a national conference, plaintiff Rotbart addressed an audience of PR professionals, including defendant O’Dwyer, without requiring a confidentiality agreement. Defendants subsequently published multiple articles and editorials on the speech, quoting and paraphrasing parts of the talk. Defendants also distributed transcripts that they had created from a tape recording of plaintiff’s speech.",Whether publishing editorials that quoted and paraphrased portions of a public speech and distributing transcripts of the speech was fair use.,"The court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss, finding that defendants’ publication of articles discussing plaintiff’s public speech and defendants’ distribution of the transcripts constituted fair use. The court held that defendants’ purposes were to fairly and reasonably review, comment on, and criticize plaintiff’s speech. The court deemed these goals to outweigh the fact that the publication was commercial in nature. The court also found defendants’ articles to be transformative because they sufficiently altered and provided new insight on plaintiff’s work. Furthermore, the transcripts of the speech were not published for commercial gain, but merely to prove the accuracy of the quotations. The court also found that the initial errors in transcribing the speech were not deliberate distortions and, therefore, did not implicate the first factor. In terms of the second factor, the court determined that it favored the defendants because, although it was indeed a creative expression and technically unpublished, plaintiff de facto published the speech because it was open to the public upon payment of a fee and was given to more than two hundred people, of which he was aware that two reporters were a part. Citing Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 (1994), the court also found the third and fourth factors to favor the defendants. The court reasoned that even though defendants copied the “heart” of plaintiff’s speech, defendant O’Dwyer, as a reporter, naturally chose the most significant parts of the speech on which to report. The court also found that the news report did not act as a market substitute nor did plaintiff argue that it affected the speech’s value.",Second Circuit; Format shifting/Space shifting; News reporting; Review/commentary; Textual work; Unpublished,Fair use found
"Nat'l Rifle Ass’n of Am. v. Handgun Control Fed’n of Ohio,",15 F.3d 559 (6th Cir. 1994),1994,United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,"Plaintiff the National Rifle Association of America (NRA), which lobbies officials and educates the public in support of the ownership of firearms, mailed two letters to its membership urging them to oppose bills pending in the Ohio state legislature. Accompanying each letter was a three-page list of all Ohio state legislators and their corresponding contact information. The list included asterisks next to the names of members of legislative committees relevant to the pending bills. A short paragraph explaining why certain names had been marked with asterisks was at the bottom of the list. In response, defendant Handgun Control Federation of Ohio, which advocated gun control, mailed a letter to its members urging them to support the bills plaintiff opposed. Attached to defendant’s letter was the photocopied, though slightly modified, listing of Ohio State legislators that plaintiff used in its mailing. Defendant appealed the district court’s ruling in plaintiff’s favor.",Whether defendant’s unauthorized duplication and use of plaintiff’s list of state legislators constitutes fair use.,"The court held that the defendant’s use of the list of legislators was fair. The court found that the first and fourth factors weighed in favor of finding fair use, reasoning that defendant, a non-profit organization, had made a noncommercial use of the legislator list with no attempt to sell it. Further, the court noted that the list contained information so readily attainable that no market likely existed for it, and found that the distribution—to only 200 people—was not particularly damaging. The court also found that the document was used primarily to exercise defendant’s First Amendment speech rights to comment on public issues and to petition the government regarding pending legislation. Indicating that the scope of the fair use doctrine is wider when the use relates to issues of public concern, the court found that this factor weighed in defendant’s favor. Finally, for the second and third factors, the court found that the list at issue was entirely factual and that defendant copied only the list and not the copyrighted NRA letters, weighing in favor of fair use.",Sixth Circuit; Textual work,Fair use found
"Norse v. Henry Holt & Co.,",847 F. Supp. 142 (N.D. Cal. 1994),1994,United States District Court for the Northern District of California,"Defendant Henry Holt & Co. published defendant Ted Morgan’s biography of author William S. Burroughs entitled Literary Outlaw: The Life and Times of William S. Burroughs. Morgan quoted several short phrases, about fifty words in total, from unpublished letters written by plaintiff Harold Norse. Plaintiff sued for copyright infringement, and defendants asserted that copying short phrases was not actionable under copyright law. On appeal, the circuit court remanded the case for the district court to consider defendants’ fair use defense.",Whether defendants’ unauthorized use of excerpts from plaintiff’s unpublished work constituted fair use.,"On remand, the district court concluded that defendants’ copying of short phrases was fair use. Although the defendants’ commercial use and the unpublished nature of plaintiff’s letters weighed against a finding of fair use, the court found that the use did not exploit the publicity value of the quoted material and was only minimally commercial. Additionally, the court found that no reasonable juror could conclude that the small amount of “copied material goes to the ‘heart,’ if one can even be identified, of the copyrighted letters.” Finally, the court found that even if there was a market for plaintiff’s unpublished letters, defendants’ small and fragmentary “use of the copied material in no way supplants that market.”",Ninth Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual work; Unpublished,Fair use found
"Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.,",510 U.S. 569 (1994),1994,Supreme Court of the United States,"Plaintiff-respondent, a music publisher and co-owner of the Roy Orbison 1964 rock ballad Oh, Pretty Woman, accused defendants-petitioners, hip-hop group 2 Live Crew, of infringing Orbison’s song by releasing a 1989 parody version titled Pretty Woman. Upholding the lower court, the Sixth Circuit ruled that the parody was not fair use and that its commercial nature rendered it presumptively unfair. It also found that by using the “heart” of the original as the “heart” of the parody, 2 Live Crew took too much, establishing market harm by presumption. Defendants appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.",Whether the lower court erred in ruling that the commercial nature of defendant’s parody of plaintiff’s work rendered the use presumptively unfair.,"The Court reversed the Sixth Circuit, finding that it had erred in giving dispositive weight to the commercial nature of 2 Live Crew’s parody and in applying an evidentiary presumption that the commercial nature of the parody rendered it unfair. The Court held that the commercial or nonprofit educational purpose of a work is only one element of its purpose and character. Like other uses, parody “has to work its way through the relevant factors, and be judged case by case, in light of the ends of the copyright law.” The Court commented that it is essential for someone doing a parody to be able to quote from existing material and use some of the elements of a prior work to create a new one that comments on the original. The case was remanded for further proceedings.",U.S. Supreme Court; Music; Parody/Satire,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
"Twin Peaks Prods., Inc. v. Publ’ns Int’l, Ltd.,",996 F.2d 1366 (2d Cir. 1993),1993,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff Twin Peaks Productions, Inc. owned the television serial drama Twin Peaks that was first televised in 1990. Defendant Publications International, Ltd. published a book titled “Welcome to Twin Peaks: A Complete Guide to Who’s Who and What’s What.” Defendant’s book, based on the first eight episodes of the television series, contained content discussing various aspects of the series, including the series’ characters, creators, producers, location, music, and popularity. Beyond this, the book contained a chapter devoted to the detailed recounting of the first eight episodes’ plots. Defendant appealed the district court’s ruling that its book infringed plaintiff’s work.",Whether defendant’s use of a copyright protected television series to create a book based on the series was fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s unauthorized use of aspects of the television series was not fair use. The court found that defendant’s detailed recounting of the show’s plotlines went far beyond merely identifying their basic outline for the transformative purposes of comment or criticism. The court found that the plot synopses contained in defendant’s book were essentially “abridgments,” which are protected as derivative works. Because the plot synopses were so detailed, and in fact lifted many sections verbatim from the original scripts, the court found that defendant copied a substantial amount of plaintiff’s original works. The court also found that the defendant’s book affected the market or potential market for plaintiff’s protected work because a viewer may potentially use defendant’s detailed plot synopses as a substitute for viewing particular episodes of the series. Finally, there was evidence of an active derivative market for the original copyrighted work—plaintiff had licensed at least two “Twin Peaks” books and had plans to license more— demonstrating that the defendant’s book competes in plaintiff’s markets.",Second Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Film/Audiovisual; Review/Commentary; Textual work,Fair use not found

Apr. 22, 1993)",1993,United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,"Plaintiff, owner of a contested piece of property, purchased a copyrighted house plan, made modifications to the plan, and initiated construction of a home on that property. Prior to completion, the property and incomplete house were conveyed to plaintiff’s ex-wife, pursuant to a court order. The ex-wife finished constructing the house with the assistance of defendant landscape architect, using the plan plaintiff had purchased and modified. Defendant made several copies of the plan to obtain required permits and to complete construction. Plaintiff claimed that defendant’s copies infringed his copyright in the modifications he made to the original plan. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling in defendant’s favor.",Whether defendant’s use of plaintiff’s modified architectural plans to finish construction of a house constituted a fair use.,"Upon weighing the statutory fair use factors, the court held that defendant’s use of the architectural plans was fair. The court found that defendant did not intend to use the plans for commercial purposes, but that he reproduced the plan for the sole purpose of finishing construction of the house. The court also found that the architectural work was more factual than creative in nature, weighing in favor of a finding of fair use. The court noted that the defendant’s wholesale copying of the plans weighed against a finding of fair use. However, the court found that the plans were copied and used only for purposes of completing the house and not for purposes of competing with plaintiff in the market.",Fourth Circuit; Painting/Drawing/Graphic,Fair use found
"Television Digest, Inc. v. U.S. Tel. Ass’n,",841 F. Supp. 5 (D.D.C. 1993),1993,United States District Court for the District of Columbia,"Plaintiff Television Digest, Inc. published a daily trade newsletter for the telecommunications industry titled Communications Daily (CD). Defendant U.S. Telephone Association (USTA) was the national trade association for local exchange telephone companies. USTA purchased and later renewed a single CD subscription. Defendant photocopied CD daily, making between twelve and twenty-six copies per business day, and distributed the copies to its staff. Plaintiff alleged that USTA’s daily photocopying of CD infringed their copyright interest.","Whether photocopying a daily newsletter, for which only a single subscription was paid, and distributing copies to staff members was fair use.","The court held that USTA’s photocopying and distribution of CD to staff was not fair use. First, the court rejected USTA’s argument that its use of CD was for educational and news reporting purposes. Instead, it determined that USTA’s use was commercial because the copying saved USTA the costs of paying for multiple subscriptions. The court clarified that USTA’s status as a non-profit did not compel a finding of fair use. Second, the court found that CD was copyrightable because each issue contained original stories; however, these stories cited information in the public domain, thereby making CD content less protected than creative or literary works. Third, USTA copied entire issues of plaintiff’s work each day. The court rejected USTA’s argument that its copying was merely for time-shifting purposes because a newsletter may be put aside and read at any time. Finally, the court held that, regardless of USTA’s testimony that it would not have purchased additional subscriptions, USTA saved a significant amount of money by not doing so. Therefore, USTA’s copying negatively affected the market for plaintiff’s works.",District of Columbia Circuit; Format shifting/Space shifting; News reporting; Textual work,Fair use not found
"Arica Inst., Inc. v. Palmer,",970 F.2d 1067 (2d Cir. 1992),1992,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff Arica Institute, Inc. owned the copyrights for approximately forty- seven self-help training manuals, books, and journals based on the teachings of its founder, Oscar Ichazo. Plaintiff maintained the materials at special training centers, and required trainees to return the materials after use. Defendants, author Helen Palmer and Harper & Row Publishers, Inc., published The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others in Your Life. That book contained three short passages that were substantially similar to passages in one of Ichazo’s books, and also adopted the labeling conventions of charts in plaintiff’s books. Plaintiff claimed that defendants violated its copyrights, while defendants claimed fair use.",Whether defendants’ unauthorized copying of several text passages and labeling conventions from plaintiff’s copyrighted works constituted fair use.,"The court held that defendants’ unauthorized use of the copyright-protected aspects of plaintiff’s works constituted fair use. The court found that, the concurrent commercial purpose of defendant’s work notwithstanding, defendants’ use fit easily into the purposes of criticism, comment, scholarship, or research, because while defendants included aspects of plaintiff’s works, defendants built on and considerably expanded upon those works. As to the nature of the work, plaintiff’s work was published, so the scope of allowable fair use was broader. As to the amount of plaintiff’s work, defendants used only minor portions of the overall work, and the labeling conventions were an insubstantial portion of that work. Finally, with respect to the effects on the market for the work, the relevant market effect is that which stems from the use of the copied expression. Although defendants’ book would compete with plaintiff’s works, the market effect of the copied portions would be minuscule.",Second Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Painting/Drawing/Graphic; Review/Commentary; Textual work,Fair use found
"Rogers v. Koons,",960 F.2d 301 (2d Cir. 1992),1992,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff photographer, Art Rogers, owned the copyright in a photograph called Puppies that defendant sculptor, Jeff Koons, used to create a sculpture, entitled String of Puppies. Defendant Koons claimed that the purpose of the resulting sculpture was to comment critically both on the original photo and the political and economic system that created it. He displayed String of Puppies at a gallery and sold copies to collectors. Plaintiff brought an action for copyright infringement, and defendant asserted that the copying was a fair use as a parody of the original. Defendant appealed the district court’s judgment that his use of the photo to create the sculpture was not a fair use.",Whether defendant’s copying of plaintiff’s photograph for the purpose of making sculptures intended as social commentary on the photograph’s image was a fair use.,"On appeal, the court affirmed that defendant was not entitled to a defense of fair use. It found that the “purpose and character” factor weighed against fair use because, while the defendant’s copying may have been a satirical critique of materialistic society in general, it “was done in bad faith, primarily for profit-making motives, and did not constitute a parody of the original work.” The court further found that defendant copied the essence of the photograph nearly in toto and exceeded a permissible level of copying under the fair use doctrine. Additionally, the court concluded that because defendant’s work was primarily commercial in nature, “the likelihood of future harm to [plaintiff’s] photograph is presumed, and [the] market for his work has been prejudiced.”",Second Circuit; Parody; Photograph; Review/Commentary; Sculpture,Fair use not found
"L.A. News Serv. v. Tullo,",973 F.2d 791 (9th Cir. 1992),1992,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiff Los Angeles News Service produced and licensed its video recordings of newsworthy events to other news media outlets. Defendant Audio Video Reporting Services recorded plaintiff’s broadcasts as part of its “news clipping” service, which involved monitoring, recording, and selling copies of segments to individuals and businesses. Defendant appealed the district court’s ruling that use of the footage was not a fair use.",Whether defendant’s copying and sale of plaintiff’s news footage as part of a video “news clipping” service constituted fair use.,"The court upheld the lower court’s determination that defendant was not protected from liability under the fair use doctrine. After rejecting defendant’s arguments that the works were not protected by copyright and that plaintiff’s enforcement was barred by the First Amendment, the court also rejected defendant’s argument that its purported purpose of “private news reporting” was fair use as a matter of law because it was among the examples of fair use provided by the statute. The court held that the examples listed in Section 107 were not intended “to single out any particular use as presumptively a ‘fair’ use,” and the fact that a work is arguably “news” is “simply one factor in a fair use analysis.” The court further found that, although the factual nature of plaintiff’s works weighed in favor of fair use, and that defendant only copied a small portion of the works, defendant nevertheless copied the most valuable parts of each work. Finally, the court found that defendant’s use could potentially adversely impact plaintiff’s market for the footage.",Ninth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; News reporting,Fair use not found
"Sega Enters. Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc.,",977 F.2d 1510 (9th Cir. 1992),1992,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiff Sega Enterprises, Inc. (Sega) manufactured video game consoles and games. Defendant Accolade, Inc., one of plaintiff’s competitors, developed its own computer games to be played on the Sega consoles. To make its game software compatible with plaintiff’s game consoles, defendant copied object code from plaintiff’s games and converted it to source code, known as “reverse engineering.” Defendant used what it learned from reverse engineering to write its own computer code to make its games compatible with Sega consoles. Defendant appealed the district court’s ruling in plaintiff’s favor.","Whether defendant’s “reverse engineering,” which involved copying, of a copyrighted computer program in order to gain an understanding of the unprotected functional elements of the program constituted fair use.","The court held that defendant’s “reverse engineering” of plaintiff’s computer program qualified as fair use, and ruled that disassembly of a copyrighted computer program for a legitimate reason and lack of other means to access the elements not protected by copyright constituted fair use. Although defendant commercially sold video games, the court found that defendant’s copying was for a legitimate, essentially non-exploitative purpose—that is deciphering the non-copyrightable functions for game console compatibility. Any commercial exploitation of the functional code was indirect and of minimal significance. Along similar lines, the court found that defendant did not usurp plaintiff’s market because defendant served as a market competitor and created its own independent, creative video games. Noting that computer programs contain a mix of creative and functional elements, the court pointed out that defendant would have been unable to access the functional, unprotected aspects without “reverse engineering” and copying. The court stressed that without a fair use exception for disassembling object code, the owner of the work would have a de facto monopoly over the functional aspects of the work.",Ninth Circuit; Computer program; Education/Scholarship/Research,Fair use found
"Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo of Am. Inc.,",975 F. 2d 832 (Fed. Cir. 1992),1992,United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,"Nintendo of America Inc., and Nintendo Co., Ltd. manufactured the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). NES was a home video game console that allowed individuals to play video game programs stored on video game cartridges. Nintendo owned the copyrights in the source and object code for a program called 10NES. The 10NES program facilitated a “lock” and “key” mechanism that allowed Nintendo to prevent its NES console from reading and playing video game programs on video game cartridges other than those that Nintendo had authorized. Because of the 10NES program, Nintendo was able to exact licensing fees from manufacturers that sought to develop video game programs capable of playing on the NES console. Nintendo’s competitors, Atari Games Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tengen, Inc., replicated the 10NES program’s object and source code, thereby making it possible to manufacture and sell video game cartridges that were compatible with the NES console without paying licensing fees to Nintendo. To replicate the 10NES object code, Atari obtained authorized copies of NES game cartridges and consoles and “reverse engineered” the object code contained in the microchips therein. Atari also gained access to an unauthorized copy of the 10NES source code by submitting false information to the U.S. Copyright Office. While in the process of “reverse engineering” the 10NES program, Atari made multiple intermediate copies of both the program’s source and object code. Atari sued Nintendo for, among other things, antitrust violations, and Nintendo sued for, among other things, copyright infringement of the 10NES program. After consolidating the two cases, the district court preliminarily enjoined Atari from exploiting Nintendo’s 10NES program.",Whether Atari’s intermediate copying of copyright protected source and object code for reverse engineering purposes qualified as fair use.,"The circuit court affirmed the district court’s imposition of a preliminary injunction, finding Nintendo demonstrated a likelihood of success on its copyright infringement claims. Regarding the 10NES source code, the court found that because Atari was not authorized to possess the copy of the source code that it obtained from the U.S. Copyright Office, any intermediate or derivative copying of the code did not qualify as a fair use. Regarding the 10NES object code, the court found that the intermediary copies of the code that Atari made while examining microchips in its “rightful possession” for the purpose of “reverse engineering” the code did not violate Nintendo’s copyright. However, the court also determined that, based on the district court’s findings that the program Atari developed as a result of its reverse engineering of the 10NES program included similarities between the programs “beyond the similarities necessary to accommodate the programming environment, or similarities necessary to embody the unprotectable idea, process, or method of the 10NES program,” Nintendo was likely to succeed on the merits of its infringement claim. Specifically the court stated that the fair use doctrine “did not give Atari more than the right to understand the 10NES program and to distinguish the protected from the unprotected elements of the 10NES program” and that “Atari could not use reverse engineering as an excuse to exploit commercially or otherwise misappropriate protected expression.”",Federal Circuit; Computer program,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
"Lish v. Harper’s Magazine Found.,",807 F. Supp. 1090 (S.D.N.Y. 1992),1992,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff Gordon Lish, a well-known writer of fiction novels and professor of an infamous creative writing class, composed a letter to forty-nine prospective students introducing them to his class. Defendant Harper’s Magazine Foundation (Harper’s), publisher of a monthly literary magazine, included an edited version of the letter in its magazine (about 48% of the original) under the title A Kind of Magnificence. Lish alleged that Harper’s infringed his copyright by publishing the letter.",Whether a scholarly magazine’s unauthorized publication of an abridged version of a letter written by a well-known author/professor who limited the letter’s distribution to prospective students qualified as fair use.,"The court held that the unauthorized publication of plaintiff’s letter did not constitute fair use. For the first fair use factor, the court found that defendant copied plaintiff’s letter without providing additional commentary, copied more than was necessary, and used it for commercial gain, all weighing against finding fair use. For the second factor, the court determined that defendant’s use of unpublished, predominantly creative material further weighed against fair use. For the third factor, the court ruled that defendant’s use of a “substantial portion” of the letter, constituting the “heart” of the work, weighed against fair use. Finally, the court concluded that the fourth factor weighed in favor of fair use because plaintiff failed to demonstrate any adverse market impact resulting from the use. The court stated that it did not believe that, even if plaintiff were to later publish a book of his writings including the letter, a potential buyer would be dissuaded from buying the book because defendant had previously published the letter.",Second Circuit; News Reporting; Review/Commentary; Textual work; Unpublished,Fair use not found
"Ass’n of Am. Med. Colls. v. Cuomo,",928 F.2d 519 (2d Cir. 1991),1991,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) brought a declaratory judgment action against defendants, New York State officials, to challenge a new state disclosure law. The new law made standardized tests, answers, and related research reports public records. Test providers were required to deposit copies with the New York State Commissioner of Education. The new state law also required test agencies to offer copies of their tests to test subjects. As owner of the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) copyright, plaintiff argued that federal copyright law preempted the new state law. Defendants appealed the district court’s ruling in plaintiff’s favor.",Whether it was fair use for a state to require owners of standardized tests to make copies of their protected research and tests publicly available without their permission.,"While generally in agreement with the district court, the appeals court held that genuine issues of fact remained as to whether the uses required under the new state law constituted fair use and remanded for further proceedings. In its fair use analysis, the court found that the purpose of the law was to advance important public interests: it was intended to promote the validity and objectivity of standardized tests, to encourage better testing instruments, and to ensure the accuracy of the scoring process. Furthermore, the state did not seek to exploit disclosed testing materials commercially, but for purposes of public scrutiny and study. Next, the court equated the tests with unpublished works based on their secure nature, thereby weighing against a finding of fair use. As to the amount of the work used under the law, the court found that the law would permit comprehensive disclosure of the test questions and answers, thereby weighing against a finding of fair use. As to whether the law would impact the market for the tests, the court found that any harm caused to the plaintiff stemmed from a non-commercial, non-competing use by the state.",Second Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Review/Commentary; Textual work; Unpublished,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
"Wright v. Warner Books, Inc.,",953 F.2d 731 (2d Cir. 1991),1991,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Defendant Margaret Walker, an author associated with the Chicago African- American literary movement, wrote an unauthorized biography of renowned author and poet Richard Wright. Defendant Warner Books, Inc. published the biography, which paraphrased and quoted from a selection of Wright’s unpublished works, such as journal entries and letters. Plaintiff Ellen Wright, Wright’s widow, appealed the district court’s judgment that Walker’s use of her deceased husband’s unpublished works was fair use.",Whether defendants’ unauthorized reproduction of excerpts and paraphrased excerpts of an author’s unpublished works in a biography about that author was fair use.,"Agreeing with the district court, the circuit court held that defendants’ unauthorized reproduction of excerpts and paraphrased excerpts from the unpublished works was fair use. To reach that conclusion, the court relied on its findings that the “analytic research” contained in defendants’ work was transformative because it “added value” to the original works. The court also found that the excerpts used were neither the “heart” of the unpublished works nor a quantitatively significant portion of the works. Finally, the court found that defendants’ work did not pose a “significant threat to the potential market” for the unpublished works.",Second Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual work; Unpublished,Fair use found

Kinko’s assembled the photocopied material into low-cost “course packets” to sell to students for a profit. Plaintiffs were a group of publishers who owned copyrights for some of the publications Kinko’s used in its course packets. Kinko’s claimed that duplicating copyrighted materials for course packets was fair use.",Whether it was fair use for Kinko’s to photocopy publishers’ copyrighted works without permission or payment for the purpose of selling course packets to students for profit.,"The court held that Kinko’s copying was not fair use. The court found that Kinko’s copied critical portions of the publishers’ works for a commercial purpose that would harm the publishers’ sales. The court also found no compelling educational reason for Kinko’s to copy the works at issue without permission or payment. The court observed that it could not sustain Kinko’s creation of a new nationwide business that usurped publishers’ copyrights and profits. At the publishers’ request, the court also evaluated the allegations under the Agreement on Guidelines for Classroom Copying in Not-For-Profit Educational Institutions (industry guidelines adopted in 1976) that specifically prohibit copying as a substitute for the purchase of books. The court determined that Kinko’s use would also be prohibited under the industry guidelines.",Second Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual work,Fair use not found

Network Prods., Inc.,",902 F.2d 829 (11th Cir. 1990),1990,United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit,"Plaintiffs Home Box Office, Inc. and Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc. alleged that defendants infringed the encryption software plaintiffs used to limit access to their cable programming. Defendants, video production company Network Productions, Inc. and its president Shaun Kenny, financed the production and distribution of decryption software that incorporated substantial portions (86%) of plaintiffs’ copyright protected software for the express and widely publicized purpose of giving non-subscription viewers access to plaintiffs’ programming. The district court ruled that defendants were liable for willful, direct and contributory infringement. Defendants appealed, asserting fair use.",Whether defendants’ use of plaintiffs’ software to create decryption software that gave non-subscribers access to plaintiffs’ cable television programming was fair use.,"The Eleventh Circuit upheld the lower court’s finding that defendants’ decryption software infringed plaintiffs’ software and was not fair use. The court held that none of the four statutory factors supported defendants’ fair use defense. In particular, the court found that the defendants’ “flagrant commercial purpose” in using virtually all (86%) of plaintiffs’ copyrighted computer program to achieve the descrambling of plaintiffs’ encrypted television signals did obvious damages to plaintiffs’ present and future markets.",Eleventh Circuit; Computer program,Fair use not found
"New Era Publ’ns Int’l, ApS v. Carol Publ’g Grp.,",904 F.2d 152 (2d Cir. 1990),1990,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff New Era Publications International, ApS (New Era) was the exclusive licensee of all Church of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard’s writings. Defendant Carol Publishing Group intended to publish an approximately 527-page manuscript titled A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics and L. Ron Hubbard Exposed (A Piece of Blue Sky), “an unfavorable biography of Hubbard and a strong attack on Scientology,” written by a former member of the Church. In both the text and at the beginning of many chapters, the author quoted widely from Hubbard’s substantial body of published works. Defendant publisher appealed the district court’s ruling that the author’s use of Hubbard’s writing was not a fair use.",Whether the unauthorized quotation of published works in a biography constitutes fair use.,"The court found that defendant’s use of Hubbard’s works was fair use. The court first found that defendant’s unfavorable biography fit comfortably within the categories of uses that could be fair –namely criticism, scholarship, and research– because A Piece of Blue Sky was designed “to educate the public about Hubbard, a public figure who sought public attention,” and used quotes to further that purpose rather than to unnecessarily appropriate Hubbard’s literary expression. The court also found that defendant’s book quoted from a small portion of plaintiff’s writings and did not take the heart of the works. Further, the quoted works were all published, which the court pointed out allows for a “greater amount of copying.” Even though plaintiff argued that defendant’s biography harmed any future biography they may authorize, the court concluded that there was not a negative effect on plaintiff’s market because potential customers for an authorized favorable biography would likely not be deterred from buying it on the basis that an unfavorable biography used the same sources. Furthermore, the court found that even if A Piece of Blue Sky’s negative critique did dissuade customers from purchasing an authorized biography, such harm “would not result from unfair infringement forbidden by the copyright laws, but rather from a convincing work that effectively criticizes Hubbard, the very type of work that the Copyright Act was designed to protect and encourage.”",Second Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Review/Commentary; Textual work,Fair use found
"Wojnarowicz v. Am. Family Ass’n,",745 F. Supp. 130 (S.D.N.Y. 1990),1990,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff Wojnarowicz was a multimedia artist focused on raising awareness about AIDs devastation in the gay community. Defendant American Family Association (AFA) was a non-profit corporation with the goal of “promoting decency” and advancing “the Judeo-Christian ethic” in American society. As part of its campaign against subsidizing offensive and blasphemous art, the AFA distributed pamphlets opposing funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. In the pamphlets, the AFA reproduced fragmented images of sexual acts that were taken from plaintiff’s art work. A slogan superimposed over them read, “Your Tax Dollars Helped Pay For These ‘Works of Art.’”",Whether unauthorized use of copyright protected images in public pamphlets to influence public policy on funding allegedly objectionable art constituted fair use.,"The court held that reproducing plaintiff’s images in the AFA pamphlet constituted fair use. The court stated that the pamphlet was entitled to great protection because public funding must remain open to challenge, and those who accept such funds must accept the right of others to protest. The court also ruled that the pamphlet’s main purpose, objecting to the federal funding, significantly outweighed its fundraising aim. Turning to the second factor, the court found the plaintiff’s works to be highly creative expressions deserving of strong protections. For the third factor, the court determined that the amount of the works used was small and weighed in favor of fair use. Finally, the court sided with defendants regarding the fourth factor and held that fair use allows “publications which criticize and comment to damage the market value of copyrighted work.” Although sales of plaintiff’s works may potentially decrease, the pamphlet did not “tap any sources of economic profit” that otherwise would have gone to authorized works.",Second Circuit; News reporting; Painting/Drawing/Graphic; Textual work,Fair use found

Abend,",495 U.S. 207 (1990),1990,Supreme Court of the United States,"At issue in this case were the rights to the 1954 film Rear Window, starring James Stewart, and the short story on which the film was based. In 1945, the short story’s author, Cornell Woolrich, assigned film rights for the first twenty-eight-year copyright term to a motion picture production company, promising to renew the copyright and assignment for the second twenty-eight- year term. But in 1968, Woolrich died before he could complete the renewal or assignment. A trust subsequently renewed the copyright in 1969 and assigned the renewal rights to plaintiff Sheldon Abend, a literary agent. In 1971, defendants Jimmy Stewart, Alfred Hitchcock, and MCA, Inc., successors in interest to Woolrich’s 1945 assignment of film rights, broadcast the film on ABC’s television network. They ignored plaintiff’s notice to stop infringing his renewal rights. Plaintiff sued defendants in 1974 and the case settled for $25,000. Years later, defendants re-released the picture through a variety of media, including movie theaters, cable TV, and film rentals and plaintiff sued again. While the district court held that defendants’ continued exploitation of the film was a fair use, the Ninth Circuit reversed and defendants petitioned to the U.S. Supreme Court.",Whether the unauthorized use of an original story to create a derivative motion picture work was fair use.,"The Court held that defendants’ exploitation of the film based on Woolrich’s original story “presents a classic example of an unfair use: a commercial use of a fictional story that adversely affects the story-owner’s adaptation rights.” Defendants’ use did not fall into any of the categories enumerated in 17 U.S.C. §107 or meet the four statutory factors. The production company made $12 million from the re-release of the motion picture, making the use commercial. Further, because the original work was fictional as opposed to factual, the use was less likely to be deemed fair. Considering the amount and significance of the use, the Court determined that the Woolrich story constituted a substantial portion of the motion picture, as the film expressly used its unique setting, plot, characters, and sequence of events. Finally, the Court found that the film’s re-release hindered the plaintiff’s ability to market new versions of the original story.",U.S. Supreme Court; Film/Audiovisual; Textual work,Fair use not found
"New Era Publ’ns Int’l, ApS v. Henry Holt & Co.,",873 F.2d 576 (2d Cir. 1989),1989,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff New Era Publications International, ApS, (New Era) alleged defendant Henry Holt & Co. infringed its license for the published and unpublished writings of Church of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. Plaintiff sought to obtain a restraining order prohibiting defendant from publishing a biography about Hubbard in the U.S. titled Bare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard. The author, who was not a party to the action, purported to contrast factual and fictional accounts of Hubbard’s life, quoting liberally and extensively from Hubbard’s published and unpublished writings, particularly unpublished early diaries and journals. The district court found that 66 of 69 quoted passages from published works and 91 of 132 passages from unpublished material were fair use. Plaintiff appealed.",Whether the district court properly denied New Era Publications an injunction preventing the publication of Bare-Faced Messiah.,"The Second Circuit upheld the denial of the injunction, but on different grounds, holding that “equitable considerations dictate denial of injunctive relief in this action.” The court also disagreed with “some of the district court’s views respecting the proper application of the four fair use factors in this case.” Since the district court found all but three passages of the published material were fair use, the appellate court restricted its comments to the 41 passages from unpublished material that the lower court ruled were not permitted by fair use. The court agreed that defendant’s use of the 41 unpublished passages was not fair use because all but one of the fair use factors favored plaintiff. The court noted that the purpose and character of the use weighed in favor of defendant because the unauthorized biography squarely fit into the purposes of criticism, scholarship, or research. But the court found that “[w]here use is made of materials of an ‘unpublished nature,’ the second fair use factor has yet to be applied in favor of an infringer, and we do not do so here.” The court agreed with the lower court that the author took a substantial amount of unpublished material, weighing against fair use. Turning to the effect on the potential market, the court held that “some impairment of the market seems likely” in light of plaintiff’s intent to commission an authorized biography that would draw upon all of Hubbard’s writings, both published and unpublished. Although the appellate court ruled in plaintiff’s favor, it invoked the doctrine of laches to deny injunctive relief to plaintiff Note: 17 U.S.C. § 107 was amended in 1992 to add the following sentence: “The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.” The court’s holding should not, therefore, be read to create a per se rule against finding fair use of an unpublished work.",Second Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Review/Commentary; Textual work; Unpublished,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
"Weissmann v. Freeman,",868 F.2d 1313 (2d Cir. 1989),1989,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff Weissmann and defendant Freeman were scientists who co-authored a number of scholarly scientific articles. Plaintiff authored an article titled Hepatobiliary Imaging, which drew significantly upon her and defendant’s co-authored works. Defendant later altered the article’s title, listed himself as the sole author and distributed fifty copies of the article to students in a medical school course that he taught. At plaintiff’s request, defendant stopped distributing copies of the article. Subsequent to this, plaintiff filed suit, requesting declaratory judgment that defendant had committed actionable infringement, an injunction, and damages. The district court found that defendant had not infringed any legally cognizable rights that plaintiff may have had in the article, because defendant was a joint author, and even were defendant not a joint author, defendant’s use was a fair use. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling on both points.","Whether defendant’s unauthorized copying and distribution of plaintiff’s scientific article, which was partially based on works they co-authored, for use as medical school course material constituted fair use.","The court held that defendant’s use of plaintiff’s article was not a fair use. Regarding the purpose and character of the use, the court found that defendant used the work for the same intrinsic purposes as plaintiff—to gain notoriety and to use in professional lectures. Regarding effect on the potential market for the work, the court determined that defendant’s planned use of the article not only undermined plaintiff’s ability to “enjoy the fruits of her labor,” but also created a disincentive for her to author and publish future articles. The court also reversed the district court’s finding that defendant was a joint author.",Second Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual work,Fair use not found
"Narell v. Freeman,",872 F.2d 907 (9th Cir. 1989),1989,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiff Irena Narell wrote Our City: The Jews of San Francisco, a biographical/historical account of Jewish immigrants in San Francisco. Defendant Cynthia Freeman admitted that she consulted plaintiff’s work for her fictional romance novel, Illusions of Love, but asserted that the copied material was not protected by copyright and that her use of the material was a fair use. The district court granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the alternative grounds that the copyright was not infringed because the works were not substantially similar, and the use of the material from Illusions was protected by fair use. Plaintiff appealed.","Whether defendant used any copyright protected material, and if so, whether using it in her novel was fair use.","The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s grant of summary judgment on both the issue of substantial similarity and the fair use defense. For the first fair use factor, the court found that defendant’s use was commercially motivated, weighing against a finding of fair use. The court then noted that plaintiff’s work was largely informational rather than creative in nature, thereby weighing slightly in defendants favor for the second factor. Since the court found that defendant’s work was not substantially similar to plaintiff’s, the court determined that the third factor, amount and substantiality of the portion used, weighed strongly in favor of fair use. Finally, the court found that defendant’s book had not, nor would it likely have, any effect on the value or marketability of plaintiff’s book.",Ninth Circuit; Textual work,Fair use found
"New Line Cinema Corp. v. Bertlesman Music Grp., Inc.,",693 F. Supp. 1517 (S.D.N.Y. 1988),1988,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiffs, New Line Cinema Corporation and affiliated organizations (New Line), owned the film rights for A Nightmare on Elm Street (Elm Street) and subsequent sequels. New Line sought to license the Elm Street characters and story for a music video based on the series, commencing negotiations with the popular rap group, the Fat Boys. Representatives for defendants Bertlesman Music Group and others contacted New Line about the possibility of using D.J. Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince instead for the song, sending a recording by the duo called A Nightmare on My Street (My Street), but negotiations between the parties ultimately failed. Later, the duo released an album which included the song My Street. New Line subsequently finalized a deal with the Fat Boys and ordered defendants to stop producing their record. Defendants subsequently produced a music video for the song that was not broadcast, after which the Fat Boys also released a licensed music video.",Whether the unauthorized use of a film’s story and character elements in a music video was fair use.,"The court ruled that defendants’ use of Elm Street in the music video My Street was not fair use. The court found that defendants’ music video existed solely as a video to promote the song, and defendants therefore stood to profit financially by using elements from plaintiffs’ films without making the usual licensing arrangements before they produced their video. Next, the court found that Elm Street was a creative work of fiction or fantasy as opposed to a factual work, which weighed against a finding of fair use. The court then found that defendants had appropriated more of plaintiffs’ copyright- protected works than was necessary for purposes of creating a purported parody, thus weighing against a finding of fair use. Finally, the court found that the My Street video, if released, would likely harm plaintiffs’ market for licensing Elm Street character and story elements in the music video market and would directly compete with the Fat Boys video.",Second Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Music; Parody/Satire; Unpublished,Fair use not found
"Salinger v. Random House, Inc.,",811 F.2d 90 (2d Cir. 1987),1987,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Defendants Ian Hamilton and Random House, Inc. collaborated to publish a biography of well-known author, plaintiff J.D. Salinger. Defendants reproduced, quoted or paraphrased several of Salinger’s unpublished letters, which their recipients had contributed to library collections. When Salinger learned that defendants used the letters, he registered them and filed a lawsuit seeking a preliminary injunction. Salinger appealed the district court’s ruling that defendants’ use of the letters was fair use.","Whether defendants’ unauthorized reproduction, quoting and paraphrasing of Salinger’s unpublished letters for use in a biography of Salinger’s life was fair use.","Reversing the lower court, the appeals court ruled that defendants’ unauthorized infringing acts were not permissible fair use. Because the letters were unpublished, the court found that a more limited scope of fair use was required, relying on Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539 (1985). Considering the nature of the works, the court ruled that being unpublished weighed strongly in Salinger’s favor. For the amount and substantiality of the portion used, the court determined that defendants’ use favored a finding against fair use because it was excessive for unpublished letters. For the effect on the marketplace, the court agreed with Salinger that paraphrasing and quoting could have a significantly adverse impact on the market for the letters, especially since defendants copied “virtually all of the most interesting passages of the letters.” Note: 17 U.S.C. § 107 was amended in 1992 to add the following sentence: “The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.”",Second Circuit; Textual work; Unpublished,Fair use not found
"Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell,",803 F.2d 1253 (2d Cir. 1986),1986,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff Katrina Maxtone-Graham published Pregnant by Mistake, a book that consisted of seventeen interviews of women who discussed their unwanted pregnancies. Defendant James Tunstead Burtchaell wrote Rachel Weeping, a book of essays that critiqued published accounts of women’s abortion experiences. After being denied permission to quote from plaintiff’s work, defendant included quotes from it in one of his essays, including 4.3% of the words in Pregnant by Mistake. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling in favor of defendant’s fair use defense.",Whether defendant’s direct quotation of plaintiff’s work for purposes of comment and criticism constituted fair use.,"The court upheld the lower court’s finding that defendant’s unauthorized direct quotation of plaintiff’s work was fair use. The court held that defendant’s criticism of and commentary on plaintiff’s work weighed strongly in favor of a finding of fair use. The court reasoned that while Pregnant by Mistake was meant to share the prochoice perspective through anecdotes, Rachel Weeping critiqued and analyzed this perspective in order to engage in the public debate on abortion. The court also found that the commercial aspects of defendant’s work were minor when compared with the work’s educational elements. The court then determined that plaintiff’s book of interviews was factual in nature and that the quantitative and qualitative amount used were minimal enough to favor a finding of fair use. Finally, the court found that there was no demonstrable harm to the market for plaintiff’s work because the two works served “fundamentally different functions, by virtue both of their opposing viewpoints and disparate editorial formats.”",Second Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Review/Commentary; Textual Work,Fair use found

MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388 (2006)",1986,United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit,"Plaintiff Education Testing Services (ETS) alleged that defendant John Katzman infringed standardized tests that ETS had developed and administered, including the Scholastic Aptitude Test and other subject-specific tests. In 1982, ETS discovered that Katzman possessed a stolen test and had distributed copies of it to students enrolled in his test preparation course, requiring ETS to cancel test results for those students who had access to the test before it was administered. The parties negotiated a settlement agreement under which Katzman promised to return all copies of the test and to refrain from copying or distributing ETS’ copyrighted or copyrightable materials. ETS alleged that in May 1985 Katzman again distributed copies of stolen ETS test materials to students in his test preparation course. Claiming fair use, defendant appealed the district court’s ruling in plaintiff’s favor.","Whether defendant’s unauthorized reproduction of a stolen copy of plaintiff’s test, and distribution of those copies for test preparation purposes, constituted fair use.","The Third Circuit held that defendant’s unauthorized copying and distribution of plaintiff’s tests did not constitute fair use. Regarding the purpose of the use, the court noted that defendant’s use was highly commercial, weighing against fair use. Concerning the nature of the copyrighted work, the court noted that the “unique nature of secure tests means that any use is destructive of ETS’s rights.” Concerning the amount and substantiality of the work used, while the court could not characterize the copying as taking “the heart” of the work, neither could it regard the copying as insubstantial. Finally, concerning the market effect, the court noted that even though defendant asserted it was not in competition with ETS, the copying rendered the materials worthless to ETS.",Third Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual work,Fair use not found
"Fisher v. Dees,",794 F.2d 432 (9th Cir. 1986),1986,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Defendant disc jockey Rick Dees wanted to use all or part of When Sunny Gets Blue, a song composed and owned by plaintiffs Marvin Fisher and Jack Segal, to create a parodic version of it. Fisher refused to give Dees permission to use the song, but Dees soon released a comedy album that contained a parody of the song—When Sonny Sniffs Glue—which contained the first six of the original song’s thirty-eight bars of music and constituted twenty-nine seconds of the approximately forty-minute album. Plaintiffs appealed the district court’s ruling that defendant’s parodic version of their song was fair use.",Whether defendant’s unauthorized use of a portion of plaintiffs’ song to create a parody constituted fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s song was a parody deserving of fair use protection. Before weighing the fair use factors, the court rejected plaintiffs’ argument that defendant’s song was not actually a parody, noting that defendant’s version was intended to “poke fun” at the original song. Further, the court found that defendant’s use of the original song after being refused permission did not demonstrate bad faith because parodists are seldom granted permission and because the parody defense exists to allow uses that generally cannot be licensed. In response to plaintiffs’ claim that immoral parodies are not protected by the fair use doctrine, the court held that, “[a]ssuming without deciding that an obscene use is not a fair use,” the parody, while innocuous or silly, was not immoral. While the use was commercial in nature, thus creating a presumption against fair use, the court noted that the presumption could be rebutted if the parody did not unfairly diminish the economic value of the original. The court held that the parody was not likely to function as a commercial substitution on the open market, as the two works did not fulfill the same consumer demand. The court also held that the parody used no more of plaintiffs’ work than was necessary to “conjure up” the original song and accomplish its parodic purpose, finding that a song is difficult to parody effectively without exact or near-exact copying since any more of a variation would have made the song unrecognizable to the general audience.",Ninth Circuit; Music; Parody/Satire; Review/Commentary,Fair use found
"Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Moral Majority, Inc.,",796 F.2d 1148 (9th Cir. 1986),1986,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiff Hustler Magazine, Inc. alleged that defendants infringed its parody of a Campari liquor advertisement, which featured fundamentalist minister Reverend Jerry Falwell. Defendants Moral Majority, Inc., a conservative political lobbying group, and Old Time Gospel House, a corporate sponsor of religious broadcasts, included slightly edited copies of Hustler’s parody with direct mailings sent out to raise funds so that Falwell could sue Hustler. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s judgment that mailing copies of the parody as part of a fundraising campaign was fair use.",Whether it was fair use for defendants to mass reproduce and distribute plaintiff’s parody advertisement as part of a campaign to raise money so that the subject of the parody could sue plaintiff.,"The court upheld the lower court’s finding that defendants’ reproduction and distribution was a fair use, despite the fact that the defendants reproduced essentially the entire work and were at least partially motivated by the commercial goal of raising funds for litigation. The court found that the character of the use—as a rebuttal of a personal attack—is similar to the two examples of fair uses given in Section 107 of the 1976 Copyright Act: criticism and comment. Additionally, the court found that there was no effect on the plaintiff’s market, as defendants’ target audience was not likely to include many readers of plaintiff’s explicit magazine.",Ninth Circuit; Painting/Drawing/Graphic; Review/Commentary; Textual work,Fair use found
"Supermarket of Homes, Inc. v. San Fernando Valley Bd. of Realtors,",786 F.2d 1400 (9th Cir. 1986),1986,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiff Supermarket of Homes, Inc., a real estate entity, sued defendant San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors, a trade association, for antitrust violations. This opinion relates to a counterclaim defendant raised for copyright infringement. After the Board refused to grant permission or issue plaintiff a license, plaintiff copied and sold to its customers as many as 672 issues of the Board’s copyright protected real estate listing books. To defend against the Board’s infringement counterclaim, plaintiff claimed fair use and argued that it distributed the books for informational purposes. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s decision that its use of the Board’s real estate listing books was not fair use.","Whether plaintiff’s copying and sale of the Board’s real estate listing books, allegedly for informational purposes, was fair use.","The circuit court affirmed the district court’s ruling that plaintiff’s use of the Board’s books was not fair use. The court found that the purely informational nature of the Board’s real estate listing books weighed in favor of fair use. However, the court relied on its determination that plaintiff’s verbatim copying of the entire works “exactly paralleled the Board’s commercial use” in finding that the copying and sale of the books was not fair use.",Ninth Circuit; Textual work,Fair use not found
"Haberman v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.,",626 F. Supp. 201 (D. Mass. 1986),1986,United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts,"Plaintiff James D. Haberman was an artist and photographer who created surrealistic fine art photograph postcards. Defendants Hustler Magazine, Inc. and Flynt Distributing Co. reproduced versions of plaintiff’s photos in Hustler magazine. For one postcard, Hustler showed substantially the entire image at one-fifth the size of the postcard or one-twentieth the size of a page, and for the other postcard, Hustler showed the entire photograph using about one- sixth of the page. Both uses were captioned with comments on the strangeness of the photographs and provided attribution to plaintiff.","Whether defendants’ unauthorized reproduction of plaintiff’s photographs in Hustler magazine constituted fair use, where Hustler included captions commenting on the strangeness of the photographs and properly attributed them.","The court found that defendants’ use of the works in their magazine was fair. In reaching its conclusion, the court found that the Hustler reproductions would “not serve as suitable substitutes for someone who wished to collect” Haberman’s works and that Hustler sought, at least in part, to provide commentary on the works. The court also determined that, to the extent that Hustler’s purpose was to comment on Haberman's works, full reproduction of them was appropriate. Finally, the court found that the works’ publication in Hustler did not materially affect their marketability for plaintiff.",First Circuit; Painting/Drawing/Graphic; Photograph; Review/Commentary,Fair use found
"Radji v. Khakbaz,",607 F. Supp. 1296 (D.D.C. 1985),1985,United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia,"Plaintiff Parviz C. Radji, as the last Ambassador to Great Britain for the government of the late Shah of Iran, kept a daily diary of his experiences that he later published as a book that he registered in both the United Kingdom and the United States. A British newspaper, the Sunday Times, paid £15,000 for the exclusive right to publish three articles containing several verbatim book passages. Without permission, defendant Javad Khakbaz, owner and editor of the Iran Times, copied 86% of the verbatim book passages, translated them into Farsi, and reprinted them for a series of articles in his paper. Plaintiff initiated an infringement action against defendants Khakbaz and Iran Times.",Whether it was fair use to publish unauthorized translations of excerpts in a newspaper that were obtained from another newspaper that was licensed to publish them.,"The court held that defendants’ unauthorized use of the Sunday Times excerpts did not constitute fair use. The court ruled that the defendants viewed the book as newsworthy and used the excerpts for their own commercial purpose—to boost sales. The court noted that the defendants were not reporting on factual news events, but were copying verbatim the expression of a political figure commenting on such events. Defendants added no new expression in the form of criticism or commentary, thereby weighing against a finding of fair use. Furthermore, defendants admitted that they were aware that plaintiff’s work was protected by copyright and used it anyway, demonstrating a lack of good faith and weighing against a finding of fair use. The court then concluded that the plaintiff’s work was an introspective and subjective account of a public figure’s experiences and not a rote recounting of biographical and historical facts. The diaries, therefore, were of the type of expression that is most protected by copyright. The court also found that the quantity and quality of the copying was substantial because defendants merely translated the contents of the excerpts contained in the Sunday Times articles—the only portions of plaintiff’s book to which they had access—into Farsi. Finally, the court found that defendants’ copying, translation, and publication of plaintiff’s work in the Iran Times adversely impacted the market and potential market for the book. The court reasoned that plaintiff’s work had been officially translated into Farsi soon after its publication, and that defendants’ publication of the Farsi excerpts would have injured the market for this translated work and may have prevented plaintiff from licensing his work to other publications. The court thus found the aggregation of these factors to be sufficiently in plaintiff’s favor.",District of Columbia Circuit; News reporting; Textual work,Fair use not found
"Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises,",471 U.S. 539 (1985),1985,Supreme Court of the United States,"Former President Gerald Ford sold plaintiff Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. the right to publish his memoirs. Time magazine paid Harper & Row for the exclusive right to serialize excerpts of the unpublished memoirs. Before Time began serializing, defendant Nation Enterprises, publisher of The Nation magazine, obtained an unauthorized copy of the unpublished memoirs and published a 2,250-word article, at least 300-400 words of which constituted verbatim quotes taken from the manuscript. Time magazine canceled its agreement with Harper & Row, who sued The Nation for infringement.",Whether The Nation’s unauthorized reproduction of excerpts from the unpublished memoirs was fair use.,"The Court found defendant’s unauthorized reproduction of excerpts from the unpublished memoirs was not fair use. The Court held that the unpublished nature of a work is a key, though not necessarily determinative, factor tending to negate a fair use defense. The Court also declined to expand fair use to create “what amounts to a public figure exception to copyright” in response to defendant’s First Amendment argument. Additionally, the Court held that although the excerpts constituted a quantitatively insubstantial portion of the memoirs, they represented “the heart of the book” and were qualitatively substantial in view of their expressive value and their key role in the infringing work. Finally, noting that the effect of the use upon the potential market for the copyrighted work was the “single most important element of fair use,” the Court found that the defendant’s use “directly competed for a share of the market” and presented “clear-cut evidence of actual damage.”",U.S. Supreme Court; News reporting; Textual work; Unpublished,Fair use not found

Defendant Carol Duncan operated TV News Clips, which made unauthorized tape recordings of news reports and sold the tapes to parties who were mentioned in the news segments. Plaintiff brought a copyright infringement action after defendant recorded and sold one of plaintiff’s news reports. Defendant appealed the district court’s ruling that copying and selling the news reports was not a fair use.",Whether defendant’s unauthorized recording and sale of a television station’s news clips to the subjects of the news reports constituted fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s unauthorized recording and sale of plaintiff’s news broadcasts did not constitute fair use. It determined that the commercial purpose and character of the use weighed heavily in plaintiff’s favor. Additionally, the court found that the nature of defendant’s use was neither productive nor creative; it merely involved the copying and selling of plaintiff’s news broadcasts without any analysis or improvement to the work. Commenting on the significance of productive and creative uses, the court explained that, while the U.S. Supreme Court in Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 (1984) did not establish being “productive” as an absolute prerequisite, the Supreme Court did recognize that the unproductive nature of a defendant’s use was a legitimate consideration that could balance the equities against fair use. In this case, the court found that defendant’s unproductive nature affected the balance against a fair use finding. The court also determined that defendant’s use adversely affected the potential market for plaintiff’s recordings since defendant’s commercial activity overlapped with plaintiff’s.",Eleventh Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; News reporting,Fair use not found
"Diamond v. Am-Law Publ’g Corp.,",745 F.2d 142 (2d Cir. 1984),1984,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"The dispute arose from a series of letters published in defendant Am-Law Publishing Corporation’s monthly magazine, The American Lawyer. Plaintiff John Diamond had a dispute with defendant (and former client) Kitty Kelley over a legal fee that Kelley refused to pay. The American Lawyer ran an August 1982 article characterizing Diamond’s efforts to collect the fee as “persistent,” and stated that Kelley had filed a grievance against Diamond with the New York state bar association. Defendant Steven Brill, editor of The American Lawyer, invited Diamond to write a letter to the magazine regarding the grievance. Diamond did so on August 5, 1982. The letter stated, among other things, “You are authorized to publish this letter but only in its entirety.” The American Lawyer subsequently published the letter in excerpted form. Diamond brought a complaint against defendants, claiming among other things that they infringed his copyright in the August 5 letter. The district court ruled that defendants’ use of the letter was legitimate news reporting protected by the fair use doctrine. Plaintiff appealed","Whether defendant’s publication of an excerpted version of plaintiff’s letter in its magazine constituted a fair use, where the magazine had previously run articles regarding plaintiff’s dispute with a former client, and where the plaintiff authorized publication of the letter only in full.","The Second Circuit held that defendant’s use of the letters constituted fair use. The court found that defendant’s editing and publication of the August 5 letter was protected as commentary and news reporting—a use expressly enumerated under Section 107 as an example of a fair use. The court also found that the work in question was informational—as opposed to being creative or fictional—and that factual works may be more freely published under Section 107 than works of a creative nature. Finally, the court noted that plaintiff conceded that present or future use of the letter had not been compromised, and that its publication in edited form did not affect its value.",Second Circuit; News reporting,Fair use found
"Fin. Info., Inc. v. Moody’s Investor Serv., Inc.,",751 F.2d 501 (2d Cir. 1984),1984,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff Financial Information, Inc. offered a subscription service called Financial Daily Called Bond Service that gave subscribers information about municipal bonds. The service included Daily Bond Cards formatted index cards about redeemable or callable municipal bonds. Defendant Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. offered a similar subscription service, Moody’s News Reports. Financial Information alleged copyright infringement when it became aware that Moody’s was copying aspects of its service. The district court ruled that Moody’s copying was fair use, as there was no evidence that Moody’s occasional use of plaintiff’s factual information adversely affected plaintiff’s sales, and Moody’s publication sometimes served the public function of giving legal notice. Plaintiff appealed.","Whether defendant’s allegedly occasional, unauthorized copying and publication of plaintiff’s financial data for a similar purpose was fair use.","The Second Circuit reversed the lower court’s finding of fair use, in light of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 (1984), decided a week after the district court’s ruling. Regarding the first fair use factor, the appellate court held that, under Sony, defendant’s use was commercial, and therefore presumptively unfair. The court indicated that it was “disinclined to place great importance on [the second] factor” and noted that the “‘non-creative’ and purely commercial” nature of the copied material did not favor either party in a fair use analysis. Regarding the third factor, the court found that defendant’s substantial, wholesale copying of plaintiff’s work favored a finding of fair use. Finally, regarding the fourth factor, the court found that although plaintiff and defendant did not offer identical products in “nose-to-nose rival sales,” defendant’s copying could have a negative commercial impact on the market for plaintiff’s works.",Second Circuit; Textual work,Fair use not found
"Brewer v.

In 1980, he agreed to commercially distribute the photo on a postcard. In 1981, defendant Hustler Magazine, Inc. reproduced a portion of the postcard in a magazine column without plaintiff’s permission. A jury found that Hustler had infringed Brewer’s copyright. Hustler appealed, claiming among other things that Hustler’s reproduction of the postcard constituted fair use.",Whether defendant’s reproduction of plaintiff’s postcard in its magazine was fair use.,"The Ninth Circuit concluded that there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could have found that Hustler’s publication of Brewer’s photo was not fair use. Regarding purpose, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the photo was “used as a humorous feature designed to enhance readership, rather than as a social commentary.” As to the nature of the work, the jury could have reasonably found that the work was a creative product, rather than an information work for which the fair use defense would have been broader. Regarding the amount of the work, Hustler cropped off only a small portion of the photo, again supporting the jury’s verdict. As to the market effect, the court looked to Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, noting that harm to Brewer could be presumed because the use was of a commercial nature. The court also observed that the jury could have found that the value of the photograph as a novelty item could have decreased due to overexposure.",Ninth Circuit; Photograph,Fair use not found
"Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,",464 U.S. 417 (1984),1984,Supreme Court of the United States,"Plaintiff-appellees, Universal City Studios and Walt Disney Productions, were producers of motion pictures and other audiovisual works for television broadcasting. They alleged that defendant-appellants, Sony Corporation and Sony Corp. of America, were contributorily liable for infringing their copyrights by manufacturing and selling Betamax home videotape recorders to home viewers for the allegedly infringing purpose of recording plaintiffs’ broadcasts.",Whether unauthorized home videotaping of television broadcasts for non- commercial “time-shifting” purposes was fair use.,"The Court ruled that noncommercial home recording of television broadcasts for the purpose of “time-shifting” was fair use. It held that, given the nature of televised works and the fact that viewers had been invited to watch the programs in their entirety free of charge, reproduction of the entire work “does not have its ordinary effect of militating against a finding of fair use.” The Court further held that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any likelihood of more than minimal harm to the potential market for, or the value of, their copyrighted works.",U.S. Supreme Court; Film/Audiovisual; Format shifting/Space shifting,Fair use found
"Consumers Union of U.S., Inc. v. Gen. Signal Corp.,",724 F.2d 1044 (2d Cir. 1983),1983,United Stated Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff Consumers Union of U.S., Inc. (CU) published Consumer Reports, a magazine that provided consumer information about products and services, including household items. CU alleged that defendants, manufacturers and sellers of vacuum sweepers, infringed by quoting a CU article in two television commercials for vacuum sweepers without plaintiff’s authorization. Both commercials disclaimed any affiliation with CU or any endorsement by CU. Defendants appealed the district court’s grant of a preliminary injunction to plaintiff.","Whether defendants’ unauthorized quotation of a Consumer Reports article in a television commercial for vacuum sweepers constituted fair use, requiring that a preliminary injunction against defendants be vacated.","The Second Circuit reversed the district court and vacated the preliminary injunction, holding that defendants’ use was a fair use. The court found that, although defendants’ use of plaintiff’s work was obviously commercial in nature, the advertisements conveyed useful information protected by the First Amendment. Further, the court found that the defendants’ purpose was to report factual information, weighing in favor of a finding of fair use. The court then determined that the informational—as opposed to creative—nature of plaintiff’s publication favored a finding of fair use. The court then noted that defendants used only twenty-nine words out of the 2,100 words contained in the relevant article, a relatively insubstantial use. Finally, regarding the market effect, the Second Circuit rejected the district court’s emphasis on the adverse impact of defendants’ use on plaintiff’s reputation as an unbiased reviewer of consumer products. The fourth factor, the court reasoned, “is aimed at the copier who attempts to usurp the demand for the original work,” and there was no convincing evidence that defendants’ commercial would substitute for back issues of Consumer Reports.",Second Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Textual work,Fair use found
"Warner Bros., Inc. v. Am. Broad. Cos., Inc.,",720 F.2d 231 (2d Cir. 1983),1983,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiffs, Warner Bros., Inc. and D.C. Comics, Inc., owned copyrights for the character “Superman” and works embodying Superman, including comic books, animated and live-action television series, and a motion picture. Defendant, ABC, Inc., created a television series called The Greatest American Hero which starred the fictional superhero “Ralph Hinkley.” Plaintiffs alleged that defendant’s Ralph Hinkley character and related promotional campaign materials infringed its Superman copyrights. Plaintiffs appealed the district court’s ruling that public confusion as to the origin of defendant’s superhero was unlikely as a matter of law.",Whether the parties’ superhero characters were sufficiently similar so that plaintiffs’ copyright claims should not be dismissed without a jury trial.,"The court found that the characters Superman and Ralph Hinkley were not so substantially similar that consideration by a jury was required. Although the fair use defense was not raised or at issue, the court briefly addressed “fragmented literal similarity,” which was the duplication of exact, or nearly exact, wording of a fragment of the protected work. The court noted that with respect to such claims, the fair use defense can be raised. The court pointed out that it can be expected that phrases and other fragments of expression contained in successful works will become part of the national language, but that does not mean that such expression loses all protection. On the other hand, although the author of a well-known copyrighted phrase “is entitled to guard against its appropriation to promote the sale of commercial products,” original works of authorship with elements of parody have a stronger fair use defense against unauthorized use. The court emphasized that “[i]t is decidedly in the interests of creativity, not piracy, to permit authors to take well-known phrases and fragments from copyrighted works and add their own contributions or commentary or humor. After all, any work of sufficient notoriety to be the object of parody has already secured for its proprietor considerable financial benefit.” This discussion did not have any bearing on the outcome of the case, but provides insight on the role of parody in a fair use analysis.

"Marcus v. Rowley,",695 F.2d 1171 (9th Cir. 1983),1983,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,Plaintiff public school teacher wrote a booklet on cake decorating that she sold to students in adult education cake decorating classes. Defendant public school teacher enrolled in plaintiff’s class and purchased the booklet. Defendant later prepared her own booklet for use in food service career classes. Defendant’s booklet used eleven pages taken verbatim from plaintiff’s work. Defendant made fifteen copies of her booklet and put them on file for her students’ use. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling that defendant’s copying for nonprofit educational purposes was fair use.,Whether defendant’s copying of another teacher’s copyrighted course material for purposes of classroom teaching on the same subject constituted fair use.,"The court concluded that defendant’s copying was not fair use. Pointing out that defendant’s nonprofit educational purpose did not automatically compel a finding of fair use, the court stated that copying a work for the same intrinsic purpose that the copyright owner intended weighs strongly against a finding of fair use. The court found that both plaintiff’s and defendant’s booklets were prepared for the identical purpose of teaching cake decorating. The court also found that, qualitatively and quantitatively, defendant’s work substantially copied the original because almost 50% of the work was a verbatim copy and that 50% contained virtually all of the substance of defendant’s booklet. Although the court did not find any effect on the potential market or measurable pecuniary damages, the other factors were enough to support a finding against fair use.",Ninth Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual work,Fair use not found
"Ass’n of Am. Med. Colls. v. Mikaelian,",571 F. Supp. 144 (E.D. Pa. 1983),1983,United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,"Plaintiff Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) owned the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) copyright. Defendant Viken Mikaelian owned and operated defendant Multiprep, Inc., which prepared students to take the MCAT by providing them with practice materials. Up to 50% of MCAT questions are used in more than one version of the test. Defendant Mikaelian personally took the MCAT eight separate times, and AAMC demonstrated that 879 of the questions in the practice materials that defendants prepared (about 90% of the practice the materials) were identical to questions on the tests administered to defendant Mikaelian. AAMC also alleged that the practice materials gave defendant’s students an unfair advantage, thus potentially harming the MCAT’s credibility. AAMC sought a preliminary injunction against plaintiff’s continued use of actual MCAT questions.",Whether the use of actual MCAT questions in preparing students to take the MCAT qualifies as fair use.,"The court granted plaintiff a preliminary injunction. It held that the MCAT questions were not merely scientific facts within the public domain, and that defendant’s use of its questions did not constitute fair use. The purpose factor did not favor defendants: Multiprep may have had a training function, but its use of the MCAT materials was highly commercial, and the materials were not assembled “to advance scientific knowledge among Philadelphia-area undergraduates.” Regarding the nature of the work, MCAT questions were created and used under strict security, and were copyrighted specifically to “prevent their use as teaching aids.” The questions were not the type of material that could be fairly used. Concerning the amount and substantiality of the work, nearly 90% of the Multiprep materials were used verbatim, making it unlikely that fair use could apply. Finally, concerning market effect, Multiprep’s use of the materials would make the MCAT questions worthless to AAMC, as continued use could “destroy the accuracy and comparability of the MCAT because Multiprep students will have an unfair advantage over others taking the MCAT.”",Third Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual work,Fair use not found
"DC Comics Inc. v. Reel Fantasy, Inc.,",696 F.2d 24 (2d Cir. 1982),1982,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff DC Comics Inc. owned copyrights for numerous comic strip characters that appear in stories with fictional characters Batman and Green Arrow. Defendant Reel Fantasy, Inc. owned a chain of stores that sold books, movie memorabilia, and comics, including Batman and Green Arrow comics. On at least two occasions, defendant used drawings of Batman and Green Arrow figures in its advertising flyers. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling in defendant’s favor.","Whether the unauthorized use of copyrighted characters in advertising flyers for a store that sold books, movie memorabilia, and comics, including comics about those characters, constituted fair use.","The court of appeals reversed the district court’s grant of summary judgment for defendants because it could not say “as a matter of law that a fair use defense will succeed.” The court pointed to several issues that brought into question defendant’s fair use defense: the advertising flyers were commercial in nature; the use was an “alleged overall appropriation of DC’s property in the Batman character;” and although defendant claimed that its flyers led to increased sales in plaintiff’s comics, plaintiff had the right to license its works and was in the best position to balance increased sales against licensing revenue. The court remanded the case back to the district court.",Second Circuit; Painting/Drawing/Graphic,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
"Roy Exp. Co. Establishment of Vaduz, Liech. v. CBS, Inc.,",672 F.2d 1095 (2d Cir. 1982),1982,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiffs Roy Export Co. and others created a thirteen-minute montage of Charlie Chaplin films for a one-time showing in Chaplin’s honor at the 1972 Academy Awards. Plaintiffs owned all rights in the Chaplin films used and refused CBS’ repeated requests for permission to use them to create its own film retrospective of Chaplin’s life. Plaintiffs thereafter created and distributed a Chaplin film biography, The Gentleman Tramp. CBS, having prepared its own “rough cut” of a biography using public domain footage of Chaplin’s films, refused to license plaintiffs’ film. When Chaplin died, CBS made a new version of his biography using plaintiffs’ Academy Awards montage, with minor editing, which it broadcast in 1977. CBS appealed the district court’s ruling in plaintiffs’ favor.","Whether a generalized First Amendment privilege barred plaintiffs’ claims of copyright infringement, common-law copyright, and unfair competition because of the right to report newsworthy events.","The court declined to recognize a First Amendment privilege in the “copyright field” that is “distinct from the accommodation embodied in the ‘fair use’ doctrine,” which resolves conflicts between First Amendment rights and copyright protection. The court acknowledged that there may be a rare work, such as the famed Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination, for which it may be arguable that both its ideas and its expression should be in the public domain because they cannot be separated. However, the court concluded that the facts in this case could not support the invention or application of even a limited First Amendment privilege.",Second Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; News reporting; Photograph,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
"Jartech, Inc. v. Clancy,",666 F.2d 403 (9th Cir. 1982),1982,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiffs were producers, distributers, and displayers of adult movies. Defendants, the Santa Ana City Council and James Clancy, directed agents to photograph and record plaintiffs’ adult films while audiences viewed them in theaters. Defendants then used the copies of five of plaintiffs’ films as evidence in nuisance abatement proceedings aimed at eliminating adult movie theaters from Santa Ana. In a subsequent infringement action, defendants both asserted a fair use defense and argued that obscene materials did not warrant copyright protection. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling in defendant’s favor on the fair use issue.",Whether the copies defendants made of plaintiffs’ films for use as evidence in nuisance abatement proceedings were protected by fair use.,"After rejecting the argument that obscene materials are not protected by copyright, the court affirmed the jury’s verdict of fair use, finding that defendants’ use of the copies was not the same intrinsic use for which the plaintiffs expected copyright protection, having been made for evidence in a nuisance abatement proceeding rather than for entertainment purposes. Further, the court found that the copies were not commercially exploitative of the copyright or of the market for plaintiffs’ films.",Ninth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Used in government proceeding,Fair use found

Supp. 113 (S.D.N.Y. 1982),1982,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Defendant Chicago Board of Trade (Board) copied plaintiff Dow Jones & Co., Inc.’s (Dow Jones) Wall Street Journal indexes. The Board put the indexes in a rulebook it distributed to members and included them with an application to the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for designation as a contract market for Portfolio Futures Contracts. Dow Jones alleged that the Board infringed its indexes by making and distributing copies.","Whether the court should grant Dow Jones’ motion for a preliminary injunction (1) to prohibit the Board from issuing copies of Dow Jones’ stock market indexes in its own rulebook or to the CFTC, and (2) to require the Board to turn over all infringing materials in its possession and obtain and turn over all of Dow Jones’ materials that it sent to its members.","The court denied the injunction because plaintiff Dow Jones did not prove that it was likely to prevail on its infringement claim. The court accepted that the indexes were copyrightable as compilations due to the subjective judgment and selectivity involved in determining which members of a given population merited inclusion in the indexes. The court, however, ruled that all four fair use criteria weighed in the Board’s favor. Focusing on the commercial impact factor, the court found there was no evidence of potential impairment of the value of the Wall Street Journal from copying the indexes and that the indexes had no value because they were never sold or licensed.",Second Circuit; Textual work,Fair use found
"Encyclopedia Brittanica Educ. Corp. v. Crooks,",542 F. Supp. 1156 (S.D.N.Y. 1982),1982,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Defendants the Board of Educational Services (BOCES) in Erie County, N.Y., and its officers and directors, operated a videotape library that included a duplication program and a film print library. BOCES did large-scale recording and reproduction of educational programs originally transmitted over public airways. It distributed the programming to educational institutions via videotape or closed circuit cable television transmissions. Plaintiffs, businesses that commercially produce and license audiovisual educational programming, alleged that BOCES infringed nineteen of their works by reproducing, distributing, and performing them.",Whether a video library’s unauthorized recording and subsequent distribution of educational programming to schools for classroom use constituted fair use.,"The court ruled that the defendants’ unauthorized recording and distribution of the protected works to schools did not constitute fair use. Although the court recognized that the purpose and character of the use was non- commercial and educational, it found that the massive scope of the copying significantly outweighed this purpose. The court also recognized the public benefit served by the dissemination of educational materials, but held that the readily available nature of the programs through traditional means warranted greater protection to the plaintiffs’ works. Furthermore, the court found that the substantial identical copying of the programs did indeed harm the market for plaintiffs’ works. The court rejected defendants’ claim that their use was fair because plaintiffs had “voluntarily licensed their copyrighted works for broadcast over the airways” where they could be “received by the public free of any costs.” In rejecting the argument, the court cited House and Senate Reports that considered similar limited actions permissible, but distinguished such actions from defendant’s “massive and systematic” copying.",Second Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Film/Audiovisual; Format shifting/Space shifting,Fair use not found
"Rubin v. Bos. Magazine Co.,",645 F.2d 80 (1st Cir. 1981),1981,United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit,"Plaintiff Issac Rubin, a college professor, wrote a dissertation entitled The Social Society of Romantic Love. The dissertation is based on a “love scale” and a “liking scale” that consist of twenty-six questions designed to determine one’s feelings about another person. Plaintiff also published his love and liking scales in an article and a book. Defendants Boston Magazine Co. and D. Herbert Lipson published plaintiff’s scales in an issue of the magazine Boston as part of an article titled How’s Your Love Life: Who Turns You On and Why? Plaintiff’s love and liking scales were set forth verbatim in a large box entitled The Test of Love. How to Tell If It’s Really Real. Defendant appealed the lower court ruling that they infringed plaintiff’s copyright.","Whether defendants’ unauthorized copying and publication of plaintiff’s “love scale” and “liking scale,” comprising twenty-six questions, in a popular magazine article about love, constituted fair use.","The court held that defendants’ publication of plaintiff’s work was not fair use. The court noted that the publication was commercial and was not for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship or research. Instead the material was used “as a quiz to entertain readers of a magazine of general circulation.” The court also noted that the material copied was an essential part of plaintiff’s work. The court further found that defendants’ use clearly affected the potential market for the work because, before the use, another publication had shown interest in licensing the scales, and it could be reasonably “inferred that after defendants’ use … other publications would be less inclined to pay the plaintiff for use of his material in a popular magazine.”",First Circuit; Textual work,Fair use not found
"MCA, Inc. v. Wilson,",677 F.2d 180 (2d Cir. 1981),1981,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Defendants produced the musical Let My People Come that appeared in cabarets and theaters and was described by critics as an “erotic nude show.” Plaintiff music publisher MCA, Inc. claimed that one of the songs in the musical, Cunnilingus Champion of Company C (Champion), was substantially similar and an infringement of its song Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy (Bugle Boy). Defendants’ song used original lyrics, but the musical compositions were similar to plaintiff’s. Defendants’ appealed the district court’s ruling in favor of plaintiff.",Whether defendants’ composition of a song with sexually explicit lyrics that was musically substantially similar to plaintiff’s song constituted fair use.,"The court held that defendants’ use was not a fair use. Focusing on whether defendants’ song was a parody, the court rejected defendants’ assertion that Champion was meant to be a humorous comment on the innocent music from the 1940s. The court noted “[w]e are not prepared to hold that a commercial composer can plagiarize a competitor’s copyrighted song, substitute dirty lyrics of his own, perform it for commercial gain, and then escape liability by calling the end result a parody or satire on the mores of society.” The court observed that to deem such use as parody and, consequently, a fair use in such situations would be an “open-ended invitation to musical plagiarism.” See also: Campbell v.

"Warner Bros., Inc. v. Am. Broad. Cos., Inc.,",654 F.2d 204 (2d Cir. 1981),1981,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiffs, Warner Bros., Inc. and D.C. Comics, Inc., owned copyrights for the character “Superman” and works embodying Superman, including comic books, animated and live-action television series, and a motion picture. Defendant, ABC, Inc. created a television series called The Greatest American Hero which starred the fictional superhero “Ralph Hinkley.” Plaintiffs alleged that defendant’s Ralph Hinkley character and related promotional campaign materials infringed its Superman copyrights. The district court refused to grant plaintiffs a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order against defendants, because it determined that plaintiffs were unlikely to prevail on the issue of whether the characters were substantially similar. The district court also indicated that defendant’s character was a parody that was protected by the fair use doctrine.",Whether defendant’s superhero character infringed plaintiffs’ copyright in the Superman character.,"The court found that the Superman and Ralph Hinkley characters were not substantially similar, therefore defendant’s character did not infringe plaintiffs’ copyrights. Although the fair use defense was not raised or at issue, the court briefly addressed the district court’s discussion of the parody defense. The court noted that while the defense may be available in “isolated instances” where a nearly identical script or an express reference to a character is made, it questioned “whether the defense could be used to shield an entire work that is substantially similar to one in competition with the copyrighted work.” Note: See also Warner Bros., Inc. v.

"Iowa State Univ. Research Found., Inc., v. Am. Broad.

Defendant ABC broadcast portions of the film without permission as part of its Olympics telecast, as well as part of subsequent telecasts. ABC asserted a fair use defense, claiming that it was engaged in disseminating the life history of an important public figure. ABC appealed the district court’s ruling that its use of the student film was not fair use.",Whether it was fair use for a broadcaster to use portions of a student film that documented an Olympic athlete’s preparations for Olympic competition for the purpose of reporting news about the athlete,"The court held that defendant’s use of plaintiff’s film did not qualify as fair use. The court noted that while the defendant had the right to use any of the uncopyrightable facts contained in plaintiff’s film, there was “no need to ‘bodily appropriate’ [plaintiff’s] ‘expression’ of that information by utilizing portions of the actual film.” The court also found that the two works at issue fulfilled the same function, thereby constricting the scope of fair use. Though only two and a half minutes of the twenty-eight minute film were used in the offending telecast, the court found that defendant used “essential” footage. The court further determined that defendant’s use of the film had significant adverse effects on the market for plaintiff’s work. Finally, the court determined that the fair use defense was unavailable to the defendant based on its conduct, as defendant copied the film while purporting to assess its value for possible purchase and repeatedly denied having ever used the film. Based on the equitable nature of the fair use doctrine, the court found that defendant’s conduct was relevant in determining the fairness of its use.",Second Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; News reporting,Fair use not found
"Triangle Publ’ns, Inc. v. Knight-Ridder Newspapers, Inc.,",626 F.2d 1171 (5th Cir. 1980),1980,United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,"Defendant-appellee Knight-Ridder Newspapers, Inc., which published the Miami Herald, published a “television booklet” providing television program listings. To promote its “television booklet,” defendant ran print advertisements displaying actual-sized reproductions of plaintiff-appellant Triangle Publications’ TV Guide, which featured the covers of certain issues of TV Guide, next to actual-sized reproductions of its own “television booklet.” Defendant also displayed plaintiff’s TV Guide in television advertisements, in a similar context. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling in defendant’s favor.",Whether defendant’s unauthorized reproduction and use of the TV Guide covers in advertisements to promote its competing product constituted fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s reproduction and use of plaintiff’s copyrighted covers was fair. While the court found that the defendant’s use of plaintiff’s works in advertisements was commercial, it also concluded that the comparative advertisement format in which the works were used was a generally accepted format within the advertising industry. The court also found that defendant did not copy the essence of plaintiff’s publications—the television schedule and articles—but only reproduced the magazine covers. Finally, the court found that the use had no effect on the potential market for, or commercial value of, the copyrighted works. The court reasoned that any effect the advertisements may have had on drawing consumers away from plaintiff’s publication resulted from the nature of advertising and not the use of the magazine covers.",Fifth Circuit; Textual work,Fair use found

The New York State Department of Commerce had used this song when it launched a 1977 advertising campaign to promote New York City. On May 20, 1978, NBC’s popular weekly comedy show Saturday Night Live used the song for a comedy sketch that depicted officials in the biblical city of Sodom attempting to recast its image in a more positive light by adopting a song based on I Love New York titled I Love Sodom.","Whether defendant’s unauthorized, allegedly satirical use of plaintiff’s advertising jingle for a comedy routine was fair use.","The court held that the defendant’s use of plaintiff’s jingle for satirical purposes was fair use. It determined that defendant’s sketch and version of the song clearly satirized the attempt to improve New York City’s tarnished image. The court noted that I Love Sodom was an upbeat tune intended to distract potential visitors’ attention from Sodom’s reputation for vice, just as I Love New York was intended to alter outsiders’ perceptions of New York City. The court then found that defendant’s use of the song did not interfere with plaintiff’s market.

Scoreboard Posters, Inc.,",600 F.2d 1184 (5th Cir. 1979),1979,United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,"Plaintiffs the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc. alleged that defendants Scoreboard Posters infringed their poster of several Cowboys cheerleaders posed in official cheerleading outfits by creating a similar poster. Defendant’s poster showed several former Cowboys cheerleaders—who formed a group called “The Texas Cowgirls”—in a nearly identical pose and wearing uniforms that were nearly identical to the Cowboys cheerleaders’ official uniform. The Texas Cowgirls’ uniforms were unbuttoned, thereby exposing their breasts. Defendants pointed to this as evidence that the poster was a parody of the original. Plaintiff sought a temporary restraining order to prevent distribution of the poster. The district court granted the order.","Whether the district court abused its discretion in determining that defendants’ unauthorized creation of a poster nearly identical to plaintiff’s, with slight modifications, did not constitute fair use.","The Fifth Circuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that defendants’ substantially similar poster did not constitute a fair use of the original. While the defendants argued that the modifications made to the poster rose to the level of a permissible parody, the court found that defendants had failed to substantiate their fair use defense with anything beyond unelaborated invocation of the term “parody.” Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction.",Fifth Circuit; Parody/Satire; Photograph,Fair use not found

Comics, Inc. owned multiple copyrights for the character of “Superman,” including a television series that was broadcast on local TV channels. Plaintiff alleged that defendant Crazy Eddie, Inc., a business engaged in selling consumer electronics, infringed its copyright by using the character in a commercial that aired on local television channels. The commercial copied “nearly every aspect” of the trailers for the television series, and simply replaced the Superman name and purpose with the defendant’s own business’ name and purpose.","Whether making an advertisement for a business that closely copied a television series trailer, replacing merely the name and purpose of the character with that of a store, constituted a fair use parody.",The court held that the defendant’s advertisement was not fair use. It concluded that the advertisement captured the “total concept and feel” of the television trailer as well as the particular idiosyncrasies of the character. It also found sufficient evidence that defendant’s commercial irreparably impaired the market value of the Superman character’s protected features for licensing purposes or otherwise.,Second Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Parody/Satire,Fair use not found

Defendants asserted that they used the graphic depictions for parody, which was a protected fair use. Defendants appealed the district court’s ruling in plaintiff’s favor.","Whether defendants’ graphic depiction of plaintiff’s cartoon characters, which defendants asserted were used for parody, was fair use.","After determining that the 1909 Copyright Act governed the proceedings, the court found that defendants copied more of plaintiff’s works than was necessary to “conjure up” the works being parodied.

"Meeropol v. Nizer,",560 F.2d 1061 (2d Cir. 1977),1977,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiffs’ parents, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were tried and executed in 1953 as Soviet Union spies. Defendants authored and published The Implosion Conspiracy, which recounted the events of the Rosenberg trial and incorporated, without authorization, verbatim portions of twenty-eight copyrighted letters written by the Rosenbergs. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief and damages for copyright infringement, defamation, and invasion of privacy. Plaintiffs appealed the district court’s ruling on summary judgment that the use was fair.","Whether the district court erred by ruling, on summary judgment, that defendant’s incorporation of verbatim portions of letters written by the Rosenbergs in a book about the Rosenberg trial was a fair use.","The court of appeals reversed the district court’s decision, finding that genuine issues of fact remained on the purpose and character of defendants’ use as well as the effect on plaintiffs’ future market. The district court had relied heavily on Rosemont Enterprises, Inc. v. Random House, Inc., 366 F.2d 303 (S.D.N.Y 1966), which held that scientific or historical works invoking the fair use doctrine should be defined broadly in favor of the historical work when determining applicability of the doctrine. The court of appeals distinguished the copying in The Implosion Conspiracy from that in Rosemont by pointing out that only two direct quotes were copied in Rosemont, while in this case there was verbatim copying of twenty-eight letters. Further, the court of appeals found that a fair use determination must analyze whether or not the copyrighted material was used “primarily for scholarly, historical reasons, or predominantly for commercial exploitation.” The court also found that the effect on the potential market was in dispute because defendants’ work could negatively impact the market for republication or the sale of motion picture rights in plaintiffs’ works.",Second Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual Work,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
"N.Y. Times Co. v. Roxbury Data Interface, Inc.,",434 F. Supp. 217 (D.N.J. 1977),1977,United States District Court for the District of New Jersey,"Plaintiffs, who are affiliated with and responsible for publishing The New York Times newspaper, annually published The New York Times Index (Index). The Index correlated data from The New York Times newspaper with citations to the pages and columns in which the data originally appeared. Defendants Roxbury Data Interface were in the process of publishing a personal name index that correlated affiliated individuals and personal names that appeared in The New York Times newspaper headings with citations to the pages on which the names appeared in plaintiffs’ the Index. Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction enjoining defendants from publishing the personal name index.",Whether defendants’ unauthorized copying of names and related data from plaintiffs’ index for use in their own publication was fair use.,"The court held that defendants’ use of data from the Index in creating its own personal name index was protected by the “fair use” doctrine. In reaching its conclusion, the court determined that, though the use was for financial gain, defendants’ work could potentially “save researchers a considerable amount of time and, thus, facilitate the public interest in the dissemination of information.” The court also found that the Index was a collection of facts rather than a creative work, and that defendants did not copy the index outright, but rather extracted names and compiled their own alphabetical index. Finally, the court determined that defendants’ personal name index would only have a “slight” impact on the market for plaintiffs’ Index.",Third Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual work,Fair use found
"H.C. Wainwright & Co. v. Wall St. Transcript Corp.,","418 F. Supp. 620 (S.D.N.Y. 1976), aff’d 558 F.2d 91 (2d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1014 (1978)",1976,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"Plaintiff H.C. Wainwright & Co., an institutional research and brokerage business, prepared detailed reports highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of various corporations and providing conclusions and predictions about the economic performance of these companies. Defendant Wall St. Transcript Corp. published a weekly economic and business newspaper, one section of which consisted mainly of abstracts of institutional research reports, including plaintiff’s. Plaintiff alleged that defendant’s publication infringed its copyright in its financial research reports.",Whether defendant’s unauthorized preparation and publication of abstracts of plaintiff’s reports constituted fair use.,"The court held that defendant’s unauthorized use of plaintiff’s works did not constitute fair use. The court noted that, while “news”—as the defendant described the reports—is not copyrightable, the original expression of the facts is protected. The court found that defendant did not distinguish between the facts contained in the reports and plaintiff’s expression of those facts or add any independent analysis or research to the plaintiff’s reports. Instead, defendant appropriated the most creative and original aspects of the reports— the financial analyses and predictions. The court also found that defendant’s use of plaintiff’s reports had the potential to “materially reduce” demand for the originals.",Second Circuit; News reporting; Textual work,Fair use not found
"Williams & Wilkins Co. v. United States,",487 F.2d 1345 (Ct. Cl. 1973),1973,United States Court of Claims,"Plaintiff Williams & Wilkins Co. was a major publisher of medical journals and books. Defendants National Institutes of Health and National Library of Medicine would, upon request, photocopy articles in medical journals published by plaintiff and distribute them to researchers. Defendants did not monitor the reason for the copy requests, and the requesting researcher could retain the copy permanently. Plaintiff sued for copyright infringement, and defendants raised the fair use defense.",Whether the defendants’ unauthorized photocopying of plaintiff’s articles for use by medical researchers constituted fair use.,"The court held that defendants’ unauthorized photocopying of plaintiff’s articles was fair use because the copies were made for the researchers’ own professional use and not for profit or other gain. Defendants also placed strict limitations on photocopying, which kept “the duplication within appropriate confines.” The court based its fair use decision on three main determinations. First, the court noted that plaintiff did not prove that it had been or would be harmed substantially by defendants’ practices. Second, the court was convinced that holding defendants’ practices to be copyright infringement would “no doubt” harm medicine and medical research. Third, the court held that balancing the interests of science with those of publishers required a legislative solution.",Federal Circuit; Education/Research/Scholarship; Textual work,Fair use found
"Rosemont Enters., Inc. v. Random House, Inc.,",366 F.2d 303 (2d Cir. 1966),1966,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiff Rosemont Enterprises, Inc. was organized in 1965 by Howard Hughes, who is known for pioneering work in aviation and motion pictures. Plaintiff owned the copyright in a series of articles entitled The Howard Hughes Story that appeared in three issues of Look Magazine in early 1954. Defendants John Keats and Random House wrote and published the 1966 book Howard Hughes – a Biography by John Keats, which copied portions of plaintiff’s articles. Defendants appealed the district court ruling, in the course of granting a preliminary injunction, that they were likely not protected by the fair use doctrine because a work published for commercial purposes that was designed for the popular market precluded a fair use finding regardless of the nature of the work involved.",Whether defendants’ unauthorized reproduction of plaintiff’s articles for use in a biography constituted fair use.,The court reversed the district court’s preliminary injunction and found that defendants’ claim of fair use was warranted. The court determined that the district court erred by unjustifiably restricting the fair use defense to scholarly works written and prepared for scholarly audiences. The court noted that “the arts and sciences should be defined in their broadest terms” and include biographies like defendants’. The court also stated that the district court relied too heavily on the work’s commercial aspect when a commercial motive or popular style of writing should be irrelevant to the determination of whether a work offers a public benefit.,Second Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual work,"Preliminary ruling, mixed result, or remand"
"Berlin v. E.C. Publ’ns, Inc.,",329 F.2d 541 (2d Cir. 1964),1964,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,"Plaintiffs, popular songwriters including Irving Berlin, alleged that defendants, publishers, employees, and distributors of Mad Magazine, infringed the copyrights in twenty-five of their popular songs by publishing satirical parody lyrics to those songs. As evidence, they pointed to the satirical songs’ titles, meters and occasional phrases taken from the plaintiffs’ original lyrics. Defendants invoked the fair use doctrine. The district court ruled in favor of defendants regarding twenty-three of the twenty-five songs. Plaintiffs appealed.","Whether defendants’ satires and parodies of plaintiffs’ songs, which were limited to copying brief phrases without reproducing any of the copyrighted musical compositions, constituted fair use.","The court held that defendants’ parodies of plaintiffs’ songs were not infringing. Noting that the extent to which a parodist may borrow from the original work is unsettled, the court’s analysis focused on the “substantiality” test —the quantitative and qualitative amount taken from plaintiffs’ songs. According to the court, a parodist must be allowed to take as much as necessary to “recall or conjure up” the original. Defendants’ use satisfied this test because disparities in theme, content, and style between the original lyrics and the parodies were extensive. Brief phrases taken from plaintiffs’ songs were not greater than necessary to recall or conjure up the originals. Furthermore, the court held that the parodies clearly were not intended to fulfill demand for the originals, nor did they have such effect.",Second Circuit; Music; Parody/Satire,Fair use found
"Wihtol v. Crow,",309 F.2d 777 (8th Cir. 1962),1962,United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,"Plaintiff Austris A. Wihtol owned the copyright for the musical composition My God and I. Plaintiff alleged that defendant-appellee Nelson Crow infringed My God and I by making and distributing an unauthorized arrangement of the work. As part of its ruling, the district court found that defendant’s reproduction of the work was “fair use” because he did not intend to commit copyright infringement. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling.",Whether a lack of intent to commit copyright infringement supports a finding of fair use.,"In reversing the district court, the circuit court held that “innocent intent” has no bearing on a fair use analysis. Specifically, the court stated: “[w]hatever may be the breadth of the doctrine of ‘fair use,’ it is not conceivable to us that the copying of all, or substantially all, of a copyrighted song can be held to be a ‘fair use’ merely because the infringer had no intent to infringe.”",Eighth Circuit; Music,Fair use not found
"Eisenschiml v. Fawcett Publ’n, Inc.,",246 F.2d 598 (7th Cir. 1957),1957,United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,"Plaintiff was a civil war historian who authored several books about Lincoln’s assassination. He alleged that defendant Fawcett Publication, Inc. infringed his copyright by printing Joseph John Millard’s article about President Lincoln’s assassination, America’s Greatest Unsolved Mystery, in True magazine. Plaintiff asserted that Millard copied two of his books, Why Was Lincoln Murdered? and In the Shadow of Lincoln’s Death. Millard, a freelance writer, regularly consulted plaintiff’s books for articles on Lincoln. The district court found that defendant’s use of plaintiff’s works was not actionable “because it was an insignificant use, a fair use or use of non- copyrightable material.” Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling in defendant’s favor.","Whether defendant’s use of content from plaintiff’s copyrighted books in writing an article on the same topic constituted fair use, where defendant did not literally copy that content.","The Seventh Circuit upheld the lower court’s finding that “such use as [defendant] Millard did make of plaintiff’s books was a fair use,” finding that in “historical writings such as the events immediately before and after President Lincoln’s assassination, plaintiff and [defendant] Millard were necessarily, [sic] writing about the same personages during a very limited period of time. It is to be expected that there would result some similarity of treatment.”",Seventh Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual work,Fair use found
"Benny v. Loew's, Inc.,","239 F.2d 532 (9th Cir. 1956), aff’d by an equally divided court, 356 U.S. 43 (1958)",1958,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,"Plaintiffs were the theater chain Lowe’s, Inc. (at that time, parent company of Metro-Goldwyn-Myer Studios) and an English author, Patrick Hamilton, who wrote the 1938 play Gas Light. In 1942, Hamilton gave Loew’s the exclusive film rights for Gas Light, which film director Alfred Hitchcock adapted into a popular movie of the same name. In 1952, without plaintiffs’ permission, defendant CBS, Inc. broadcast Autolight, a burlesque of Hitchcock’s Gas Light, starring comedian Jack Benny, also a defendant. Defendants asserted that the burlesque was a fair use. Observing that this was a case of first impression, the district court held that defendants’ use of substantial portions of plaintiffs’ work to create a burlesque was not fair use. Defendants appealed.","Whether using substantial portions of an underlying work, such as a movie, to create a burlesque version is fair use.","The circuit court upheld the lower court’s finding that the defendants’ burlesque version of Gas Light infringed plaintiffs’ copyright and was not a fair use. In particular, the court noted that the doctrine of fair use was not applicable to copying for the purpose of creating a burlesque. In rejecting the defendants’ fair use argument, the court rejected defendants’ assertion that their version of Gas Light was a parody and found that a “burlesque presentation of [a work] is no defense to an action for infringement of copyright.” Note: This holding was invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 (1994).",Ninth Circuit; Film/Audiovisual; Parody/Satire; Textual work,Fair use not found
"Toksvig v. Bruce Pub. Co.,",181 F.2d 664 (7th Cir. 1950),1950,United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,"Plaintiff Signe Toksvig authored a biography of Hans Christian Andersen entitled The Life of Hans Christian Andersen (1934). In authoring the biography, plaintiff conducted three years’ worth of original research from exclusively Danish sources, including primary sources such as Andersen’s letters and interviews with Andersen’s contemporaries. Margaret Hubbard authored a novel based on the life of Hans Christian Andersen entitled Flight of the Swan (1946). In the year it took Hubbard to author her novel, she consulted only English sources, including plaintiff’s biography. Plaintiff alleged that Hubbard’s novel copied certain passages from the biography and initiated an infringement action against defendant Bruce Publishing Co., the company that published Hubbard’s novel. Defendant appealed the district court’s ruling that Hubbard’s novel infringed plaintiff’s copyright in the biography by copying twenty-four specific passages of translation from the work.",Whether defendant’s copying of twenty-four passages of translation from plaintiff’s work was fair use.,"The Seventh Circuit affirmed the lower court’s ruling that defendant’s copying was not a fair use. The court rejected defendant’s argument that the information taken from the biography was factual, finding that defendant’s use of plaintiff’s translated passages saved her considerable time, allowing defendant to complete her novel much more quickly than if she had done the research herself.",Seventh Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual work,Fair use not found
"Folsom v. Marsh,",9 F. Cas. 342 (C.C.D. Mass. 1841),1841,United States Circuit Court for the District of Massachusetts,"Plaintiff Jared Sparks, who owned copyrights in President Washington’s personal and official papers that he edited for The Writings of George Washington, published a twelve-volume work including President Washington’s papers with plaintiff publisher Folsom, Wells and Thurston. Defendant Reverend Charles Upham, a writer and anthologist, copied 353 pages of President Washington’s papers in the two-volume work The Life of Washington in the Form of an Autobiography, published by defendant Marsh, Capen and Lyon. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants infringed their copyrights because Upham copied the papers verbatim from Spark’s book.",Whether defendant’s verbatim use of the protected letters constituted an “act of piracy” under the 1841 copyright law.,"The court found that defendant’s use of plaintiff’s letters was not fair use. In reaching this conclusion, the court recognized principles that are the foundations for the modern fair use doctrine, stating: “In short, we must often, in deciding questions of this sort, look to the nature and objects of the selections made, the quantity and value of the materials used, and the degree in which the use may prejudice the sale, or diminish the profits, or supersede the objects, of the original work.”",First Circuit; Education/Scholarship/Research; Textual work,Fair use not found
