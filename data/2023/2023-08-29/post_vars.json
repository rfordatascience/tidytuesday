  "pic1_alt": "The copyright C symbol with mouse ears and an infinity symbol bow-tie, all in a red circle with a line through it. The image is intended to look similar to Disney's Mickey Mouse character, and to parody their famous litiginous nature. The image comes from the Howard Community College Library page about fair use (https://howardcc.libguides.com/fairuse-copy) and is used without permission for educational purposes.",
  "pic2_alt": "A photo of a pan scale on a desk in front of some books. The photo comes from the U.S. Copyright Office Fair Use Index (https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/), where it is not attributed. It is unclear whether the U.S. Copyright Office owns the rights to the photo, the photo is in the public domain, or it is intended to be an example of a educational fair use (even though it is not directly related to their article). In our context it *is* intended educationally to demonstrate that even the U.S. Copyright Office is sometimes unclear about attribution."
