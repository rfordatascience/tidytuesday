  "pic1_alt": "Layout of the experimental plots and sampling locations. A: Location of all 24 plots (numbered and outlined in white). Blue flag marks the weather station location. A fence to exclude cattle surrounds the entire site (blue line). The outline for plot 24 also shows how, from 1995 to 2016, the northeast corner of plot 24 was cut off, excluding 2 rodent stakes and one plant quadrat. B: Permanent rodent trapping locations (‘stakes’, purple diamonds) shown for plot 2. C: Permanent plant sampling locations. Quadrats for counting abundance (blue triangles) are interlaced with the rodent trapping locations (purple diamonds). Transects for assessing perennial cover (yellow lines) span the plot diagonally from corner to corner (yellow circles).",
  "pic2_alt": "Rodent treatment assignments on plots (y-axis) over time (x-axis). All plots were controls during an initial burn-in period, before treatments were applied. Long-term plots (those which have not had their treatments altered since the original assignment) are labeled in bold and underlined. They are plots 3, 4, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 23. Plots have large gates to allow access to all rodents (“control”), medium gates to allow access to all rodents but the largest species of kangaroo rat, the Banner-tailed kangaroo rat (“D. spectabilis exclosure”), small gates to exclude all species of Dipodomys (the dominant genus) but allow access to all other rodents (“k-rat exclosure”), or no gates to exclude all species of rodent (“total rodent exclosure;” any rodents trapped on these plots are removed from the site)."
