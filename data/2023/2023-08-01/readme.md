# US State Names 

Happy [Colorado Day](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/colorado-day)! The data this week comes from three Wikipedia articles: [List of states and territories of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States), [List of demonyms for US states and territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_demonyms_for_US_states_and_territories), and [List of state and territory name etymologies of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_state_and_territory_name_etymologies_of_the_United_States).

A number of past TidyTuesdays (such as 
[2018/2018-04-03](https://tidytues.day/2018/2018-04-03), [2019/2019-01-29](https://tidytues.day/2019/2019-01-29), [2020/2020-03-10](https://tidytues.day/2020/2020-03-10), and [2022/2022-11-08](https://tidytues.day/2022/2022-11-08) have state columns. Might joining in this state date offer any insights to those datasets?

## The Data

```{r}
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-08-01')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2023, week = 31)

states <- tuesdata$states
state_name_etymology <- tuesdata$state_name_etymology

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

states <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2023/2023-08-01/states.csv')
state_name_etymology <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2023/2023-08-01/state_name_etymology.csv')
```

## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
