# R Package Structure

Happy Boxing Day!
While you're dealing with your physical packages, we're looking into R packages!

The dataset this week comes from ["Historical Trends in R Package Structure and Interdependency on CRAN"](https://mpadge.github.io/pkgstats-analyses/articles/pkgstats.html) by Mark Padgham and Noam Ross.
In that paper, they use the [{pkgstats}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pkgstats) R package to analyze the structure of R packages over time, using an archive of all packages on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) as of 2022-11-22.
We've provided csv versions of two of [the datasets from that paper](https://zenodo.org/records/7414296).

The paper focuses on package characteristics over time.
It might be interesting to look at the distribution of similar features (such as lines of code) across packages.

If you're unfamiliar with some of the terminology in this dataset, you might find the [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) book by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan helpful.

## The Data


```{r}
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-12-26')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2023, week = 52)

cran_20221122 <- tuesdata$cran_20221122
external_calls <- tuesdata$external_calls
internal_calls <- tuesdata$internal_calls

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

cran_20221122 <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-12-26/cran_20221122.csv')
external_calls <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-12-26/external_calls.csv')
internal_calls <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-12-26/internal_calls.csv')
```

If you would like to dive deeper, you can download the larger dataset with this code:

```{r}
cran_all_20221122 <- readr::read_rds("https://zenodo.org/records/7414296/files/pkgstats-CRAN-all.Rds?download=1")
```

## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.

### Cleaning Script

The authors provided mostly [clean data](https://zenodo.org/records/7414296.
We chose one of their datasets, lightly cleaned the data, and saved it as a CSV.
We also split the `external_calls` data into two files, one for calls to functions in other files in the same package (`internal_calls.csv`) and one for calls to functions in other packages (`external_calls.csv`).

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(fs)

working_dir <- here::here("data", "2023", "2023-12-26")

cran_20221122_url <- "https://zenodo.org/records/7414296/files/pkgstats-CRAN-current.Rds?download=1"
cran_20221122 <- readr::read_rds(cran_20221122_url) |>
  dplyr::ungroup() |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    dplyr::across(
      c(translations, depends:linking_to, languages, external_calls),
      \(x) {
        dplyr::na_if(x, "NA") |> 
          dplyr::na_if("")
      }
    )
  )
dplyr::glimpse(cran_20221122)


calls_20221122 <- cran_20221122 |>
  dplyr::select(package_from = package, external_calls) |>
  tidyr::separate_longer_delim(
    external_calls,
    ","
  ) |>
  # In at least one case, an extra "L:" prefix was picked up from a 1:10-style
  # range.
  dplyr::mutate(
    external_calls = stringr::str_remove(external_calls, "^L:")
  ) |> 
  tidyr::separate_wider_delim(
    external_calls,
    ":",
    names = c("package_to", "n_total", "n_unique")
  )

cran_20221122$external_calls <- NULL

external_calls <- calls_20221122 |> 
  dplyr::filter(package_from != package_to)
internal_calls <- calls_20221122 |> 
  dplyr::filter(package_from == package_to) |> 
  dplyr::select(package = package_from, n_total, n_unique)
