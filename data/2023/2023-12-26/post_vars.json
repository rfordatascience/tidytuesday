The y-axis shows curves for the number of contributors, and separate curves for the number of authors. Contributors weren't acknowledged until 2010, and have risen steadily since, both for new packages and for existing packages. The number of authors per package has risen slightly from about 1.6 authors per package in 1998, down to about 1.5 in about 2002 to 2003, and then slowly up to about 2 authors per package. When including packages that weren't updated in a given year, the number of authors per package has increased even more, to about 2.2 authors per package.",
  "pic2_alt": "A plot of lines of code in packages over time. The x-axis shows the year, from 1998 through 2022. The y-axis shows the number of lines of code per package, ranging from 0 to about 4000. Separate curves are shown for each of the source directories: R, inst, src, and then a separate curve for the total between R and src. Lines of code in the R and src directories increased between 2000 and 2005, decreased until about 2016, and have increased slightly since then. The inst directory began to be used in about 2006, was very highly used in about 2014, and has decreased to just above 1000 lines."
