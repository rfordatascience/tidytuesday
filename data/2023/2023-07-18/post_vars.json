  "pic1_alt": "Line plot of global mean temperature per month. Peak temperatures are in July and lowest temperatures are in December and January. Global average temperatures have increased approximately 2 degrees since the 1880s. Derived from the MERRA2 reanalysis over 1980-2015. We show how much warmer each month of the GISTEMP data is than the annual global mean. Graph data: The 1980-2015 seasonal cycle anomaly in MERRA2 along with the 95% uncertainties on the estimate of the mean.",
  "pic2_alt": "Global map showing temperature differences in 2023 compared with the time period 1951-1980. Most areas of the map indicate that temperatures are 1 to 2 degrees warmer. Areas of northern Canada, northern Russia and Antarctica are up to 6.5 degees warmer. Some areas over oceans are the same or slightly cooler. An estimate for the global mean of the calculated field is 0.94 degrees."
