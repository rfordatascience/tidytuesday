  "pic1_alt": "An example map labeled 'Explore Distribution Trends: Field Sparrow. Percent Feeders Visited of total FeederWatch locations'. The map shows the United States and Canada, divided into 6 regions. Each region is a different color, and has a percentage label. The label also has a circle indicating how large the value is. The northernmost region is purple, with 0%. The northwest region is blue, also 0%. The southwest region is pink, 0%. The central region is green, 3.8%. The southeast region is red, 8%. The northeast region is orange, 4.1%.",
  "pic2_alt": "An example plot labeled 'Explore Distribution Trends: Field Sparrow. Percent Feeders Visited' and then a second plot labeled 'Average Flock Size'. The top plot has year from 1990 to 2022 on the x-axis, and percentag from 0% to 16% on the y-axis. There is a red line starting at about 16% in 1990 and decreasing slightly, ending at about 10% in 2022. Below that are orange and green lines that both begin at about 5% in 1990, and stay roughly constant, ending round 3 to 5% each. The bottom plot has the same years as the top plot, but the y-axis is integers from 0 to 6. A red line, a green, line, and an orange line each begin between 3 and 4 in 1990, and then vary between 1 and about 7 over the years. A light blue line appears in 2016 with a poit at about 5, but is 0 for all other years."
