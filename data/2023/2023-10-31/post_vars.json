The y-axis lists authors, each with a bar representing the proportion of their ratings that were tagged false or false-like, a mixture, or true or true-like. David Emery, Dan Evon, and Brooke Binkowski only found claims to be false. Madison Dapcevich, Jordan Liles, and Dan MacGuill only found claims to be true. Alex Kasprak found claims to be a mixure of true and false. The other authors had a mixture of the three ratings."
