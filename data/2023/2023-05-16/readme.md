### Please add alt text to your posts

Please add alt text (alternative text) to all of your posted graphics
for `#TidyTuesday`.

Twitter provides
[guidelines](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/picture-descriptions)
for how to add alt text to your images.

The DataViz Society/Nightingale by way of Amy Cesal has an
[article](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81)
on writing *good* alt text for plots/graphs.

> Here's a simple formula for writing alt text for data visualization:
> \### Chart type It's helpful for people with partial sight to know
> what chart type it is and gives context for understanding the rest of
> the visual. Example: Line graph \### Type of data What data is
> included in the chart? The x and y axis labels may help you figure
> this out. Example: number of bananas sold per day in the last year
> \### Reason for including the chart Think about why you're including
> this visual. What does it show that's meaningful. There should be a
> point to every visual and you should tell people what to look for.
> Example: the winter months have more banana sales \### Link to data or
> source Don't include this in your alt text, but it should be included
> somewhere in the surrounding text. People should be able to click on a
> link to view the source data or dig further into the visual. This
> provides transparency about your source and lets people explore the
> data. Example: Data from the USDA

Penn State has an
[article](https://accessibility.psu.edu/images/charts/) on writing alt
text descriptions for charts and tables.

> Charts, graphs and maps use visuals to convey complex images to users.
> But since they are images, these media provide serious accessibility
> issues to colorblind users and users of screen readers. See the
> [examples on this page](https://accessibility.psu.edu/images/charts/)
> for details on how to make charts more accessible.

The `{rtweet}` package includes the [ability to post
tweets](https://docs.ropensci.org/rtweet/reference/post_tweet.html) with
alt text programatically.

Need a **reminder**? There are
[extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitter-required-alt-text/fpjlpckbikddocimpfcgaldjghimjiik/related)
that force you to remember to add Alt Text to Tweets with media.

# Tornados

The data this week comes from NOAA's National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center [Severe Weather Maps, Graphics, and Data Page](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/#data).
Thank you to [Evan Gower](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues/549) for the suggestion!

Evan [investigated](https://www.kaggle.com/code/evangower/diving-into-us-tornado-data) a version of this dataset on Kaggle.

### Get the data here

```{r}
# Get the Data

# Read in with tidytuesdayR package 
# Install from CRAN via: install.packages("tidytuesdayR")
# This loads the readme and all the datasets for the week of interest

# Either ISO-8601 date or year/week works!

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-05-16')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2023, week = 20)

tornados <- tornados

# Or read in the data manually

tornados <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2023/2023-05-16/tornados.csv')
```

|yr           |integer   |Year, 1950-2022. |
|mo           |integer   |Month, 1-12.|
|dy           |integer   |Day of the month, 1-31. |
|date         |date      |Date. |
|time         |time      |Time. |
|tz           |character |[Canonical tz database timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).|
|datetime_utc |datetime  |Date and time normalized to UTC. |
|st           |character |Two-letter postal abbreviation for the state (DC = Washington, DC; PR = Puerto Rico; VI = Virgin Islands). |
|stf          |integer   |State FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) number. |
|mag          |integer   |Magnitude on the F scale (EF beginning in 2007). Some of these values are estimated (see fc). |
|inj          |integer   |Number of injuries. When summing for state totals, use sn == 1 (see below). |
|fat          |integer   |Number of fatalities. When summing for state totals, use sn == 1 (see below). |
|loss         |double    |Estimated property loss information in dollars. Prior to 1996, values were grouped into ranges. The reported number for such years is the maximum of its range. |
|slat         |double    |Starting latitude in decimal degrees. |
|slon         |double    |Starting longitude in decimal degrees. |
|elat         |double    |Ending latitude in decimal degrees. |
|elon         |double    |Ending longitude in decimal degrees. |
|len          |double    |Length in miles. |
|wid          |double    |Width in yards. |
|ns           |integer   |Number of states affected by this tornado. 1, 2, or 3. |
|sn           |integer   |State number for this row. 1 means the row contains the entire track information for this state, 0 means there is at least one more entry for this state for this tornado (om + yr). |
|f1           |integer   |FIPS code for the 1st county. |
|f2           |integer   |FIPS code for the 2nd county. |
|f3           |integer   |FIPS code for the 3rd county. |
|f4           |integer   |FIPS code for the 4th county. |
|fc           |logical   |Was the mag column estimated? |
