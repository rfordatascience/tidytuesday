1,This chapter chronicles the period from the formation of the 40-Eridani system to the beginnings of life on the planet Vulcan about two billion years ago.

Assuming Surak's death was not long after the Sundering, the Awakening occurred between 254 and 339 AD.

39,The given year of 2231 was changed to match The Star Trek Chronology.
40,"Takes place six years after Part One. Spock's age is eight. The story mentions that twenty-two years have passed since ""first contact"" between the Klingons and the Federation, which is very close to The Star Trek Chronology's date of 2218, though this assumption was supplanted by Star Trek: Enterprise."
41,Takes place four years after Part Two. References which claim that ninety years have passed since the incorporation of the U.F.P. have been ignored.
42,"The story's date of 2242 for the battle at Donatu 5 was based upon an error in the first edition of The Star Trek Chronology.The battle actually takes place 23 years prior to ""The Trouble with Tribbles,"" so we have adjusted the year accordingly."

57,"Said to be eighteen years prior to the main story, but is actually twenty-one years."

59,The time lapse of seventy-four years was changed to one hundred.
60,"Kirk is a lieutenant commander, set eighteen years before the rest of the story. This allows him to be a lieutenant during the events on the Farragut as established in ""Obsession"" (TOS), and then be promoted after that."
61,"This scene features Kirk with his infant son. However, other stories claim Kirk was unaware of David's birth at this time. As a dream sequence, this may be historically unreliable."
62,"The story claims Kirk took command of the Enterprise shortly after his thirtieth birthday, but this contradicts The Star Trek Chronology. Chekov has low watch on the bridge but is assumed to still be an Academy student. Sulu is a recent ""graduate,"" presumed to be some sort of advanced degree."

66,"Occurs during ""Where No Man Has Gone Before."""
67,"This novel describes the changes to crew postings which set up the main body of stories in the obligatory ""five-year mission,"" though some of the changes contradict Enterprise: The First Adventure. The Star Trek Chronology placed the five-year mission in the period from 2264-69, but this assumption was supplanted by ""Q2"" (VOY) which fixes the end of the mission in 2270. Note that the episode ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" (TOS) does not include an opening monologue describing a five-year mission."

102,"Story continues several weeks past ""The Mark of Gideon"" (TOS)."
103,"Placement represents a compromise between the Historian's Note, which puts the story about halfway through Kirk's first five-year mission, and David's age, which is supposed to be ten. We assume that the planet ""Alpha Maluria Seven"" is not part of the system destroyed in ""The Changeling"" (TOS)."

118,Christine Chapel begins pursuit of her doctorate.
119,"Prior to the publication of The Star Trek Chronology, many circles within fandom believed that Kirk commanded a second five-year mission prior to Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Stories set in this period typically featured promotions for the bridge crew, the return of Janice Rand, the movie-era uniforms, upgrades to the Enterprise, and so on. Black Fire marks the transition point to this era, the scope of which we have greatly reduced to fit within the final six months of the five-year mission. Reconciling the time constraints is left to the reader."
120,"Story is set years after ""Devil in the Dark"" (TOS). Kirk is said to be in his forties yet the crew ranks and uniforms are from the pre-TMP era. Chekov is temporarily in charge of security."

129,This timeline is eliminated at the end of the story.
130,"The bulk of The Lost Years takes place in early 2271 (The Star Trek Chronology has Spock returning to Vulcan to undergo Kohlinar in 2270). Spock's age is established to be forty-one, but Kirk's age thirty-six is incorrect. References to Tomson having served with Kirk for four years and the season being autumn are problematic."
131,"Story is set ""shortly after the end of the Enterprise's five-year mission, immediately following the events chronicled in The Lost Years."" This occurs after Spock decides to pursue Kohlinar, contradicting the December 2269 date."
132,"The 2270 date in the novel has been adjusted to 2272, following the first two Lost Years novels."
133,"Story is set ""shortly before the events chronicled in Star Trek: The Motion Picture."" Since dates placing this novel during the Apollo 11 tricentenial contradict The Star Trek Chronology, we assumed the story to be centered around the tricentennial of the Apollo space program (1969-1972) instead."
134,"Story is set weeks before Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Several references to Kirk having been Chief of Operations for approximately a year, suggest a late 2272 time period for this novel, some four months after A Flag Full of Stars (TOS #54)."

139,"Story is set after ""More Troubles, More Tribbles"" (TAS) and ""some years"" after ""Day of the Dove"" (TOS).

141,Story is set shortly after Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
142,Story is set shortly after Star Trek: The Motion Picture.

144,"Takes place in the weeks leading up to the lunar (Asian) new year, thirty years after the Battle of Donatu V."
145,Chapter 2 establishes that Uhura and Chekov had known each other for eight years. Chapter 3 establishes that Uhura had been in Starfleet for twelve years.
146,"The severe damage incurred by the USS Kongo demands placement after Shell Game (TOS), which also features the ship. Kirk's age is said to be ""just over forty"" (i.e., perhaps forty-one)."

149,"Story is set immediately after The Wounded Sky and one ""standard year"" prior to The Romulan Way. Note that the setting originally intended for Duane's novels was a purported second five-year mission prior to Star Trek: The Motion Picture-an idea since discarded.

175,"The ""planetary"" years on Ceti Alpha 5 are roughly equivalent to 1.2 Earth years."

188,Story is set just before the TOS-era portion of Star Trek: Generations.
