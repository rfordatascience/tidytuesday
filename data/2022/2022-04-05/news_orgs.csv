Public service journalism has always been our goal, and last year - as measles outbreaks were popping up around the country for the first time in 25 years - we pushed the Connecticut Department of Public Health into releasing school-level vaccination data for the first time by highlighting the law preventing the data's release. The release of the data showed a shocking number of schools below the CDC's recommended immunization rate of 95%, and an increasing trend of parents using a religious exemption to avoid vaccinating their children despite the lack of any underlying health issue preventing them from being vaccinated. The legislature took notice and then took action, and began working toward a number of initiatives to improve vaccination rates. The series of news stories, which won both a LION Publishers award as well as the Public Service Journalism award from the Connecticut Society of Professional Journalists. More importantly, the coverage opened the conversation about personal responsibility within the context of public health and, almost as though it was foreshadowing the COVID-19 pandemic, the coverage positioned us as a go-to source of information for the arrival of a disease far more deadly than measles.","Introducing CTNewsJunkie.com, a Connecticut news site that understands the usual media offerings just aren’t enough.

We've tipped elections with our endorsements, run corrupt public officials out office, restored voting access, exposed practices that prey on the poor and just last week were the first in our state to cover the shortage of reagents limiting COVID-19 testing capabilities. 
We have been on the forefront of Omaha's cultural explosion over the last 25 years. We're a leader in our city and state in collaborative coverage, not only with El Perico (we own), but also the local Hispanic and Black press, community radio, journalism start-ups and local TV.
After 26 years, where to start? Our collaborative journalism leadership has had a direct impact on progressive change in our community in a multitude of ways. One prime example is the time we helped facilitate a Brown-Black alliance to fight a draconian closing of polling places ahead of the 2012 election. Our investigative reporting and data analysis, shared with the local ABC affiliate, helped these communities fight to restore more than a 1/2 of polling places that were to be closed. From beating the New York Times and The Economist on the multi-path appeals-court tactics of local immigration ordinances driven by nativist Kris Kobach, to tipping the balance in elections to stop a nativist mayor, to highlighting inequities in the justice system that allow companies to exploit debts of the poor built on ProPublica coverage, we have been instrumental to building a progressive dialogue in our community. 
Prior to the pandemic, having brought the Solutions Journalism Network to introduce solutions journalism to media ranging from community and rural radio, to the daily newspaper and local network affiliates, we were poised to work with local foundations to bring Impact Media Funders to Omaha to help build a framework for local, diverse media support, built around progressive issues-focused coverage. 
We have worked closely over the years to cover and provide offline support to the efforts of community organizing groups like the Heartland Workers Center to help drive double digit increases in voter engagement in targeted Black and Hispanic precincts. With hundreds of job fairs under our belt, thousands of local HR contacts and tens of thousands of registered job-seekers on OmahaJobs.com, we’re best positioned to bring new skills and to help transform the local economy with an empowered workforce.","The Reader is Nebraska’s only nationally-recognized alternative newsmonthly, part of the Pioneer Publishing family which also includes El Perico and OmahaJobs.com.
