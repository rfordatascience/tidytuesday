<P>
<P>
You have downloaded "comma-separated value" (CSV) files which contain delimited-record representations of the tables in the report referenced above.  These CSV files can be imported into spreadsheets, or can be processed easily by other types of software.
<P>
The file<b> <a href="hcny_index.htm">hcny_index.htm</a></b> is among the files you have downloaded.  It contains table descriptions and file names for the CSV files.
<P>
Each line in a given CSV file represents one line in the published table (exception: there is a separate line for each footnote, regardless of how the footnotes are presented in the published table).
<P>
The first two values on the line are not part of the table.  The first value is a table number.  The second value is a line "type", as follows:
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
       t = title line<BR>
       h = column heading line<BR>
       u = units definition line<BR>
       d = data line<BR>
       c = the horizontal "closing" line (___) at the bottom of the table<BR>
       f = footnote
