# Week 30 - Horror Movies and Profit

## [Scary Movies Are The Best Investment In Hollywood](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/scary-movies-are-the-best-investment-in-hollywood/) - FiveThirtyEight

"Horror movies get nowhere near as much draw at the box office as the big-time summer blockbusters or action/adventure movies — the horror genre accounts for only 3.7 percent of the total box-office haul this year — but there’s a huge incentive for studios to continue pushing them out.

The return-on-investment potential for horror movies is absurd.

For example, “Paranormal Activity” was made for $450,000 and pulled in $194 million — 431 times the original budget. That’s an extreme, I-invested-in-Microsoft-when-Bill-Gates-was-working-in-a-garage case, but it’s not rare. And that’s what makes horror such a compelling genre to produce."
