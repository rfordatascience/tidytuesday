# Malaria Dataset

A lot of different options this week - all related to malaria data.


## Data Challenge
There is a [Data Challenge](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn16788291/wiki/583310) hosted by the Wellcome Trust and Sage Bionetworks using the [`malariaAtlas`](https://github.com/malaria-atlas-project/malariaAtlas) package of data and tools. It is officially open as of November 14th, 2018, with the potential to net a Â£15k (~$19,531) prize ! You can still access the package to use the mapping tools and access their dataset.

A lot of it is related to mapping, feel free to dive in and participate in their challenge or just stay within `#TidyTuesday`!

## Our World In Data
Alternatively, if you'd rather work with some simple aggregated malaria data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/malaria), you can see many different summary-level datasets related to malaria incidence by region, age, or time.

__3 Datasets:__
* [`malaria_inc.csv`](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2018-11-13/malaria_inc.csv) - Malaria incidence by country for all ages across the world across time
* [`malaria_deaths.csv`](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2018-11-13/malaria_deaths.csv) - Malaria deaths by country for all ages across the world and time.
* [`malaria_deaths_age.csv`](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2018-11-13/malaria_deaths_age.csv) - Malaria deaths by age across the world and time.
