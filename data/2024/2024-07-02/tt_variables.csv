2019,6,recessions,characteristics,character,14,"A banking panic and a collapse in the money supply took place in the United States that was exacerbated by international commitment to the gold standard.[47][48][49]Extensive new tariffs and other factors contributed to an extremely deep depression.[50] GDP, industrial production, employment, and prices fell substantially. The economy began to recover in the mid 30s with gold inflow expanding the money supply and improving expectations but double dipped during the Recession of 1937-38. The ultimate recovery has been credited to monetary policy and monetary expansion.[51]","The subprime mortgage crisis led to the collapse of the United States housing bubble. Falling housing-related assets contributed to a global financial crisis, even as oil and food prices soared. The crisis led to the failure or collapse of many of the United States' largest financial institutions: Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, Citi Bank and AIG, as well as a crisis in the automobile industry. The government responded with an unprecedented $700 billion bank bailout and $787 billion fiscal stimulus package. The National Bureau of Economic Research declared the end of this recession over a year after the end date.[73] The Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow) finally reached its lowest point on March 9, 2009.[74]",Paragraph description of the recession

Food, jobs, nookie... apparently the army is more fun than you thought.&#10;&#10;","ZULUS ON THE RAMPARTS! is the battle cry of those defending the Mission Station at Rorke&rsquo;s Drift. It is 22 January 1879, and the British invasion column moving into Zululand was disastrously defeated that morning at nearby Isandlwana. Now, fresh troops from the victorious Zulu iMpi (army) are advancing on your position. With your 140 British soldiers and auxiliaries, you must survive the repeated attacks of 4000+ crack Zulu warriors.&#10;&#10;This States of Siege&trade; game puts you squarely in command of a desperate defense. As events unfold and heroes emerge, can you build up the barricades and fill the breaches before the camp is overrun? As the Zulus relentlessly charge wielding their deadly spears and as British rifles overheat, can you keep cool and make the command decisions necessary to hold your position and repel the onrush of fierce braves until the Relief Column arrives?&#10;&#10;The Battle of Rorke&rsquo;s Drift saw more Victoria Crosses awarded than any other before or since. Can you write an equally glorious page in history as you confront these ZULUS ON THE RAMPARTS! ?&#10;&#10;Game Data:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 3 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 9 on a 9 scale&#10;Scale: Each unit is one Zulu iButho (Regiment); each turn is about 15-45 minutes of real time.&#10;&#10;Polybag Game Components:&#10;&#10;&bull;    One 40-page, color Game Rules booklet&#10;&bull;    82 thick, multi-shaped, laser-cut game pieces (some assembly required)&#10;&bull;    50 Action cards&#10;&bull;    One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; color game map&#10;&bull;    Four six-sided 5mm dice&#10;&#10;What's In The Box?:&#10;&#10;&bull;    One 40-page, color Game Rules booklet&#10;&bull;    82 thick, multi-shaped, laser-cut game pieces (some assembly required)&#10;&bull;    50 Action cards&#10;&bull;    One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; color game map&#10;&bull;    Four six-sided 12mm dice&#10;&bull;    One 11&quot; x 17&quot; mounted, jigsaw-cut game map&#10;&bull;    One bright red, 9 1/4&quot; x 5 7/8&quot; Standard cardboard VPG game box&#10;&bull;    One beautiful box cover sleeve&#10;&bull;    One &quot;Wipes-A-Lot&quot; napkin&#10;&bull;    One charcoal dessicant packet&#10;&#10;",NA

Meet Radhe! A Shepherd/ Lab mix, he is 10 months old and weighs almost 45 pounds. His short coat of tan, accented with clean white, is soft to the touch and great to stroke. This is a good thing because he loves cuddling . Radhe is a spunky sort of guy , he would be great for active family or single who loves to go for runs, or hikes. He is very smart. He does well with most other dogs and is excited to meet everyone, dog or human, he comes across. He is also gets along well with cats. He is housebroken and crate trained (with a nice, soft blanket in it, of course!). Such a sweetie! 6/ 14/19


*It is rare that we know with certainty the ages or mixes that make up our wonderful dogs, but we do our best to be as accurate as possible based upon our many years in rescue.** Adoption: 225 which covers TRANSPORT, quarantine, shots, worming, food, medical records, spaying/neutering, microchip and an Alabama State Health Certificate. Transport. 

 We consider the transport to be of great importance and, as such, take particular care of the dogs during the trip from Alabama. We make every effort to arrive with healthy and minimally stressed dogs.

She enjoys running around the backyard, but is happiest curled up beside her person on the couch. Zora will always be happy when you get home. She wiggles with excitement when she sees you, gives little licks, and is overall a very happy girl. Zora is great on hikes and does well on walks. She can be a little nervous at first, but warms up with time and patience. While she doesn't mind other dogs (she basically ignores them),√Ç¬†Zora is looking for a quiet, adults only home where she is the only dog and can soak up all of her family√¢¬Ä¬ôs love and affection.

2020,4,spotify_songs,energy,double,952,0.000175,1,"Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy."
2020,4,spotify_songs,key,double,12,0,11,"The estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C‚ôØ/D‚ô≠, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1."
2020,4,spotify_songs,loudness,double,10222,-46.448,1.275,The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks.

The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks."
2020,4,spotify_songs,acousticness,double,3731,0,0.994,A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.

Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly ""vocal"". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0."
2020,4,spotify_songs,liveness,double,1624,0,0.996,Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.

This morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen
Since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel like
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
'Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is, you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday, yeah 
Is everything has changed
And all my walls
Stood tall painted blue
But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down and open up the door for you
And all I feel
In my stomach, is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel like
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
'Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday, yeah
Is everything has changed
Come back and tell me why
I'm feelin' like I've missed you all this time
(Uh-uh-uh)
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
All I know is we said hello
Your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday, yeah
Is everything has changed
All I know is we said hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday, yeah
Is everything has changed
","Your little hands wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in and turn on your favorite nightlight
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have honey
If you could stay like that
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
No one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up
You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out
Someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your p.j.s getting ready for school
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
And no one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up
Oh I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
Could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please try to never grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just never grow up

2023,35,fair_use_findings,key_facts,character,251,"At issue in this case were the rights to the 1954 film Rear Window, starring James Stewart, and the short story on which the film was based. In 1945, the short story‚Äôs author, Cornell Woolrich, assigned film rights for the first twenty-eight-year copyright term to a motion picture production company, promising to renew the copyright and assignment for the second twenty-eight- year term. But in 1968, Woolrich died before he could complete the renewal or assignment. A trust subsequently renewed the copyright in 1969 and assigned the renewal rights to plaintiff Sheldon Abend, a literary agent. In 1971, defendants Jimmy Stewart, Alfred Hitchcock, and MCA, Inc., successors in interest to Woolrich‚Äôs 1945 assignment of film rights, broadcast the film on ABC‚Äôs television network. They ignored plaintiff‚Äôs notice to stop infringing his renewal rights. Plaintiff sued defendants in 1974 and the case settled for $25,000. Years later, defendants re-released the picture through a variety of media, including movie theaters, cable TV, and film rentals and plaintiff sued again. While the district court held that defendants‚Äô continued exploitation of the film was a fair use, the Ninth Circuit reversed and defendants petitioned to the U.S. Supreme Court.","Whether defendant‚Äôs appropriation artwork, which incorporated plaintiff‚Äôs photographs, must comment on, relate to the historical context of, or critically refer back to the plaintiff‚Äôs original work to qualify for a fair use defense.",The key facts of the case.
2023,35,fair_use_findings,issue,character,248,"The appeals court held that the law imposes no requirement that a work comment on the original or its author in order be considered transformative. It concluded that twenty-five of the thirty works at issue constituted fair use. The court found those works transformative because defendant‚Äôs ‚Äúcomposition, presentation, scale, color palette, and media are fundamentally different and new compared to the photographs, as is the expressive nature of [defendant‚Äôs] work.‚Äù The court also found no evidence that defendant‚Äôs work usurped either the primary or derivative market for plaintiff‚Äôs photographs. As to the other five works, the court remanded to the district court for further consideration under the proper standard.","Whether, for the purpose of news reporting, it was a fair use for defendant to use plaintiff‚Äôs copyrighted footage of a riot without permission.",A brief description of the fair use issue.
2023,35,fair_use_findings,holding,character,251,"Affirming the district court, the Second Circuit held that defendant‚Äôs unauthorized copying of the journal articles was not fair use. In reaching its conclusion, the court found that defendant‚Äôs actions were ‚Äúpart of a systematic process of encouraging employee researchers to copy articles so as to multiply available copies while avoiding payment.‚Äù Specifically, the court found that employees were simply making copies for convenience, which it did not consider to be a transformative use. Further, the court found that the employees were copying articles in their entirety, and such copying interfered with the commercial value publishers derive from the articles via subscriptions and licensing agreements.","With three fair use factors weighing in favor of fair use and one factor neutral, the court found the coaches‚Äô uses of WIN were fair use. The first factor, the purpose and character of the use, favored fair use because while the verbatim copying was not transformative, the coaches‚Äô uses were educational because they aimed to teach athletic ‚Äúlessons in good sportsmanship and fair play.‚Äù Additionally, the coaches‚Äô uses were noncommercial because neither the coaches nor the Board of Education profited from displaying the passage. The second factor, the nature of the work, also favored fair use because WIN had been published and the passage had been widely distributed online prior to the coaches‚Äô uses, so Bell‚Äôs right to control WIN‚Äôs first publication was not affected. Further, WIN was a mix of fact and fiction, which ‚Äúd[id] not persuade the Court in either direction.‚Äù The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, was neutral. Defendant‚Äôs copying was minimal in quantity, as the passage is a small portion of the WIN book, but substantial in quality, as the passage is the heart of the WIN book. The fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the work, favored fair use. The court explained that when a use is noncommercial, the burden of demonstrating market harm rests with the copyright holder. At the time of Defendant‚Äôs uses, Bell did not hold a separate copyright registration for the passage alone, so the court considered the market harm for the WIN book as a whole. Beyond ‚Äúconclusory statements‚Äù that Defendant‚Äôs uses, if widespread, would adversely impact the market for WIN, Bell was unable to present evidence demonstrating a connection between Defendant‚Äôs uses and harm to the market for WIN‚Äôs book sales or speaking engagements. The court observed Defendant‚Äôs uses may actually help the market for Bell‚Äôs work by enhancing his reputation.",The decision of the court in paragraph form.

Controls are omitted, as appropriate, for estimates within sectors or by demographic group [i.e., by class, gender, race, or industry sector]. Workers who do not report earnings but instead have them imputed [i.e., assigned] by the Census are removed from the estimation samples in all years, except 1994 and 1995 when imputed earners cannot be identified. Inclusion of imputed earners causes union wages to be understated, nonunion wages overstated, and union-nonunion wage differences understated.

Either the model itself or the experimental readouts will be required to incorporate AD/ADRD risk factors, pathologies, or relevant comorbidities. To this end, proposals can focus on one or more of the following: - Mechanistic studies that address how COVID-19 impacts CNS pathology and cognitive outcomes when AD/ADRD pathology is already present (for example, in a model of AD/ADRD). - Mechanistic studies that address how COVID-19 accelerates AD/ADRD pathology and cognitive deficits in a prodromal model (early phase, pre-symptomatic). - Mechanistic studies that address how COVID-19 predisposes for AD/ADRD and/or interacts with relevant comorbid conditions and risk factors (cellular mechanisms that could potentially increase the risk for future AD/ADRD).""","With this solicitation, the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) is continuing its support of research expansion for Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs). The goal of the CISE-MSI program is to broaden participation by increasing the number of CISE-funded research projects from MSIs and to develop research capacity toward successful submissions to core CISE programs. MSIs are central to inclusive excellence: they foster innovation, cultivate current and future undergraduate and graduate computer and information science and engineering talent, and bolster long-term U.S. competitiveness. For the purposes of this solicitation, MSIs include Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), and Tribal College & Universities (TCUs).","Free text description of the opportunity.
