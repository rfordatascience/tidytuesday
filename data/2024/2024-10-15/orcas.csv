2024,2024-10-06,1,100,10:48:00,12:21:00,5580s (~1.55 hours),Mike 1,"Mark Malleson,Joe Zelwietro","K, L",NA,Swiftsure Bank,48.5105018615723,-124.692497253418,48.5263328552246,-124.860000610352,"After Mark’s encounter with members of K and L pod the previous day, he and Joe were eager to take advantage of a rare perfect weather day in the Juan de Fuca and complete another survey. They departed just after 0800 with a full tank of fuel and Fin in tow.
Their aim was to get back to where Mark had found the foraging animals the day prior, southwest of Port Renfrew; the feed had appeared plentiful and it seemed unlikely the whales would have moved far. Sure enough, as they exited the Juan de Fuca westbound, they spotted several fast-moving whales also travelling west.
The first animal they photographed was mature bull L87, apparently the easternmost whale in the grouping, though he was pacing L22 closely. L72 and L105 were travelling just inshore and ahead of them, trailing a large tight group that appeared to contain much of the rest of L pod. This larger group turned out to be a mix of the L4 and L12 matrilines, suggesting that all of L pod but perhaps the L54s were present. They team spent the next several minutes documenting as many of these animals as they could, including all members of the L12 subgroup – L25 was alone ahead of the others leading the westward charge – and all of the L4s.
Based on the behaviour of the animals and their proximity to the apparently rich feeding area from the day prior, along with the absence of K pod, Mark assumed there may be others ahead. The Mike 1 team eased ahead of the Ls and just a mile and a half beyond them, found several spread members of K pod, apparently foraging.
The quickly travelling Ls arrived shortly and joined the cadre of Ks – and as the team soon found, the L54s and L88. K16 and L88 were foraging together, K35 near. K20 and young K45 were not far from them, foraging near K12, K14, K37, K22 and the hulking K33. L87 appeared now alongside L25, and for the next little while Mark and Joe did their best to document each new individual they could. This was made challenging by the somewhat long/deep sounding dives they observed from the animals, though the incredible number of gulls diving for the scraps made relocating them easier. As a whole, the animals appeared robust, and it was good to see such successful foraging for a sustained period.
They ended the encounter early in the afternoon as the group continued their spread foraging behaviour, and began making way east, back into the Juan de Fuca.
The only members of L pod not observed this day were of the L47 matriline (including L83), from which no whales were photographed, as well as L90 and her calf L128. The assumption is that they were not far, perhaps inshore and behind the earlier photographed animals, and when they reached the feeding grounds became too dispersed for the team to detect them. Mark did photograph several members of the group the day prior, including L83 and L90 alongside the clan’s newest addition (see Encounter #99). J pod was not present, and has been observed in the southern reaches of the Salish Sea over the past week.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-100

The team met at Snug Harbor and left on “Orcinus” at 0910. We got on scene at 0930 about a mile off Hannah Heights. L90 and L128 were tight together, as one would expect, and pointed slowly up Haro Strait. Despite early hopes of other whales being around, L90 and L128 were the only two SRs seen in the strait. The pair were near the border but not so close that we couldn’t get the drone up over them. We attempted one photo-ID pass but L90 turned away from us before we could even get within 200 hundred yards. It was clear she was not ready for anyone to be close yet, so we stopped trying and took proof of presence photos from a distance while we flew over them. We were able to get good enough shots with the drone to confirm a right eyepatch, should we need to. The calf was also seen nursing, which is good news.

The next morning, researchers were hoping some whales would still be on the west side of SJI, but the only morning report was of a few whales heading west at Sooke. We had planned an early morning whale search, but this was called off due to “KCB3” having a starboard engine issue. Early afternoon, a couple of whales were seen and photographed at Lime Kiln. Photos posted by Ashley Whitman showed L90 with a brand-new calf. This threw everyone into a tizzy as L90 had never been documented with a calf before, despite multiple suspected pregnancies. We had to scramble a bit to find people and make a plan, as “KCB3” was down an engine. We weren’t the only researchers with boat issues as “Orcinus” was on loan to SR3 due to their own research vessel being out of action. The plan was for Dave to go out in “Orcinus” with John Durban and Holly Fearnbach of SR3 to try to get ID shots of L90 and her new calf as well as getting SR3's drone up and over the mom and calf for their photogrammetry project. Michael, Rachel, and Charli would go out in”KCB3” to see if they could get anything with one running engine. Both boats left Snug Harbor a little after 1400.

L90 and her new calf were in Andrews Bay when we got on scene a few minutes after leaving the harbor. The two whales were non-directional and surfacing irregularly. It looked like it might take a bit of gentle persistence to get the type of ID shots we would like to have when documenting new calves. In “Orcinus”, we launched SR3’s drone since it didn’t seem like we would be getting good ID photos anytime soon. Since L90 was staying under for long periods without going on a long dive, the drone was helpful in letting the boat driver/ID photographer (Dave) know when L90 was coming up. Still, L90 was keeping a distance from everyone, and the calf did not always come up right after her, so getting photos was hard. Around 1525, L90 and the calf began heading slowly down island near Smugglers Cove, tight to the shoreline. L90 was pretty much hugging the contour of the island, even going in behind Sunset Point. “KCB3” headed back to Snug at 1545. While we were able to keep the drone over L90, we were not getting anything more in ID photos other than proof that a calf existed. The pair made their way down to the south end of LandBank when they turned and began to fast travel back up island. We were able to get a decent ID shot of L90, but she was running screen on the calf and the best Dave could get was a tiny dorsal disappearing behind mom. We ended the encounter around 1700 off Bellevue Point, after L90 stopped suddenly and turned down island again. 
While we were hoping for better eyepatch shots of the new calf, the SR3 team got good enough images of it to confirm its existence. This is L90’s first documented calf and it has been designated L128. The calf was not present when L90 was photographed near the Fraser River on September 13th and was probably born the next day sometime. L90 is now our oldest first-time mother at age 31.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-95

We had made it most of the way up towards Point Roberts when we saw a report of whales north of the Coal Docks, so that gave us a little more hope of finding something up there. The weather wasn’t really bad, but it was breezy enough for there to be a 1-2 foot chop. We had made it almost to the main mouth of the Fraser River, when we saw whales and the encounter began at 1034.

The whales were spread out and foraging in the midst of hundreds of sport fishing boats. We tried to go to the northwest edge of the scene and worked the whales on the periphery of the sport fishing fleet. Most of the whales were pointed northeast until they got around the edge of the delta and then turned north towards Howe Sound. We started out seeing mostly K pod whales but members of the L4s, and L47s began showing up mixed in with them. Small groups began forming as the whales emerged out of the boats. Some of the groups seemed social although individual whales were still probably foraging. K45 and L125 were enjoying themselves while they played with one another. K43 was also socializing with the two little ones. K45 breached several times while goofing around. The L72s showed up towards the end of the encounter. L90 was photographed without a calf. We ended the encounter at 1205 off the airport on Sea Island with the whales heading north towards Howe Sound.

The forecast for wind was not favorable, and we didn’t really have enough daylight to make the slog out to the whales worth it, so we would have to wait until morning. SRs were heard on the hydrophones that night and we had a plan to be off the dock by 8am. We all met at Snug in the morning and did make it off the dock by 0806. There was another report of whales heading northeast at East Point at 0745.
After heading through Johns Pass and up Boundary Pass, we passed East Point by 0840. We sighted whales soon afterwards and the encounter started at 0845 east of Tumbo Island. At first, we thought we had multiple pods because it looked like a lot of whales, but it was just J pod spread out abreast in a loose formation. They were traveling slowly north and appeared to be resting. They may have been waking up as the J19s and others moved ahead a little and other groups seemed to ooze towards the west. We made sure we had a proof of presence photo on everybody before we ended the encounter at 0926 a little northwest of where it started.

The whales passed Anacortes, and we got on scene at 1253, north of Shannon Point. There was one small group and some spread out peripheral whales. The main group consisted of T100, T100C, T100F, T37A, and T37A2 and they were pointed west. About a quarter mile north of them, we found T37A4 and T100E milling around together. T101 was also nearby. They formed a loose threesome that headed west before turning southeast back toward the main group who was still heading west toward Thatcher Pass.

T101A and T101B had been reported to have split off to the north and were closer to the south shoreline of Cypress Island. We eventually caught sight of the pair and headed that direction. T101A and T101B were traveling west across Rosario Strait and were loosely spread. They joined up tight once or twice before loosening up again as they traveled toward Thatcher Pass. They passed Lawson Reef and headed into Thatcher Pass on the Blakely Island side. The other whales were also making their way into the pass with most of the whales taking the north side, a few whales in the middle, and T100, T100C, and T100F on the north shoreline of Decatur Island. We moved over to the T100s as most of the other whales turned north-northwest on the Blakely Island side. The T100s turned north off the northwest tip of Decatur Island and passed close to the Frost Island eastern shoreline. The T100s were the westernmost whales while the others were more mid-channel as they turned northwest towards Upright Head on the north tip of Lopez Island.

The whales were mostly in a single tight group although T137A and maybe another whale or two were trailing the others when we arrived. We got the drone up for a couple of flights as the whales traveled east along the south side of Lopez Island. The trailing whales caught up with the group and, other then one jag to the south off Iceberg Point, they all continued east. The other whales besides the T137s ended up being the T36s, T124Ds, and T124A1. The whales were being somewhat social as they traveled.

These whales were identified by vessels on scene as the T35As, a group that we rarely encounter that far east in the Salish Sea, potentially accompanied by the T38As. The team geared up and left Snug at 13:28.

The team arrived on scene at 14:20 just north of Alden Bank. The whales were milling when the team arrived, apparently just finishing processing a kill. As the team slowly approached the area, the whales began moving slowly east. The team took the opportunity to do a left-side photo-ID pass, and confirmed that it was just the T35As present.

After the photo-ID pass, the team moved away from the whales and launched the drone. During their flights, they observed the whales chasing a harbor porpoise. After diving to capture the porpoise, yet another porpoise appeared: a calf! The whales chased and eventually caught both mother and calf. The mother was briefly released, apparently so T35A4 could practice chasing and catching it. The porpoise proved a bit too big for the young whale to hold onto, forcing the adults to step in and finish the hunt.

The whales prey shared and socializing for the next several minutes before again turning directional and heading northeast. As the team got into position for a photo ID pass, the whales spread out over a half mile. The team got a couple more photos of part of the group, but with the light getting lower and the whales spread, they decided to end the encounter at 16:06 and head back to Snug.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-90

Mark confirmed that he was observing members of the T075Bs—specifically T075B2, T075B3, and T075B4. After several minutes, it became clear that prey sharing was indeed occurring, as indicated by a small slick that formed near the whales. Minutes later, the trio moved northwest along the Valdez shoreline, with T075B2 leading the group through the two-foot chop.

Upon arriving at the west entrance of Active Pass, he paused for a binocular scan to check if the whales were still visible. Given the elapsed time, they could have moved south into Swanson Channel or northwest into Trincomali Channel. Enough time had passed that the whales were likely out of his view either way, and the ebb tide would have further helped their progress if they’d opted to move south. 

Mark decided to approach a sport fisher off Collinson Point to inquire if they had seen the whales exit the pass and if they could confirm their direction of travel. The first boat he asked reported seeing the whales heading south towards Portlock Point on Prevost Island just 20 minutes earlier. This information was promising, but once he reached Portlock Point several minutes later and stopped for a scan, the whales were still nowhere to be found. Mark was baffled that he wasn't seeing them; given the recent report and ideal conditions, he began questioning the fisherman's information. 

Just as he was preparing to retrace his route towards Trincomali Channel, another sport fisher who had also been at Collinson Point and overheard Mark asking about killer whales slowed down as they approached Mike 1. Mark approached them for more details, and they informed him that they had seen the whales loop up Trincomali Channel. Mark then proceeded up Trincomali Channel, favouring the northern side, moving slowly and stopping for frequent scans. During his third scan, he heard faint blows to the west but couldn't immediately spot any dorsal fins. He continued toward where he'd heard the blows and eventually stopped a mile to the west. He began to hear the blows again, this time more clearly, and after a quick scan, he finally locked on to the whales! 

There appeared to be three or four killer whales spread out, and it took over 20 minutes before Mark managed to get a photograph of one as they were extremely cryptic - quite possibly the most cryptic whales of the year! The whales would surface 2 or 3 times before disappearing for ~6 minutes. Mark eventually confirmed that he had T023 and a group of three within a half mile, which included her daughter, T023D, and grandkids, T023D4 and T023D5. 

After an hour of starting the encounter, the group of four whales was tight together on the Galiano side of the channel. There was still no sign of the sprouter, T023D3, so Mark decided to end the encounter slightly east of Wallace Island and head towards Porlier Pass in case he was ahead of the group. He also wanted to have a scan for other animals in the Strait of Georgia, as there was an earlier shore-based report of additional animals heading northwest on the north side of Galiano. Mark later received a report on his return from Porlier Pass that T023D3 had appeared along the Saltspring side of Trincomali Channel and managed to photograph him at the west end of Wallace Island.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-87

He was sent a video taken from shore, which revealed the unmistakable fin of T019B, also known as ""Galiano,"" a 29-year-old bull. Alongside T019B were his mother and brother, who had been seen roaming the San Juan Islands and southern Vancouver Island with the T049As, minus the eldest sons, T049A1 and T049A2. 

Mark figured that the commercial whale-watching boats would soon find the whales, so he decided to head back to Victoria. He planned to retrace his route south through Porlier, with a quick detour to the west end of the Secretary Islands for proof-of-presence photos of T023D3 (see Encounter 87) and a bathroom break at Wallace Island for Fin. 

To his surprise, nearly an hour after the South Pender sighting, the commercial whale-watching boats had yet to locate the group. With this update, Mark decided to head toward the top end of North Pender to see if he could find them. As he approached Otter Bay at 1424, approximately 6 nautical miles and 1.5 hours from the original sighting, he spotted the whales along the northwestern shoreline of the ferry terminal! 

Mark immediately confirmed that it was indeed the group of eight whales he had suspected from the video he received when he approached the wide, left-leaning fin of T019B and the uniquely rippled fin of his 23-year-old brother, T019C.

The T36s and T137s were moving quickly along the Orcas shoreline, and we quickly got the drone up over them. During a long dive, the whales turned north towards Barnes Island. The whales were in two tight groups, loosely spread and paralleling one another. The group that was about fifty yards to the west of the other included the T36Bs and T137D while the other group had the rest of the T137s, T36 herself, and T65A5. T36B3 was not present. The western group became the lead group by about the same margin as the whales headed north a little off Barnes Island’s west shoreline. At 1533, members of the lead group briefly began speed swimming at the surface as they rounded the north tip of Barnes Island. That group went into obvious hunting mode in between the north ends of Barnes and Clark Islands.

The commercial boat that sighted them believed they may have seen K26 in the mix. J pod had been reported the previous evening, heading south in the Strait of Georgia near East Point. It was possible that Ks, and perhaps even the Ls, had entered the Juan de Fuca Strait and met up with the Js. Alternatively, it was possible that with the poor visibility, K26 might have been mistaken for the fast-growing J38. 

Mark received a call from Michael, who inquired if he would be heading out on Mike 1 to confirm the identity of the group. By mid-afternoon, the fog had lifted, and reports indicated that the whales were now slightly south of Race Rocks, still heading northwest and angling towards East Sooke Park, so Mark quickly mobilized Mike 1. 

At 1649, while transiting through Race Passage, Mark spotted his first whales as one breached offshore of Church Rock. As he approached, he observed 3 or 4 individuals spread out, moving towards Becher Bay. The first whale he identified was J58, who was foraging alongside her grandmother, J19. At one point, it appeared that J19 caught something and shared it with J58 before they separated and continued westward. Mark then spotted J58's mother, J41, and her older brother, J51. He also noticed what he initially thought was a large male sprouter offshore, which turned out to be 21-year-old J39. 

With no further signs of whales on the horizon, Mark decided to head further south and west in the hopes of locating the leading group. Despite several miles of searching in the middle of the Strait and multiple binocular scans, he found no additional whales. While returning along the Canadian side, within a mile of the Sooke shoreline, he reacquired the original four whales and soon noticed more J pod members appearing offshore, beginning to group together. 

Mark successfully photographed additional individuals: J38, J45, and J37 with her two-year-old calf, J59. He confirmed the presence of J27 but was unable to get a clear photo before J27 went on a long foraging dive. Mark concluded the encounter at 1758, deciding it was time to return to Victoria.

J pod was spread out in singles and small groups while heading slowly southwest down Boundary Pass. J26 and few other spread-out whales got by us and the first group we got on was the J22s with J37 and J59 traveling together. Since we were on the US side of the border, we got the drone up for the first of several flights throughout the encounter. J39 and J49 were traveling together a couple hundred yards behind the J22s and the rest of the J37s. J31, J40, J42, J45, J46, J53, and J56 showed up and all three groups merged into one strung out and loosely spread group.

The day was slightly breezy so we had to bounce our way southwest across Haro Strait. Disappointingly, the whales were reported to have turned around and were now heading southwest. There was some doubt as to whether the effort would be worth it, but we decided to bounce on.

We arrived on scene at 1259 off the southeast corner of Constance Bank. We first saw a group of five that was trailing another larger group about a half mile to the northwest of the trailing group. The trailing group of five did not have anyone watching them so we started there. This group consisted of T117A, T117B, T117B1, T172, and T65A3. They were being somewhat social as they traveled west into sloppy seas. The choppy water meant we saw a lot of chins of surfacing whales but it was hard to catch it when one is stumbling around trying to keep the whales in the frame. We got as good of lefts on this group as conditions would allow before deciding to move on to the larger group. About halfway between the two groups, we saw T49C traveling west-northwest by himself. T49C was taking half minute short dives so it was hard to predict where he’d come up. We got a few shots of him before moving on to the larger group.

The large group was loosely stretched out and were also looking quite social as they traveled west. Several of the young whales were breaching and splashing. This group was being watched by several boats and were moving fairly quickly so we didn’t get that great of pass on them.

Looking up, he saw a small group of killer whales about half a mile offshore, heading in a line towards the Chain Islands. They were prowling through the kelp bed at Lee Rock, heading north towards Baynes Channel. He figured it was likely the T109A2s returning from the Bigg's Bash the day before, as they were identified in the group of about 40 individuals west of Race Rocks. T109A2 and her four offspring have been seen in the area over the last few weeks and seem to have claimed the shoreline between Victoria and Sidney as their territory.

Upon arrival, he confirmed it was indeed the T109A2s. They were moving in a tight group at 5 knots, heading purposefully towards Zero Rock.

Once again, the first two individuals photographed were L83 and L110! They were travelling ahead of but near the K20s and L86s, young K45 and L125 playfully trailing behind their respective mothers. K38 and L106 also shadowed the matriarchs, though not together. It was interesting watching the two lines interact, as both are three-animal families composed of mothers with elder sons and young daughters born 14-15 years later.
As they had later the day prior, as well as frequently during last year’s survey, the spread of whales seemed to be foraging hard in an area for anywhere from 10-30 minutes before charging off in a different direction. Intermittent courtship behaviour was also observed.
After an hour of shadowing members of K pod and the so-called “18 Ls”, the team finally detected some J pod whales along the southwestern edge of the spread, beginning with J31 and J56 foraging near L116. J38 was observed shortly thereafter, shadowing J39 as the younger whale chased down and courted L118 for a few moments. After some excitement above and below the surface, the two parted ways and J39 returned to some nearby J pod members.
The guys wrapped up the encounter after watching several members of J pod capture and perhaps share some prey, before returning to port to rest up for the final day of a so far successful survey.
No members of either the L12 or L54 subgroups were observed; it is possible that they were not present with the large group the Center’s team observed this day, or that they were present somewhere on the periphery of the group.

Dave quickly identified the first two killer whales photographed as L83 and her teenage son, L110…they had found the Southern Residents! Fortunately, the whales were converging into three or four large groups. This made the work efficient, and the team were soon able to identify many members of L pod, including both the L12 and L54 sub-groups, some of the lesser-seen whales in inside waters. L88 was not a part of this large group, though he is generally encountered alongside the L54s.
Unfortunately, L85 was again not observed with his cohort of the L12s, L22 and L25. L87 has for the moment taken his place alongside L22, and we do not expect to see L85 again.

The next large group contained almost all of J pod, the J17s lagging just behind the other 19 animals and a handful of Ks. As J pod has been documented quite thoroughly in Haro Strait and the area throughout June, the team did not linger after confirming the presence of each individual, and moved ahead to the next loose grouping, expecting and finding more of K pod and some of the missing Ls. L88 was near a tight group of K12s. The groups began to splinter as they reached their chosen foraging ground west of Swiftsure Bank, but the team managed to photograph the L55s and K20s, among others.

By the late afternoon, they had photographed every member of J Clan, ending the day how it began, with L83 and L110, this time watching the duo forage as they sauntered west.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-67

Day one was planned only as a transit to Bamfield to get set up, so they were pleased to get a mid-morning report of westbound killer whales nearing Sheringham Point, right on the way!
The team slowed Mike 1 offshore of Jordan River at 1139 and began the first encounter of the week-long survey with four spread killer whales. The first two they documented were T117B and her yearling, T117B1. Nearer to shore, but still over a mile south of the Jordan River outflow, was a large female presumed to be T172. In recent years, T117B – and lately her new little one – has primarily been observed with the T030Bs, but was instead observed the night prior alongside her elder brother T117A and his recent travel partner, T172, in Haro Strait. Sure enough, the third whale was quickly confirmed to be T172. She was initially travelling slightly ahead of the T117Bs, but angled offshore to meet them as they closed the gap. All three then angled offshore, toward Clallam Bay or Sekiu, at which point the guys decided to slowly move inshore, hoping to catch a glimpse of T117A as he made his way out to the others. 
Finding the big bull proved though difficult, as intermittent scans while the T117Bs and T172 were beneath yielded nothing. He eventually appeared nearly a mile northeast of the trio, also beginning to angle out toward the Olympic Coast. The crew on Mike 1 collected several ID shots as he turned offshore, and watched him aim for the others as they ended the encounter and continued their westward travels.
Note: These four whales were observed again the following day by commercial whale-watchers near Victoria, making their three day presence more than any of these individuals were documented in the area in all of 2023 (twice each). These typically rare animals have also been observed in the Salish Sea this year already, in winter and early spring; we are interested to see if this trend continues.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-65

Offshore of those two we found J47 traveling slowly south all by himself. Almost a mile to the southwest of him we found the J19s in a loose group. They were milling and socializing while playing with pieces of kelp. The J19s eventually turned north and headed slowly inshore towards SJI. About three quarters of a mile to the west of them, we found J44, J45, and J49 socializing together in a loose group. J46 joined this threesome and they split into two with J44 and J46 traveling inshore together towards Eagle Point and J45 and J49 continued socializing on their way south. Another half mile to the north of this group, we found the J16s (minus J26) and J53 traveling north together. We ended the photo-ID part of the encounter at 1201 off Hannah Heights and headed back to Snug Harbor for a midday break in the action.

The previous day, several groups of Bigg's killer whales had been spotted: the T037As were westbound south of Race Rocks, the T038As and T075Cs were eastbound off of East Sooke, and the T109A2s had met up with the T049As (less T049A1 and T049A2) near Race Rocks.

After scanning the area with binoculars between Race Rocks and south of Sooke, where Mark also took the opportunity to photograph the flukes of several humpback whales in the central strait, he decided it was time to head back to the harbour. One of his whale watch colleagues had also surveyed the shoreline up to Sheringham Point Lighthouse and had reported only seeing distant humpback blows, confirming the thoroughness of Mark's search.

At approximately 1050, while Mark was travelling east about 3 miles south of East Sooke Park, he received a call from another colleague who had located a large group of killer whales heading west, about one nautical mile south of Beechey Head. His colleague was initially uncertain of the ecotype of whales but Mark quickly arrived and confirmed through binoculars that they were indeed Bigg's killer whales. Specifically, Mark noted that they were two of the matrilines observed the previous day: the T035As and the T049As, minus T049A1 and T049A2.

The group of 10 whales were tightly knit, travelling at speeds between 7 and 8 knots. After approaching to within 50 metres to capture right-side photographs, Mark withdrew to allow his colleague and other commercial whale watch boats to observe without obstructing their view with the research boat. Within half an hour, as other boats departed to view the numerous humpbacks to the south, Mark moved in for one final series of pictures, this time capturing images of the whales' right sides.

Since we had planned for this to be mainly a drone day, we got the drone up for the first of several flights. J36 was foraging by herself behind and offshore of the J19s while J16 and J26 were traveling quickly north inshore. J26 stopped to mill briefly before continuing north.

Next we found J35 and J57 together in shore near Pile Point. After that, the day was a series of individuals and loose pairs spread out between Eagle Point and Hannah Heights. We saw J26 again, offshore this time. We saw J47 by himself, then J42 and J53 loosely foraging together. J44 was also in the area.

Wanting to see whether it was just J pod or if the L54s might still be with them, they decided to head out for a photo-ID survey. They mobilized and left the dock at 1215.

After passing Henry Island, the team soon saw their first blows. These first whales were the females of the J16 matriline: J16, J36, and J42. They porpoised south, travelling very fast. The team got quick proof of presence shots as they zoomed by, and then found their next group.

The team next found a single whale, J41, also porpoising south with purpose. Behind her was J19, who soon caught up and porpoised alongside her daughter. After a pass on these whales, the team moved to a whale they had spotted just behind this pair. There, they found J58, doing her best to keep up with the adults and also porpoising.

The team spotted a tall dorsal fin offshore. They went out into the middle of the strait where they found J39 on his own, keeping a slightly more leisurely pace. After a few shots of him, they moved inshore to a pair of whales hugging the Henry Island shoreline.

These next whales proved to be an interesting pairing of J51 and J40. These whales took a quick opportunity to look for fish off Kellet Bluff, but didn't appear to catch anything. Ahead of them, approaching San Juan County Park, we saw yet another tall dorsal fin, which proved to be J26 travelling on his own.

The team backtracked up the San Juan shoreline, where they found there biggest group of the day: J37 with her calf J59, J46, J31, and J22. These whales also travelled quickly south, but J59 took a few opportunities to breach as they travelled.

The team once again moved offshore to a group they had spotted while photographing the J pod females. They found two pairs, both engaged in vigorous social behavior. Closer to shore was J53 and J56, two young females who, despite not being very closely related, seem to have a very strong social bond. Offshore of them was J49 socializing with his uncle J45.

Even further off, the whales saw another tall fin on. Making their way out into the shipping lane, the team found J27 foraging on his own, but also generally moving south down the strait.

From where J27 was, the team couldn't see any other whales, but a quick chat with Straitwatch confirmed there was another group further inshore approaching Hannah Heights. The team putted that way, where they found J35 with her two sons, J47 and J57, moving leisurely through a tide rip.

The team could not see any whales further up island. They had found everyone in J pod but J38 and J44, and were fairly satisfied members of other pods were not present. With the day getting darker and wetter, and the whales spread out, they decided to call the encounter at 1526 and head back to Snug.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-61

After passing Mitchell Bay, the whales cut into Open Bay, swimming close to the rocks along the Henry Island shoreline, apparently looking for seals but not finding anything.

Based on their trajectory and the time that had passed, Mark calculated that the whales might be on approach to William Head. At 1252, after pushing their way through some unfavourable water, Brendon spotted the first set of fins passing along the shoreline at William Head - just as Mark had predicted. 

The whales appeared to be in a cohesive formation, yet unlike Js and Ks observed earlier, the L pod whales exhibited a varied composition. Initially, the first photographed group included L55, L83, L90, L105, L118, and the L72s. Their movements appeared scattered as the whales were spread out across the entrance to Pedder Bay, but the majority of whales were predominantly southbound against the incoming flood. At 1258, L55 spyhopped near Mike 1’s port side, followed by the other six whales moving southward behind her. Shortly thereafter, another group surfaced behind, consisting of the L77s along with L22, L25, and L87. Meanwhile, the remaining members of the L55s moved in parallel, while the L94s and L47s remained closer to the Vancouver Island shoreline. All matrilines were represented, except for the L54s, who had been traveling with J pod in the preceding weeks. 

By 1300, all whales were clearly southbound against the flood, making slow progress. As the whales moved through the kelp beds between Edye Point and Rocky Point, several members began tail-slapping, seemingly a blend of excitement and an effort to flush out hidden salmon. Their activity heightened further as multiple whales, including L110, L113, and L72, started spyhopping. Meanwhile, others in the pod began breaching and cartwheeling, including L55, L83, L103, L119, and the youngest member of the pod, L127.

Following a final breach from L87 on Mike 1’s starboard side, the pod of 29 whales began dispersing across Race Passage. Mark and Brendon concluded their observation at 1353, noting the whales' departure to the west.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-58

By 1000, Brendon contacted Mark to relay that he was seeing most of L pod from the shoreline, with the exception of the L54s. Following this sighting, Mark and Brendon promptly convened at Oak Bay Marina to prepare Mike 1 for departure. As they were navigating their course into a strong ebb while exiting the harbor, they received a report from Joe indicating that J pod and K pod had been spotted off Seabird Point, Discovery Island. Given their proximity to the location of these whales, Mark and Brendon altered course so as to document Js and Ks in better conditions.

At 1122, many tightly-knit whales surfaced together several hundred metres ahead of Mike 1 along Beaumont Shoals, heading northeast. This group comprised the entirety of J pod, with all matrilines in a tight formation. The most southern subset of whales were the J17s - including sprouting males J44 and J47 - followed by the J19s at the northern end. The pod maintained a steady eastward course towards the western side of San Juan Island, with no observed social or predation behaviour.

At 1130, shortly after photographing the Js, all of K pod began to catch up to the leading whales. Mike 1 remained stationary as J pod continued ahead of them, opting to remain in place for K pod to pass in favourable lighting conditions. Similarly, K pod was also tightly grouped, with exceptions noted for K16 and K35, who were the most eastern whales leading the formation. Among the trailing whales were the K12s, with K37 notably observed sporting a new nick and superficial damage to his dorsal fin. 

With conditions rapidly improving due to the incoming flood tide, Mark and Brendon decided to wrap up the encounter at 1150 AM after a view of the K13s; their aim was to reach the westbound group of L pod whales before the opportunity slipped away.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-57

It took some searching, but the team finally saw whales in the distance between Middle and Hein Bank. The team got in range of the whales at 1153 and started the encounter.

The first two whales the team found were J27 and J39, travelling together back towards San Juan Island. After a couple passes and behavior logs on the two brothers, the team moved off towards a larger group they had spotted to the northwest. There, the team found the J22s and J14s in a tight formation, also heading towards San Juan Island. Also in the area, but more spread out, were members of the J17 matriline: J44, J53, and J46. After a few minutes, these J17s joined in the formation with the other two matrilines.

The team wanted to try to get drone footage of this group, however the seas the whales were in were a bit too rough to safely launch and retrieve the aircraft. The team decided to move inshore where the water was flatter and wait for the whales to get to them. Unfortunately, as the whales neared this calm water, the weather turned and it began to rain, grounding the drone for the time being.

The team decided to move off towards reports of other southern residents near Landbank. Along the San Juan shoreline near Hannah Heights they found J42, foraging on her own. Further north, they found her brother J26, also foraging. A brief break in the rain allowed the team to launch the drone over J26, however the rain quickly returned and forced the team to land.

The whales were spread out, west to east, traveling north in three different pairs. We went to the middle pair first and they were the sprouter T65A3 and the almost sprouting T37B1. These two were socializing and tactile as they charged north in a bit of a tidal lump. They were preoccupied with one another, so we were able to get good lefts and rights on them with little difficulty. A few hundred yards to the east of them we found T34 and T34B traveling together. We got some backlit lefts on them before moving to the final pair and furthest west whales we could see. This was T37B and T37B3 and they were traveling slowly north together about 150 yards to the northwest of T37B1 and T65A3. We got a few rights on those two before deciding to call it quits. While we still hadn’t seen T37 and T34A who we might have expected to be there, the water was lumpy enough to discourage a whale search. We ended the encounter at 1130 about ¾ of a mile east of Mandarte Island. Most of the rest of the T65As had been found earlier somewhere off the east end of Spieden Island in much calmer water. The plan was to head back to Snug, do a quick crew change, and head back out on the T65As for some drone flights. See Encounter 49-2.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-48

The team got the drone in the air, and observed the whales sharing and processing a fresh porpoise kill. The whales milled for several minutes, eating and socializing. T65A2 exhibited the ""moonwalking"" behavior, where Bigg's killer whales will surface in reverse, as he positioned himself to share food with his siblings.

After a bit of eating, the whales shifted behavior and began travelling northeast. The team landed the drone and took on quick photo ID pass on the group. After their pass, the team ended the encounter at 1332 and headed back to the dock.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-49

They had been in contact with us over on San Juan Island so we knew that the L54s and L88 were coming in and making a rare early Summer appearance in inshore waters. After Mark and Joe went home and the whales crossed Haro Strait to the west side of San Juan Island, we gathered the team to see what the whales would do once they were in Haro Strait. The team met at Snug Harbor and left in “KCB3” at about 1316. 

We arrived on scene off Kanaka Bay at 1340. The first whale we saw was a male in the lead who turned out to be L88 and he was traveling north inshore towards Pile Point. We took some left sides on him and then moved back to a loose group of whales that were a couple hundred yards behind. This was a group of Js that included all the J14s plus J26 and J39. This group appeared to be social as they moved slowly north and inshore towards Pile Point. These whales moved up the SJI towards Hannah Heights so we moved offshore to find someone else. There were no whales showing up to the southeast and, about a mile or more offshore, we could only find the J22s and J27 spread out. Other then a few whales plastered to the SJI shoreline, we were having trouble finding any other whales. Proof of presence photos of taken of whales hdg north up the shoreline later revealed the J31s, J35s, J42, J53, and L54, along with members of the spread-out J pod group we had earlier off the north end of False Bay. We were not seeing any new whales although J27 moved inshore off Pile Point. We moved offshore and headed north up Haro around the whales coming up the SJI shoreline. Off of the County Park, we found a single female heading north by herself. This was L54 so we made sure we got some good left side shots of her as she traveled up Andrews Bay. Other whales were being extremely hard to spot in any direction. We thought there might be more whales to the south of us so we went all the way back to Bellevue Point looking for them. Whatever was down there, vanished, so we headed back north yet again.

Off CWR, two whales showed up from offshore and were socializing together. This was the two young males J51 and L117 and we made sure we got good lefts on them too. L54 also showed up again and was nearby. J51 and L117 began milling and then turned toward the boat. We looked down and saw a good-sized salmon swim right over to the stern with J51 and L117 in a slow pursuit. They slow chased the fish around the port side of the boat and looked like they caught it off our bow. More whales must have gone north than we thought since whales were beginning show up out of the woodwork from the north while we were off Smugglers Cove. J27 showed up and he was heading slowly south. L88 also reappeared and he was milling around in Mitchell Bay. The J37s passed us heading south fairly quickly. J26 showed up and he joined L88 and the two of them milled around together between the south end of Mitchell Bay and CWR. They moved inshore so we moved offshore a little but were not seeing a whole lot of whales out there. We saw J39 again slowly heading south. We then saw some splashes up towards Kellett Bluff and this turned out to be the J19s who were porpoising southeast in a loose group. A little behind and offshore of them, J42 and J53 passed us on the backlit side heading southeast at a medium pace. We decided to call it since we weren’t seeing any more whales that weren’t already to the south of us. As we were heading slowly in, one last group over a mile behind us to the northwest caught our eye. We decided to see who they were too and it ended up being all three of the L54s traveling together. L108 had finally appeared so we got a few rights on him, his mom, and younger brother as they headed south off Smugglers Cove in a tight group. L108 broke off and moved inshore a little while L88 showed up again and joined L54 and L117. This group of three were traveling due south, tight together about a mile offshore of CWR. J26 and J45 were traveling together about a quarter to a half mile off the reef and L108 was traveling south by himself between the two small groups. We ended the encounter at 1705 a little over a mile offshore of CWR with L54, L117, and L88 still in a tight group heading south.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-47-2

They departed Victoria at 0745 and were seeing distant eastbound dorsal fins just west of the VH buoy shortly after passing Ogden Point.
Even from a distance Mark was confident the animals were residents, and this was soon confirmed as the guys slowed and captured a few shots of J40 and J45, followed closely by the rest of J pod.
All of J pod but the J17s were travelling slowly in a tight formation – the J17s were lagging just behind and offshore – but it was a trailing group of four that caught Mark and Joe’s attention, as they spotted the hulking L88 and his adoptive family, the L54s, pacing the Js east. These four whales were the only J Clan animals missing from the CWR’s recent encounters with them off San Juan Island in late May (see Encounter #44). Mark and Joe spent a few minutes photographing each of them, and watched as the matriline passed as close to Victoria as they’ve likely been in a few years, just a mile south of the Ogden Point breakwater.
The entire group accelerated as they slipped out of the opposing ebb current south of Brotchie Ledge. They took the near-shore back eddy toward Clover Point, fanning out as they advanced, the J16s charging to the lead. As they reached Clover Point, J16 and J42 surged ahead of the rest and angled offshore, though – perhaps in an attempt to flush any lurking fish off the wall of Clover Point – most of the whales passed through the kelp beds along the southwest shore of the point. No predation was observed, but many of the Js lingered in Ross Bay for a few minutes, somewhat surface active, as the L54s caught up and briefly overtook them, slightly offshore.
As the animals meandered indecisively toward Trial Island, J16 and J42 remained in the lead, but dawdled as they waited for the remainder of the J16s to join them before being the first whales to round Staines Point. The others followed in short order, quite surface active as they moved southeast out of the bay and through the kelp bed along the southwest shore of Trial Island.
The guys ended the encounter as the animals continued east, toward Sea Bird Point, and ultimately San Juan Island. They were travelling in much the same composition they were found, with the J16s leading the bulk of J pod east, the J17s the lone matriline apart from the rest, and the L54s shadowing them all, slightly behind and offshore.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-47

Once we gathered the team and met at Snug Harbor, we left on KCB3 at 1005. The Wild Orca crew got out before we did and found the whales about four miles south of Eagle Point so we headed that direction. We arrived on scene at 1035 in that same area to find J and K pods in several large groups pointed northeast towards San Juan Island. The groups may have been mixed when we arrived but seemed to be breaking up. We had the K12s and K13s in a group to the northwest of us while a mixed group of J pod and the K3s were to the southeast of us. A couple of smaller groups of J pod passed underneath us as they traveled northeast towards SJI. J and K pod members soon began gathering in their respective pods with J pod moving almost a half mile to the southeast of K pod.

We stuck with K pod since we had seen less of them in 2024. They took a slightly more northerly track than before and were in a tight, resting formation. We got some good lefts and rights on K pod along with a couple of drone flights before we thought we would move on to J pod who was now about a quarter mile to the southeast of K pod. We moved behind K pod and over to J pod and got a few photos before J pod decided to switch positions with K pod. After a long dive, J pod came up another quarter mile to the southwest of K pod. J pod was still heading north in a single group and began passing K pod up on the outside. It was more convenient to stay with K pod so we got some more photos and a couple more drone flights in. At around 1225, and about a half mile offshore of Eagle Point, K pod angled inshore and began spreading out. At this point, we felt like we had K pod good enough for the time being and decided to give J pod another try. J pod was about a mile offshore of Eagle Point still heading slowly up island. They were in a fairly tight group although a little more stretched out than K pod had been. We made sure we had pictures of everyone before ending the encounter at 1256 with J pod about a mile northwest of Eagle Point. Upon examining our photos after we got home, we realized that K37 had got some new scarring on his dorsal fin since we had last seen him on May 27th. It was just some light tooth rakes but it might result in a small nick or an uneven trailing edge.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-46

It was a nice day, and the whales were too close to ignore so we headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1210. Barely five minutes later we were on scene off the south end of Kellett Bluff and the encounter started around 1215. The whales had not been identified yet but two whales with biggish dorsal fins went down on a long dive off the bluff as we arrived. While waiting for these two whales to resurface, we spotted another group of whales about a half mile to the southwest of us. The two whales we were waiting for eventually came back up again and they turned out to be the brothers T49A2 and T49A3. These two were loosely spread out and pointed north and we grabbed a couple of quick sun-glary rights of them before we moved to the other group offshore. This group was the rest of the T49As (minus T49A1, who was not present) along with T19 and T19B again. This pairing of groups has spent a lot of time in the San Juan Islands during the Spring of 2024. The group was in a mostly tight formation and was heading north about a half mile west of the south end of Kellett Bluff.

Early reports suggested that it probably more than just J pod. The team met at Snug Harbor and left in “KCB3” at 1048. Since the latest reports put the leaders at Discovery, we headed down Haro Strait toward False Bay expecting them to be coming across. We made it to False Bay without seeing anything before heading south offshore of Eagle Point. We were still not seeing anything, and the sighting conditions were good. We figured the whales hadn’t made it across yet so we headed west towards Seabird Point. A freighter had made the turn up Haro around Beaumont Shoal and, as we approached the area, we began to see splashes. We had finally KWs and they were riding the stern wake of the freighter. The encounter began at 1130 near Beaumont Shoal.

The group riding the wake were the leaders and soon broke off and started heading up Haro at high speed. We could see other whales behind the leaders. The lead group was the J19s and they porpoised away heading north on a line towards Andrews Bay. Behind them was a loose group of all the J17s plus J56 on the same line. To the south of this group, we could see more spread out whales which turned out to be the rest of J pod. However, even further to the south, we could see two other large groups that had to be other SRs. We quickly, and rather impatiently, made sure we got a photo of every member of J pod before heading south to a large group. This group turned out to be all of K pod in a tight group heading slowly northeast on a line towards Hannah Heights. We made sure we got some good right and lefts on everybody and then launched the drone. We got three flights in and got a solid forty minutes of the whales mostly in a resting formation. Towards the end of our time with K pod, they began milling a little offshore of False Bay. There was a little splashing and K16 spyhopped. At one point the K12s drifted away from the others and were floating around briefly. K33 had kelp draped across his back. A few of the K12s moved south towards Eagle Point. After a bit, we decided to head that direction to see who ended up down there. 

We could see a whale or two at Eagle Point but we weren’t sure who they would turn out to be. We passed K37 heading south nearshore about hallway between the south end of False Bay and Eagle Point. We found several spread out whales foraging near Eagle Point, including a mom/calf pair that turned out to be L119 and L126! Then, L77 swam by us and then L22 showed up. K37 was seen briefly heading south right off the bluff at Eagle Point. L121 and L127 also showed up and were playing around with one another. L94 appeared inshore of us and L124 made an appearance to the east of us. We were kinda hoping we just had the L12s and, therefore, just a few more whales to find. However, chance proof-of-presence photos taken of a couple of distant whales showed L82 and L91. So now we knew we had the 18 Ls along with the L12s out there somewhere. Our whales near Eagle Point dissipated on us but we saw a pair of socializing whales a little to the north. They were floating around being tactile so it took us a moment to figure out who they were. It ended up being the sprouter L110 and L122. L110 laid at the surface briefly and showed us his healed torn lip that he has had since he was a calf. We were not seeing any other whales close to shore, so we headed offshore of Eagle Point. We found the L86s spread out, out there. L90 was also in the area. The L86s were milling but other whales appeared to be heading westerly. L110 and L122 showed up again, this time traveling with their moms L83 and L91 heading southwest. The L94s (minus L113) and L22 were a little ways to the southeast and paralleling their course. The L77s were also in the area although they never hooked up with the other L12s while we were with them. We spent a little time getting photos on the L11s while another group appeared about a half mile to the east-northeast of us. This turned out to be the L72s, L115, and, somehow, the L91s again. At this point, all whales were heading southwest. More whales were appearing and they were spread out north to south with several spread out groups with tight centers and peripheral individuals. We passed the L82s and L103s on the way to a group that we thought might have whales we hadn’t seen yet in it. We then found L25, L113, L87, and they had joined up with the rest of the L94s and L22. Beyond them, to the southwest, we found L55, L109, and L118 which were the last of the whales we were expecting to find. We ended the encounter at 1655 about five miles southeast of Seabird Point with all of the L pod members present heading slowly southwest. We were confident that the L54s and L88 were not in Haro Strait today. Of the rest of L pod, the only whale we could not find was L85. Since L pod were spread out for most of the day, there is still a chance he will show up later so we won’t have anymore to say about him until we have more encounters with the L12s and a complete census of the population. L85 was looking a little thin in August of 2023 but he was still alive in November.

We passed Hein Bank on the east side and continued south a little further before stopping to take another scan. Still nothing. J pod (probably) must have headed west quicker than we thought.

It was a group of four whales that we quickly realized were not southern residents but a group of Bigg’s known as the T73As. This group is not overly common in the area although they have made their appearances over the years. T73A was in Dave’s very first ever Bigg’s encounter in May of 1990. The T73As were in a tight group heading slowly west into a bit of tidal lump. They loosened up a little with two whales traveling slightly behind the other two briefly before becoming a mostly tight group again. The T73As were being cooperative but the tidal lump made photography difficult. We ended the encounter at 1317 about a mile and a half west of where we started. While we with the T73As, J pod was found heading west on Constance Bank. Given the westerly seas, we decided to not try to catch up to them.

The group was reported to include the T146s along with T125A and T128. The T146s are a group that does not show up in the area very often so we were eager to see them. T125A and T128 are a pair of probable brothers who were also rare in the area prior to 2015. Since then, however, they have become quite common visitors in the Spring. Other whales were thought to be present too. The water that day was not very nice and the sky was mostly gray but at least it wasn’t raining as we headed out. 

We arrived on scene about mid-strait off of Lime Kiln at 1120. The whales were in a single loose group as they headed north up Haro Strait. T125A and T128 were obvious, as well as a large sprouter and an adult female that we took to be members of the T146s. The sprouter had a slighter smaller sprouter traveling near him. After a couple of looks we were able identify the smaller sprouter as T65B1 and his mother T65B was there too. With the T65Bs here, it made for a group of ten whales. We were able to get good left and right side passes on them although the conditions were challenging and it was easy to bounce the whales out of the camera frame. Around 1130, another group of whales was spotted almost a mile to the northwest. They were heading southeast when first seen. A few minutes later, we decided to go over and see if we could get a few pictures of them. We headed toward the new group which had been reported to be the T49As along with T19 and T19B. The group we had been with also angled that direction. By the time we got to the T19s and T49As (minus T49A1 and A2), they were charging north about a third of a mile ahead of the other group. The whales were in a fairly sloppy section of water and we only managed to get photos on a few of them before they went down on a long dive. We moved a little ahead to wait for the lead group in a calmer bit of water but they never materialized. The trailing, original group came up again on a line heading directly toward Kelp Reef. When the T19s and T49As finally reappeared, they had turned around and shown up almost a mile to the southwest of us in much sloppier seas. It was not worth bouncing back that direction for a group of whales we had had several times already this Spring so we went back to the original group of the T65Bs, T146s, T125A, and T128. We were able to get some more right sides but we were being slopped around in the trough with both spray and whale blow covering our camera lenses. At about 1215, the whales turned westerly right through all the rocks just south of the Kelp Reef marker.

The next group we came across was J16, J26, J44, J45, and J49. J44. J45, and J49 moved off to the east but J16 and J26 moved nearer to some other whales to our northwest. J46 passed through the groups and continued north but J16 and J26 acquired J40 and J42. This group briefly merged with the J31s and J27 before there were two instances of some somewhat confused milling. It looked like there was a disagreement on direction but the whales who wanted to go north, won, and the whales continued north. The J31s, J27, and J40 fell behind the J16s as they headed slowly north just a little east of D’Arcy Island.
We weren’t seeing many other whales on the Canadian side of the strait so we began crossing back across hoping to find some of the whales we hadn’t seen yet. We found J39 again, still cruising north by himself mid-strait off of Battleship. The last two whales we found before we called it quits were J47 and J53 traveling together as they headed quickly north, west of the west end of Spieden island. We ended the encounter with these two at 1555.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-40

We arrived on scene with a group of whales about a mile north of the Beaumont Shoal buoy at 1254. T19, T19B, and the T49As (minus T49A2) were in a single, tight group heading slowly north. The brothers T49A3 and T49A4 were surfacing together towards the rear of the formation. We stayed for one right side pass on this group before leaving them for another group that was spotted almost a mile to the southeast.

The new group was the T36As and they were now heading north-northeast towards San Juan Island. We had one pass to get a few left side IDs and then decided to launch the drone. It was mostly a drone encounter for the rest of the day as the T36As headed slowly up the west side of San Juan Island. The T19s and T49A group had continued north on the Canadian side of Haro Strait and we soon lost sight of them. The group of six T36As split into two in Andrews Bay with T36A1 and T36A1A being at least a hundred yards or more to the inside of the rest of the T36As. The widest spread between the groups was off Kellett Bluff with the T36A1s being several hundred yards inshore of the others. Then the two groups switched positions off north Henry Island and the T36A1s took the offshore line. By the time the whales made it to Battleship, the T36A1s were heading back east. It looked like some of the whales may have gone through the slot between Battleship and McCracken Point on the north tip of Henry Island but at least one whale went around the top of Battleship. The six whales came back together and were traveling east off the west entrance to Roche Harbor. From the drone footage, the T36As appeared to be slightly more social now than they had earlier in the day. Also, while we knew at least one of the young T36As was a male, we were able to confirm from drone footage that both T36A5 and T36A1A are males. We had one last right side photo-ID pass before ending the encounter at 1543 just north of the east entrance to Roche Harbor.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-39

Though he managed to catch a glimpse of a fin or two in the distance, the whales soon veered around the southeastern edge of the Chain Islands, disappearing from his view. In the midst of their conversation, a second report chimed in, detailing that another group of whales was approaching Race Rocks from the west, so the decision was made to rendezvous with Brendon at the boat and aim to depart the dock shortly after 1130. They chose to head east first towards the group of whales near Discovery Island before planning to conduct a search for the western whales on their return journey to Victoria.

By 1215, Mark's keen eyes spotted the first dorsal fin, approximately half a nautical mile northeast of their current position off Seabird Point. Among the whales – and first to be photographed – was the distinctive T086A3, accompanied by her first calf, T086A3A. Together, they were travelling with the three members of the T071Bs. This marked a total count of five whales, all of which were moving in a tight-knit group. The backdrop of eastern Haro Strait was adorned with the colourful sails of a sailing race, which added to the scene. 

Based on the timeline of their travels and the behaviour as Mike 1 began the encounter, it appeared that they had just finished a meal. Despite the 2-knot ebb pushing against them, the whales persisted on a northward trajectory albeit at a more leisurely pace of 3-knots. It was noted that throughout the encounter dive times averaged 3-4 minutes. Lighting conditions were opportune for both lefts and rights, so the team quickly worked to collect updated photographs of the five animals. 

As the whales continued to move northwest towards Ten Mile Point and the afternoon sun reaching its peak above, Mark and Brendon called the encounter to a close at 1313.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-37

As they crossed over the southwestern edge of Constance Bank at 1339, Brendon turned his sights to the south just in time to see the dorsal fin of a large bull slip below the surface. Moments later, two smaller fins emerged, slicing through the water several hundred metres apart, both on an eastbound course. The male rose again in a high-arch, revealing his identity immediately as 22-year-old T100C. As the remaining whales surfaced once more, it was clear that the team had located the T100s, minus T100E, which they had recently encountered two days prior on April 11th near the Victoria waterfront (see encounter #35). 

As the Mike 1crew maintained pace alongside the whales, the intensity of the sunlight from the south created unfavorable conditions for capturing photographs from the left side. Recognizing this challenge, they decided to pause momentarily, leaving the whales to move ahead, before resuming from a new viewpoint. They then adjusted their course slightly to the southeast, ensuring better lighting conditions for capturing optimal photographs from the whales' right sides.

The three animals were facing a 2-knot ebb but continued to forge ahead at a steady pace of 4 to 5 knots. While T100 and T100F gained ground against the ebbing current, T100C slowly fell behind, momentarily pausing as if something caught his interest. After a brief stop and investigation, T100C corrected his course and swiftly caught up to the others, who had altered their trajectory to the northeast, and were now traversing over Constance Bank.

Mark and Brendon decided to conclude the encounter at 1427, watching as the three tightly-grouped whales continued east along a tide line.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-38

Shortly after at 1623, the large and unmistakable dorsal fin of T087 appeared a mile ahead moving westward. Mark slowed the vessel and eased forward to parallel the bull’s right-side in order to make the most of the lighting conditions. As the team focused on T087, who was travelling at a leisurely pace, additional dorsal fins began to emerge, spreading out to the south of their position. Mark and Brendon managed to snap some left-side photographs of the bull before bidding farewell to him at 1645 to proceed to confirm the rest of the group.

The overall pace of these whales was notably slower compared to the T100s, averaging around 4.5 knots. Brendon identified the first two whales as T099B and T124D1, followed by a pair shadowing them identified as T124D & T124D3. To the south, Mark spotted four more whales later identified as the remaining members of the T099s. In total, along with T087, they counted nine Bigg’s killer whales. All whales maintained a westbound trajectory, with consistent dive times of 3-4 minutes, followed by an average of 4 surfacings.

Once all individuals were photographed the Mike 1 crew wrapped up their encounter at 1724, ~ 6 nm north north east of Port Angeles, setting course for Victoria to the north.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-36

They left the dock at Victoria's harbour at ~ 1445 and strategically opted to head towards the northernmost group first, which had been last reported south west of Hein Bank and moving quickly. At 1519, the first group of whales, identified as the T100s minus T100E, came into view ~ 5 nm south southeast of Discovery Island, and the encounter commenced. The T100s are a group of whales that are most often sighted in South east Alaskan waters, which made this an excellent opportunity to capture updated photographs of them.

The matriarch, T100, and her eldest, T100C, were travelling together approximately 250 metres from the youngest, T100F. While both T100 and T100C surfaced regularly and predictably, T100F's surfacings were notably sporadic, often taking on a more unpredictable pattern compared to the other two whales. However, all members of the group were moving swiftly at a pace of 7-8 knots for the majority of the encounter, markedly bypassing multiple opportunities to hunt the abundant harbour porpoises in the area. It was speculated that perhaps their rapid movement might have been in response to the presence of Jpod, which had been spotted to the east earlier in the day, heading in their direction.

Following successful photographs from various angles of the three whales, Mark and Brendon made the decision to conclude the encounter at 1604. Mark then directed the vessel southward, setting sights on a larger aggregation of Bigg’s killer whales further south.

Additional note: at 1745, roughly 1 nautical mile south of the VH Buoy, Mark and Brendon encountered the T100s again as the team made way for Victoria. They observed the trio closely grouped together, traveling in a southwest direction, seemingly on a direct course for Race Rocks.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-35

There was also a nice group of Bigg’s off the south end of San Juan Island. We decided to go out and look for the SRs and maybe see the Bigg’s on the way. The team met at Snug Harbor and left in KCB3 at 1055 with a quick trip to the Roche Harbor fuel dock on the way.

The Bigg’s were the T36As and T49As and we arrived on scene as they were off American Camp around 1152. The group was loosely spread out in singles, pairs, and maybe a threesome. They were all heading quickly east towards Cattle Point. The young males T36A3 and T49A4 were rolling around together as were T36A5 and T49A6 nearby. We believe T36A5 is a male after he rolled over, exposing his sea snake. The young females T36A2 and T49A5 were also traveling together slightly behind the mom whales who were traveling together in the lead with one or two of their littlest ones bouncing around. T49A1 was ever so slightly at the rear of the group but was still a part of it. T49A2 and T49A3 had been reported to be in the area but had separated from the rest of the group and we never saw them. After a pretty quick pass on the T36As and T49As where we got some right sides, we decided we needed to leave and go look for the SRs as there had been no reports of them since the initial one.

We first headed southwest towards Hein Bank. Once we had hit the bank and stopped to take a scan, we turned southeast on a line to somewhere to the right of Smith Island. We went in this direction for about ten minutes or so before stopping to take another scan. Michael spotted a distant fin to the west-southwest of us so we headed that direction and the encounter started around 1300 somewhere in the vicinity of the VA buoy. 
J pod was trending very slowly to the west and was spread out south to north in multiple groups. The southernmost group was the largest and included the J14s (minus J49), J22s, J31s, J35s,along with J36, J46, and J53. J44 and J49 were rolling around together a few hundred yards to the north of the larger group. The rest of the J16s looked like they were another few hundred yards north of J44 and J49. And yet another couple of males could be seen even further to the northeast of them. We got what ID shorts we could of the whales and also got the new drone up for several flights over them. Some of the large south group moved off to the north but, eventually, all the groups started to merge. All the whales were moving slowly and doing some milling, sometimes stalling out. The J16s joined the larger group and then so did the J19s and J39. J27 had to come from the farthest away but he had joined all the rest of J pod by about 1445.

He and Brendon mobilized Mike 1 and departed Victoria harbour an hour later and were on route to Discovery Island when George, while fishing in Haro Strait, called to relay that he had eyes on a separate group of northbound whales northeast of Ten Mile Point. By this time, Joe had arrived on a commercial whale watch boat with the ones that were previously spotted at Constance Bank, and confirmed them as the T100's (less T100E) along with T101A and T101B, so the Mike 1 crew headed to the new, unidentified group. 
The encounter began at 1207 when Mark spotted the first dorsal fin half a mile ahead at the northern end of Johnstone Reef. A short few minutes later, more fins began to appear along the reef in a tighter group. The first whales to surface were the T036As, who have been keeping a presence in the Salish Sea over the last few weeks and were last encountered by the CWR a little over two weeks ago (see Encounter #22). Moments later, a large bull surfaced a few paces behind the main group and Brendon immediately recognized him as 43-year-old T051. 

T051 was trapped alongside another male, T049A2, in Barnes Lake, Alaska, for ~6 weeks in the summer of 2023. While T049A2 has been encountered numerous times since, this sighting marks the first encounter with T051 since fellow researchers helped to coax the two bulls out of the lake at high-tide.

All the whales were traveling due northward in Haro Strait at 4-5 knots, with T036A and her eldest daughter, T036A1, leading. The four youngest whales in the group, T036A2, T036A3, T036A5, and T036A1A, were especially animated throughout the encounter, showcasing several inverted leaps, aerial scans, and sexually playful behavior. T051 remained steadfastly behind, and at times parallel, to the main group throughout the encounter, and looked to be in good health.

The T124As had headed up Upright Channel and were just outside the mouth of East Sound on Orcas Island when we arrived on scene at about 1415.

The T124As were milling and feeding in the area with quite a large spread initially. We got the drone up over some of them as they fed bits of harbor seal. All of the T124As came back together near Twin Rocks but continued feeding and milling as they made their way slowly up East Sound in a loose group. There was a lot of rolling and tail waves going on with the younger animals. The young calf that had been traveling with T124A1 on our last encounter with the T124As was now traveling exclusively with T124A4.

There was a slight southerly lump from the current as they slowly pushed south, but spotting conditions were decent.

As they slowed down towards Middle Bank, Mark discussed taking one final scan before heading for the harbour. Just as soon, Rachelle called out ""There is a fin!"" They both glimpsed a large bull on the next and last surfacing, pointed east a half mile south of Mike 1's position.

While scanning around for a couple of minutes in order to reacquire him, Rachelle spotted a smaller fin a half mile to the north east. Once more, both Mark and Rachelle saw its next and last surfacing before seeing nothing for close to 20 minutes, while scanning in all directions. They decided to head east towards North Hein Bank thinking that perhaps they had missed a sequence by looking down the trailing edges of their dorsal fins. 

When approximately 4.5 nm east of the initial sighting, which was now close to an hour previous, they decided to push back towards the initial location. Mark then received a call from George relaying that he saw a bull and a cow from the lookout at Ten Mile Point, and the two whales were moving quickly north towards Kelp Reef.

Mark spotted the pair ahead of them once they were ~ 3 nm southeast of Kelp Reef and shouted out it's ""Chainsaw!""

He and Rachelle were both surprised as they expected to see T049A1 and his younger brother T049A2. The earlier sighting was too distant to see the distinctive notches of T063 ""Chainsaw"" but that is who they were both convinced were the two illusive animals at Middle Bank.
As it would turn out, brothers T049A1 and T049A2 were picked up with the rest of the T049As in Boundary Pass so obviously it couldn't have been them!
They tracked T063 and his mom, T065 for the next 29 minutes as they moved along at a steady 7.5 knots.
Mark felt there were likely others ahead of the pair as they were cruising along with a purpose. Sure enough, one of the commercial whale watch boats spotted at least two individuals off the south end of Henry Island!

Described as a pair of killer whales, It was thought that it could be T049A1 and his younger brother, T049A2, who were in Esquimalt Harbour for most of the day before. As they were leaving the harbour, Mark received another report that a single bull had been seen inside Victoria harbour's Ogden Point breakwater at ~0900. Just as the Mike 1 crew was about to have a binocular scan from the mouth of the harbour, George spotted a single bull moving quickly east through Enterprise Channel from his perch on Gonzales lookout. 

Mike 1 rounded the corner of the Oak Bay golf course at 1003 and Mark spotted the trailing edge of a bull killer whale moving north towards Baynes Channel. When he got alongside within 300 metres, he was able to confirm the unmistakable fin of 46-year old T011A.
Following his last sighting in September of 2023 in the Salish Sea, T011A resurfaced on March 12th in the Sooke Basin - notably returning with five total appearances in the basin between the 12th and 31st of the month. He had returned with a new minor injury at the leading edge of the top of his dorsal giving it a slight kink to to his left side.

For the next 35 minutes Mark and Rachelle watched T011A track north, rounding Ten Mile Point light and cruising up the Vancouver Island coastline at a steady 5.5 knots with no signs of predation.

They picked up their pace as they made their way along the southwest coast of Vancouver Island, and arrived with the animals at 1620.
The group of four whales had been making good way east in the building flood current, and the Mike 1 team were quickly able to identify them as the T030Bs! The T030Bs are not overly common visitors to the Salish Sea, though Mark did encounter them in late January when CWR first observed the newest addition to the family, T030B3 (see Encounter #09). They have now been observed in the area in March in five of the last six years. Typically present in encounters with the T030Bs are the T117Bs, an adult female and her two-year-old offspring. The duo soon made themselves known, appearing just under a quarter mile to the southwest. Mark manoeuvred Mike 1 that way, and the guys were able to confirm their identity. T117B welcomed her first known calf into the group in early 2023, and the CWR team has been happy to see how healthy the pair look; the youngster could pass for a three year old!
The T117Bs were closing the gap to the rest quickly, as the T030Bs had momentarily stalled out and begun milling, perhaps to chase some prey. No prey sharing was observed however, and if they were successful, the animals certainly made short work of the small meal.
As the whales converged and resumed their easterly travel, they collected a quick sequence of right-side identification shots before ending the encounter at 1644, leaving the group steaming east. 
Of note, Mark and Joe independently observed two other members of the recently-rare extended matriline, T030A and T030C, north bound in Haro Strait early last week while guiding commercial whale watch trips.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-26

They quickly geared up and headed to the dock, leaving Snug at 1218. After a quick transit through Mosquito Pass, they arrived on scene at the east end of Spieden Channel at 1235.

When they arrived, the whales were in two main groups. The bulk of the T49As, along with T18, T19, and T19B were milling in one group, having apparently separated a sea lion from the rocks. T19C and T49A1 milled a bit to the west, apparently socializing. Meanwhile, T49A2 was in the middle of the channel, apparently just milling on his own.

The team got a few shots of T49A1 and T19C, and then slowly worked their way closer to the main group. As they approached, the sea lion hunt apparently ended. T19B did several large breaches as the whales began to trend west again, getting closer to T19C and T49A1. The team stuck with them for a bit, getting everyone on camera, before moving off.

After one more quick pass on T49A1 and T19C, the team went looking for T49A2. They found him a few hundred yards off everyone else to the southwest. He was milling slowly, generally trending back towards the main group. The team took two passes on him to get ID photos before he took a long dive. When he next popped up, T49A2 was further back towards the northeast, in the direction of the rest of the whales. The team ended the encounter off Davidson Head at 1325 and headed to the fuel dock.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/25-2024

He and Fin departed Victoria harbour on Mike 1 at 1030 and headed southwest toward Race Rocks. Stopping to scan several times along the way, he spotted colleagues on a Fisheries and Oceans survey vessel transiting northeast in the Strait, south of Sooke. They reported that the only cetaceans they had seen were porpoise so Mark turned to the south and then east toward Dungeness. There was a 1000 report of four killer whales that had been reported near Port Townsend that were heading out of Admiralty Inlet which he felt could be nearing Eastern Bank or Dungeness by the time he got into the area.
Upon reaching Dungeness Spit at ~1300, Mark received a delayed report of westbound killer whales near Diamond Point, which was less than 9nm south-south east of his location. While scanning with his binoculars he received confirmation from Captain Carl that he had his eyes on them, close to the shore near Sequim, from his 24' perch aboard the Island Explorer 5. Carl was soon able to confirm that they were prey-sharing, with a large group of gulls hovering above them as they milled.
Mike 1 arrived ten minutes later and confirmed it was a group of seven animals, the T046Bs. They were now moving at a steady pace towards the southwest corner of Protection Island. They skirted the southern shoreline of Protection Island, passing the hauled out harbor seals that were safe from their grasp. 
When the T046Bs reached the southeast corner of the island they veered to the south and fanned out as they entered the mouth of Discovery Bay.
Mark was able to get decent shots of T046B2s newest calf which he had first observed while guiding a commercial whale watch trip four months ago on November 25th westbound amongst a bunch of feeding humpbacks near Crescent Bay. He next encountered them a few days later on Mike 1/ CWR on November 29th traveling southwest south of Sooke (see 2023 Encounter #71). The calf was estimated to be born mid November as there was no sign of a calf with T046B2 during the previous encounter on October 25th and when photographed in late November, fetal folds were still visible.
Mark stayed with them long enough to get proof of presence photographs of each animal before ending the encounter at 1447 at Beckett Point. They were doing long dives and seemed determined to head south to the head of the bay.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/24-2024

We headed down to the house to see if we could see anything from the porch. There were already whales in front of the house heading north when we got there. The whales were very spread out with most of the whales mid-strait or further west. J51 and J58 were the eastern most whales and they passed by about a half mile west of the reef. J40 breached a couple times mid-strait and she was followed by J45 breaching twice too. J45’s growing pec fins were obvious even from such a distance. The J31’s were also out there near J40 and J45. It was a gray and slightly breezy day but we decided to go out in the boat anyway. We contacted Katie and we all met at Snug Harbor before leaving in KCB3 at 1154. We saw whales almost immediately offshore of Mitchell Bay and the encounter started at 1159.
The first whales were a few random spread out whales heading north about mid-strait. J40, J42, J46, and J53 were all in the area. We saw J27 briefly after them. After J27, we found J39 a little to the east of Halibut Island. J47 was a little east of him. We saw some more whales to the northwest and found J19, J22, the J31s, along with J37 and J59 loosely spread. All these whales came together in a tight group and began porpoising past Tom Pt. on Gooch Island. A little past Gooch Island, these whales slowed down and a few of the whales began milling like they were doing a slow fish chase. We then found a few more spread out individuals as the whales approached the south end of Swanson Channel including the J41s, J39, J42, and J47 again, and J38 who was milling by himself. A few other whales, including J45, were farther west and closer to the Moresby Island shoreline.

At 1440, they set off towards Race Rocks to search for the inbound whales, while also on the lookout for a lone male who had been reported south west bound along Victoria’s waterfront. 

Upon the arrival of the Mike 1 team at the eastern edge of Race Passage, multiple blows were observed to the west. The encounter officially commenced at 1516 with a group of six whales, identified as the T036As, who were proceeding eastbound towards Constance Bank against the ebb. Shortly after the team arrived, the whales stalled out and a brief moment of socialization ensued, during which time T036A1A spyhopped. 

The whales proceeded eastward at a leisurely pace, exhibiting variable down times ranging from 4 ½ to 9 minutes. As the whales ventured approximately 0.8 nautical miles east of Race Rocks, their movements became more erratic, marked by frequent directional changes towards the south and then westward again, suggesting that they may have been investigating potential prey sources. However, after brief intervals, they resumed their eastward trajectory. Notably, the two youngest members of the group – T036A5 & T036A1A – were observed frequently swimming upside-down and along their sides throughout the encounter, further indicating a lack of urgency while battling against the tide.

The encounter was concluded at 1643 as the whales passed by a bait ball and turned slightly to the southeast. En route back to Victoria, the team remained vigilant for the lone bull reported earlier in the day, but were unsuccessful in acquiring any visual.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/22-2024

It was a beautiful day, and the whales were heading towards us for the time being, so we loaded up our gear and headed down to Snug Harbor. We left Snug in KCB3 at 1440 and headed toward Discovery. We found Mark in his yellow boat and the whales about a mile east of the Beaumont Shoal buoy and the encounter began at 1507. 
The whales were in a fairly tight group and were now generally heading east-southeast. T87 was at the rear of the group while still being a part of it. The other whales present were T46C2, the T46B1s, and the T124As minus the T124A2s. T124A1 had a new calf with her that we had heard had been first seen the week before. We only had good lighting for right sides so we spent some time getting those on everyone in the group, including the calf. The calf was not showing a lot of eye patch and was often hidden behind T124A1’s dorsal fin but we got what we needed on it. Once we were happy with our right side IDs, we decided to launch the drone for some behavioral data. Once the drone was up, one of the first things that was noticed was that the calf was trying to nurse but T124A1 kept rolling away from it. Whenever the calf made an attempt, T124A1 would do a little spin with the calf chasing the mammary slits around. By the second launch, the whales had split into two groups with T87, T46C2, the T46B1s, and the T124A1s a few hundred yards to the southwest of the rest of the T124As. On at least one occasion on the second flight, T124A1 did not roll, and the calf was able to make a more normal attempt to nurse.

They mobilized Mike 1 and departed Victoria just after 1430. As they arrived with the whales near the VG buoy, four whales surfaced, angling toward the Victoria waterfront. Mark and Joe rattled off a few quick shots, confirming the presence of T046B1 and her offspring, along with T046C2, for a total of four whales. The whales dove in unison, and next surfaced well north after a 7 or 8-minute dive. A bit of a wanderer, T046C2 has spent much of the last year or more in the company of T046B1, T046B1A and T046B1C, or occasionally with related matrilines such as the T046Bs and T123s. The team spent the next hour shadowing the whales from a little over a half mile, observing several prolonged sounding dives nearing nine minutes and multiple direction changes. The animals appeared several times to be foraging, particularly in strong tidelines offshore of Albert Head, but no obvious predation was observed. T046C2 was observed surfacing with what appeared to me flesh in her jaws early in the encounter, so it is possible the foursome had nabbed a meal prior to Mike 1 arriving. After about an hour of this sustained long-dive, zig-zag travel pattern, the Mike 1 crew approached to collect right-side ID shots of all four and ended the encounter. They left the whales a mile or so west of Constance Bank, split up; T046C2 was on her own and travelling east approximately 0.75 nautical miles north of the T046B1 trio, who were angling more to the southeast.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/20-2024

Thanks to the recent switch in daylight savings time, and the report which indicated the whales were moving at a leisurely pace, there was time to ready Mike 1 and set out for an early evening encounter. Setting out shortly after 1600, Mark, Fin and Brendon charted a course southwestward into the expansive waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, opting to run along the shoreline before venturing offshore. At 1649, Brendon caught sight of a single dorsal fin to the southwest, signaling the commencement of their encounter approximately 1.5 nm southwest of Secretary Island. The fin was determined to belong to L108, a member of the lesser-seen L54 matriline. As the team approached, L108 carefully pursued a salmon which lasted only a brief time before resuming a course northwestward closer to shore. Not long after, Mark noticed another whale shadowing L108’s position some distance to the south. Mark repositioned the vessel and the team captured a set of photos, revealing the identity of the whale as L91. Unlike L108’s more leisurely pace, L91 was forging west with greater intent. As L91 slipped past, the team paused for a thorough scan. When the scan did not yield more whales, the team decided to push northwestward along the tracks of L108, hopefully leading to more whales. After several minutes on this course, and no sign of additional whales, they turned to the southwest in case the leaders had pushed offshore. Once more, no whales appeared. Mark and Brendon then considered that the two whales they’d seen earlier, both of whom represented separate matrilines, were perhaps neither leaders nor trailers and the rest of the pod might have stalled out many miles to the south, so Mark steered Mike 1 to the southeast. True to their persistence, several minutes later, Mark's keen eyes spotted a large bull to the south. The team approached slowly and identified the bull as 31-year old L88. As they observed L88's movements, another fin caught Mark's attention off the port quarter. Brendon recognized the whale as L90, actively in pursuit of a salmon. For several minutes, she gave chase, twisting and turning in pursuit, until another whale, L125, joined in. While L90 continued to remain nearby, she relinquished her pursuit of the salmon to give way to L125, indicating a potential training opportunity for the 3-year-old whale. Beyond L90 and L125, two more blows appeared to the south. These whales turned out to be L125’s mother, L86, and her older brother, L106. After taking photos of their right sides, the team stopped and had one final scan in the hopes of locating additional members of the pod. While they could not see more whales in the area, they both took note of L88 splashing north of their position so they decided to investigate. As it would turn out, L88 had also found a salmon! This marked three salmon pursuits in a single encounter, which was a welcomed winter sight. Mike 1 remained with L88 for a few minutes until he had successfully captured the salmon. In the distance, L125 began to breach. With daylight waning, and an hour’s drive ahead of them, Mark and Brendon called the encounter to a close at 1849, watching as L88 continued west into the fading light with the spoils of his catch.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-19

We decided to head that way first and left in KCB3 at 1022 with a stop at the Roche Harbor fuel dock on the way. We eventually arrived on scene about halfway between Enterprise Reef and Prevost Island and the encounter began at 1130. A group of Bigg’s were just finishing up feeding on something and there looked to be some celebratory splashing going on as we were arriving. We could see and smell a large blubber oil slick behind where most of the whales were. The group included the T90s and the T124A2s-seven whales total. They grouped up and began traveling north a bit closer to the Prevost Island shoreline. We got one series of right sides of the group before getting back on their left sides. They were cooperative as they picked up a little speed while keeping a straight line and showing lots of saddle. After two series of lefts, we were happy with the photos we had and decided it was time to continue on with our whale search. We ended the encounter at 1159 with the T90s and T124A2s in a tight group heading north up Trincomali Channel across from the western entrance to Active Pass. While we were with the T90s and T124A2s, we had been hearing and seeing reports of some northern residents that had been hanging around the Howe Sound area for the last couple/few days. There had been a report of a resident sized group of whales in that area already that morning. That was over 30 miles away but neither we nor any northern residents were ever going to closer to each other this winter. And we had a nice day for it-at least in the lower Gulf Islands and lower Strait of Georgia.

The last report we had to go on was two hours old and put the whales heading east from a little north of where we were and heading east toward Bowen Island. We stopped at a spot where we could scan up the southeast side of Bowen and we also dropped the hydrophone. We didn’t see or hear anything and there was a big dark cloud with a rain squall up that way and over northwest Vancouver. We headed north to a spot where we could scan up the northwest side of Bowen and dropped the hydrophone a second time but, once again, didn’t see or hear anything. We did a loop between the little island archipelago off the west end of Bowen Island and Keats Island and stopped to scan again as far as we could see into Howe Sound. The whales had either headed deep into Howe Sound or had turned back northwest towards Sechelt. If we had brighter skies and a bit more of the afternoon left, we might have kept looking but we were a long way from home. We gave it a good try but decided we probably ought to start heading toward the fuel dock before it closed. We headed south past the Fraser outflow before angling towards East Point. It was a nice ride and the sun came out again by the time we had made it to the coal docks. We were approaching Boiling Reef when Michael spotted killer whales to the east of us.

He felt they were trending east although he initially thought west bound. As Mark was already down in Victoria's inner harbour and within 10 minutes of mobilizing Mike 1 and less than 30 minutes of arriving at Gord's estimate location, he decided to head out and attempt to reacquire them; at the very least he could confirm who they were with the last of the daylight.

They left the dock shortly after and charted a course southward in calm seas. A tight group of exhalations caught their attention at 1114 slightly south of their position abeam of Albert Head, marking the commencement of the encounter. Brendon identified the whales as the T041s, T109Bs and T002B. This provided a total count of eight whales in light of T109B3's absence. The whales maintained a steady pace of 4 knots while in a resting formation. By 1127, the pod veered southwestward, setting a course for William Head. Over the course of the next several surfacings, their movements became more dynamic and the group began to weave between inshore and offshore waters, with dive times averaging six minutes. Prior to one of these dives, the team noticed new rake marks on T041A’s left side and T041A3’s dorsal fin. A noticeable shift in the whales’ behaviour occurred at 1235 when the group surfaced over a mile away, this time split into two distinct groups: the tightly-knit T109Bs heading south, and the more leisurely-paced T041s and T002B aiming southeast. This division persisted for several surfacing sequences; eventually, the groups reunited on a course for Race Rocks, where they arrived at 1331. Here, only two whales, T041A2 and T109B4, ventured into the reserve from the southeast corner and began to engage in close interactions with the harbor seals and Steller sea lions hauled upon the rocky outcrops. Over the course of the next few minutes, the pair of whales worked the shallows back-and-forth along the south side of the reserve. As the Mike 1 crew observed from the water, a group of Pearson College students participating in the Marine Mammals of the Salish Sea program put on by Race Rocks guardian Derek Sterling were able to experience, first hand, Bigg's hunting amongst the reefs on the south side of Great Race. Derek later told Mark that they conveniently were on the Orca component of the course when Mark called to inform him that Bigg's were approaching the south east corner of the reserve! The hunting endeavours by T041A2 and T109B4 continued for twenty minutes before they departed Race Rocks, their efforts seemingly unsuccessful. Shortly after, they began porpoising towards the other six whales who had continued southwest from the reserve. By 1350, all eight whales had regrouped and were now traversing west. Mike 1 concluded the encounter at 1407, noting that the whales were on a line for Church Rock on Vancouver Island shoreline.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-14

They had heard second hand reports that J pod may have exited Puget Sound on 05-FEB-2024, and were hoping they might find the whales somewhere in southern Haro, or on the banks. As they were gearing up, they heard reports of a single male killer whale seen from shore, moving into Haro Strait from Baynes Channel. They decided to head there first to see if they could ID the whale. As they motored, the report was updated to indicate it was actually two adult males. The team got into the area where both Mark and George Hamilton indicated the whales might be. While getting some pointers from George over the phone, Michael saw a flash of sun reflecting off something in the distance, and was able to get a fix on the two whales through binoculars, heading north further inshore on the Canadian side of the strait. Dave and Michael headed towards the whales, but they went down on another long dive. Next time the team saw them, they were 2/3 mile off shore of the team. Finally, on the next sequence, the whales surfaced just a few hundred yards to their south. The team was able to approach the whales and begin their encounter. The team quickly IDed the two males as T60D and T60E, whales that had been well documented in previous encounters. The whales briefly milled, and then continued swimming quickly to the north. As the whales approached Zero Rock, they split up, with T60D going further east while T60E passed near Zero Rock. The team stayed with the whales until the research vessel Skana was able to get on scene, and then ended their encounter at 10:40. After leaving the whales, the team went south, searching Middle and Hein Bank for signs of the residents. They didn't see any signs of more killer whales, however they did encounter a young Northern Fur Seal pup. The pup quickly swam away from the research vessel. These animals are typically found in pelagic waters off the coast, and are very uncommon in inland waters. The next day, Mark also saw a fur seal during his survey for killer whales in Juan de Fuca, but a much larger individual, meaning there are multiple fur seals in the Salish Sea at the moment.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-13

He called George to see if he was home in order to keep an eye out for them but he was conveniently already on Gonzales hill with his trusty Zeiss binoculars. Within a few minutes after he turned and looked north into Oak Bay he spotted them between Chatham Island and the Chain Islands heading south east. Mark met Brendon at Mike 1 and departed the dock at 1045. They crossed the Victoria waterfront before coming to a stop ~ 2 nm south west of Seabird Point to conduct a scan of the area where the whales had last been seen. With no visual of the reported whales, the two continued ahead along a southeast course with a moderate north wind and two foot chop on their port quarter; at 1125 Mark detected an exhalation in his peripheral vision approximately a quarter mile south of the vessel’s position, signalling the beginning of the encounter ~ 3 nm south of Discovery Island. It wasn’t until several minutes later that the whales reappeared, this time slightly north of Mike 1. Mark turned the boat into the short, now increasing waves and gradually navigated towards their position. The first animal to be photographed was T060D, a 20-year-old bull who is most frequently accompanied by his younger brother, T060E. A few seconds later, the latter also surfaced, his tell-tale notches unmistakable. Brothers T060D and T060E dispersed from their immediate family in 2019, shortly before the birth of their youngest sibling, and have since been sighted numerous times on both the northern and southern coasts of Vancouver Island. They were last encountered by CWR staff on January 7th (See Encounter #5) although Mark had seen them more recently on January 23rd with T019 and T019B near Eagle Point, San Juan Island while guiding a commercial whale watch trip. While the two bulls effortlessly navigated their way through the chop, Brendon took note of their dive times: the first two dives lasted nearly 7 minutes each, while the third-and-final dive observed were timed just under 6 minutes as they had picked up their pace and were on a more steady track line. Given the building sea conditions, and with the whales persisting on their southeastern trajectory, Mark and Brendon made the decision to conclude the encounter at 1203 and return to Victoria.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-12

Since K Pod had been observed several miles offshore, it was evident that these couldn’t be the same whales. Intrigued, the team decided to investigate. The team navigated to the reported location off Sooke and then set out westward from there. While traversing across Orveas Bay, the distinct scent of a fresh predation wafted through the air. Despite not detecting any slick, the team proceeded cautiously, staying on high alert for the whales who were surely nearby. Upon reaching Sheringham Point, the team halted for a thorough scan. It wasn't long before George spotted the whales through his binoculars, approaching Sheringham from the east. The encounter began at 1238 off Sheringham Point. The first whale to surface was T109B4, a distinctly-marked whale with a noticeable notch along its spine. Shortly after, T109B and T109B5 surfaced in unison, accompanied by another sizable female identified by Brendon as T002B, a satellite female known for moving between various pods, including the T109Bs. Coincidentally, T002B was last observed off Sooke on August 30th, 2023, also in the company of the T109Bs. Notably absent during this encounter, however, was 11-year-old female T109B3, present in the August sighting. The four whales moved leisurely, likely resting post predation. As they approached Point No Point their pace slowed to little over 1 knot, now just a few metres from the rocky shoreline. At the western tip of Point No Point the whales engaged with a patch of kelp in the shallow water; T002B emerged with kelp draping over her dorsal fin and saddle patches, while T109B lifted her rostrum twice in low-profile spyhops. After a few minutes of enjoying the kelp, the whales resumed their westward trajectory. The team decided to end the encounter here at 1324 and commence the journey back to Victoria.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-11

Mark left for the harbour, briefly stopping to pick up Brendon en route, and together they met George at the boat. The team left the dock at 0940, charting a course towards Race Rocks in the hopes of intercepting the whales before they might enter the reserve. At 1010 as they were ~ 1 nm north east of Great Race a series of fins caught their attention ~ .5 nm southwest of Race Rocks. As they approached they were highly suspicious that they were Residents by the big spread and behaviour; they could see several breaching in the distance and the closest individual was tail lobbing in a tide line. Brendon was able to confirm K pod after taking distant photos of the closest whales K16 and K22. This marked CWR's first encounter with K pod in 2024. K pod was last sighted heading west off Sheringham Point on December 19th 2023 (see 2023 Encounter #77). The whales were averaging 8 knots over the bottom but even with a moderate ebb current to help them along they appeared to be in a hurry. Charging ahead of the two females, also quickly on the move, was the eldest bull K26. The team approached and took a couple left side photos of him and then two other bulls, K35 and K42, surfaced in unison. Their pace quickened and soon all the whales in view began porpoising, reaching speeds up to 11 knots! Mark steered Mike 1 southward as George spotted more scattered whales, which included K12, K27, and K36. After documenting these three, the team set their sights on locating the lead westernmost whales before backtracking for any they hadn’t seen. They glimpsed a distant large bull porpoising through the swell which turned out to be K33, accompanied by K43. K14 was located west of those two and once the team confirmed she was the lead animal, they turned east in search of the four unaccounted-for animals. Along the way, K22, now in the company of K27, passed Mike 1's starboard side, while K22's adult son, K33, breached a hundred metres to the southeast. Several minutes later, the team spotted siblings K38 and K45, who were busy socializing together. While observing these two, Brendon noticed a bull resembling K37 several hundred metres to the south, who was yet to be photographed. Just before the team could investigate, K16 and her son, K35, joined up with siblings K38 and K45, and all four gracefully passed by Mike 1's port side. Once clear, Mark steered the boat south to confirm K37 as the peripheral bull. The final animal to locate was K20. As the wind picked up, the team hoped to find her amongst the loose groups forming ahead. Fortunately, luck was on their side as they pushed ahead as the next female they found turned out to be none other than K20 herself! With that, all 15 members of K pod were accounted for and they ended the encounter at 1201.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-10

The web cameras showed that it was clear south of Sooke so they were hopeful that it would clear up just west of Race Rocks. They departed Victoria harbour at 1110 and headed for Race Pass. Mark kept a vigilant eye on the radar for boats and dodged the endless debris that has been around with the big tides and winter storms clearing the beaches. They busted out of the fog slightly west of Race Pass when they reached Church Rock and had a ~1.5 nm swath of clear visibility from the shoreline of Vancouver Island to offshore as far as Sooke. With no sightings by the time they reached the western edge of the fog bank near Otter Point they worked their way back to the east. With a report that the the fog had cleared east of Race Rocks they figured they would cross Victoria's waterfront to search that area which was previously shrouded in fog. As they approached Race Pass Mark received a report from his friend and colleague, Gary Neumann, that he spotted a group of ~ 10 spread out killer whales east bound near Clover Point with 1 large bull. At 1336 as Mike 1 was approaching the south end of Trial Island they spotted a pair of east bound dorsal fins. Mark immediately concluded they were Bigg's from the shape of the dorsal fins and was soon able to confirm 117B along with her first calf born in 2023, T117B1. They were traveling close to 8 knots and seemed to be the trailing animals as they spotted another individual to the east which turned out to be six year old T030B2 also racing along towards Discovery Island. As the Mike 1 crew was working their way towards another pair of animals they saw well ahead they saw a splash amongst a group of murres which Mark figured was the start of a hunt. Sure enough, T117B and her calf joined up with T030B2 and it appeared the matriarch, T117B had nabbed a likely seal amongst the feeding birds. The three of them milled around and did an inquisitive pass by Mike 1 and Mark could see prey remains in T117B's mouth. They then continued east to relocate the pair of animals that they had seen previously ahead of the trailing group and soon came across T030B with a brand new calf! Scanning all over with hopes to locate the bull that Gary had earlier seen from shore they spotted one other individual, eleven year old T030B1, who soon joined its mom, T030B and new sibling T030B3. Mark later contacted George Hamilton who was out on his fish boat closer to Discovery Island and told him to keep an eye out for a reported bull and any others. Mark figured that the bull was to the north of the group from Gary's shore based sighting info earlier. George finally got a lock on the bull close to the Seabird Point, Discovery Island which was ~ 2 nm north west of the lead T030Bs. As Mike 1 approached Seabird Point where he could see George's vessel standing by, Mark spotted what looked like a sprouter male along with a couple of others within a half mile to the north of his position. George never saw those individuals and the Mike 1 crew never saw them again either but were able to relocate the single bull which was confirmed as the 31 year old, T117A. Mark had encountered T117A along with T172 while guiding a commercial whale watch trip near Race Rocks on January 10th. T172 typically associates with the 117s and often with the 030Bs so was likely nearby but with the huge spread and long dives she was never spotted. As far as the possible sprouter bull and other two individuals that Mark had seen in the distance either it also seemed likely that there was another matriline in the area. T117A was following the eastern track line of the lead animals but well separated and moving much slower. He appeared content to be independent as the Mike 1 crew watched him successfully singlehandedly grab a likely seal ~ 4 nm south east of Discovery Island at the western edge of Middle Bank. After several minutes of scanning while T117A digested his catch and with no sign of the other animals Mike 1 ended the encounter at 1513.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-9

Colleagues from OBI and Orca Network soon reported from shore that it was J pod. Michael, Katie, and Dave left Snug at 13:48 and headed north through Mosquito Pass and Spieden Channel, receiving reports along the way that the whales had turned around and were now northbound in San Juan Channel. The team arrived on scene at 14:11 just north of Pt Caution. Most of J pod was in a single resting group, while a few adult males and juveniles socialized on the periphery. The J16s (except for J36) were initially the furthest whales inshore, followed by the J11s, J19s, J36, and J53, with the J35s being closest to the vessel. J45 and J44 socialized behind the rest of the group. J26 broke off shore to play with J44 and J45, and J16 and J42 fell behind the rest of the group. The team got a good look at these two, and confirmed that there was no calf travelling with them. The team then briefly paralleled the group of three males as J16 and J42 passed them up. Before going back to the main group, the team tried to catch up to J16 and J42. J39 broke off shore in front of them, while the two females went on a long dive. When they came back up, they were inshore of the team, closer to the main group of whales. After one more pass on the two females, the team moved back towards the main group. Back with the main group of whales, the team was able to get good looks at both J40 and J46, two more potential mothers for J60. Neither female had a calf travelling with them. The team also documented J37 and J59 travelling with the J22s. By this point the team had photographed every pod member other than J60, and it was becoming clear that the calf was no longer there. As the whales neared Spieden Channel, the team launched the drone to observe the group's behavior and to try to determine if any females were very visibly pregnant. The whales split into several groups as they entered Spieden. The first group the team flew over was the J35s, followed by the J19s (less J51) just a few body lengths ahead. They then switched groups, moving in shore to fly over the J22s, J37, and J59, who rolled around socializing beneath the surface. Ahead of this group were the J11s (less J39), J46, and J40, also engaged in relaxed socializing as they moved west through the channel. Behind and offshore of this group, J53 and J36 continued to socialize with each other, soon joined by the J22s, J37, and J59. J49 soon also joined this group. The team moved over to a group of males (J26, J44, J45, J51), who were socializing off shore. The wind began to pick up and it was threatening to rain, so the team landed the drone. The team stayed with the whales as they made their way west until the reached the west entrance of Roche Harbor, where the team ended the encounter at 16:08. Based on this encounter, we now believe that J60 is, sadly, deceased. Unlike adult whales, which may travel a significant distance from other whales for extended periods, we would not expect a one month old to be on its own for the length of time we observed the group.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-8

With no sightings on Victoria waterfront and better conditions west of Race Rocks they worked their way out Race Passage and headed west out the middle of the Strait. With several stops for binocular scans and once they made it south of Sooke they decided to work their way back east along the Vancouver Island shoreline starting at the west end of East Sooke Park. Upon reaching Church Rock, ~2.5 nm north west of Race Rocks, they decided to push south of Race Rocks for a final sweep before heading back to Victoria harbour. A few minutes after the passed south of Race Rocks they received a relayed report from Chris Hall who working with the Royal Canadian Navy demolition team at Bentick Island as a marine mammal observer that the Race Rocks guardian saw some killer whales at the pier inside Race Rocks! Mike 1 turned around and headed back towards Race Rocks while Mark gave the R.R. guardian a phone call for more info. Derek had last seen them within a couple of minutes exiting the reserve heading west after they popped up in the kelp below the hauled out and now very riled up Steller and California sea lions. Mike 1 slowed down outside the west edge of Race Rocks Reserve and saw what looked like four or five animals approaching ~ 1/4 nm away. To their surprise, they saw what looked like a footprint a few seconds later off Mike 1's bow and then a killer whale launched out of the water with a cartwheel. They immediately saw the reason for this burst of speed and activity as a young seal pup popped up in the frenzy. There was a brand new calf in the group which Mark thought may be T075C4. CWR first documented this new calf on January 1st in almost the same spot (see Encounter 01). Mark eventually was able to confirm his suspicion as T075C was the huntress who made short work of the seal pup while her one month old calf, two year old T075C3 and T075B2 circled around and watched her prowess. Within five minutes from the start of the hunt they saw a body part float to the surface which was soon grabbed by either T075C or T075B2. While Mark and George watched the five of them prey share they received a call from Derek that he was seeing three more animals still inside the R.R. Reserve. The Mike 1 crew eventually spotted them and it appeared they were slowly making their way towards them from the south edge of the reserve so they figured they would wait for them to join up to confirm that this group would include the two missing T075Bs. The prey sharing now seemed to be complete and the group was now slowly making their way east. With no sign of the others, George scanned with his binoculars towards the east and eventually spotted them a couple of miles away. Mike 1 made its way to the group and was able to confirm that it did include the missing two T075Bs; the matriarch T075B along with her newest offspring, two year old T075B4, and T077D were the other three that did not join the hunt. With no sign of any other T077s or any other individuals in the area the Mike 1 crew ended the encounter at 1511 and headed for Victoria Harbour.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-7

Michael and Katie left the dock at 13:30 and headed down island. Within a few minutes, they saw a large fin just north of Andrew's Bay, which they both immediately recognized as T19B. He was initially milling, but as they approached he began moving north. T19B took a few very long dives as he made his way north, making it hard to pace him. On his third sequence, he surfaced well ahead and inshore of the team, now accompanied by T19. The team caught up with the whales as they passed in front of Mitchell Bay. The whales angled towards Kellet Bluff, and after a long dive came up chasing a prey item well ahead of the team. By the time Michael and Katie caught up with them, they had already made their kill, with blood visible at the surface. The two whales milled for several minutes, processing their kill, which we believe to have been a harbor seal. Lots of birds joined in to scavenge, including two bald eagles, one of which attempted to fly away with a long piece of intestine. T19 and T19B started moving north again, and Katie spotted two more whales quickly making their way north from further down island. As the other two were catching up quickly, the team stuck with T19 and T19B as they moved slowly and predictably towards Kellet Bluff before going on a long dive. The team moved back towards the two trailing whales, which sure enough were T18 and T19C. These two moved quickly, apparently trying to catch up with the two leaders. The team paralleled them along the Henry Island shoreline until they caught up with the two leaders, at which point the whales spread out and angled towards Battleship. The team watched as the whales angled east, moving through the kelp on the south side of Battleship. At 15:00 Michael and Katie decided to backtrack to the south, looking for T60D and T60E.

We had some dark ripples at the beginning of the trip so could not get up to the speeds we were supposed to go to break in the engines. It was clear that the new boat is very fast but also rides really well. We all took turns driving as we tried different rpms across the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

We had all our gear with us because we wanted to see how much space we had on it so we decided to see how the whales would react to the new boat. The encounter began at 1525 east of Kelp Reef on the Canadian side of the border. The whales were in two loose groups with the front group a few hundred yards to the south of the rear group. The front group was in a loose formation and included T75B and the T75Cs, along with T77, T77C, and T77D. T77 was doing a lot of tail lobs and several cartwheels, as she had been before the encounter started, while they traveled slowly south down Haro Strait. This group seemed unconcerned with us and we got lefts and rights on them before moving on to the rear group. The rear group was also loosely spread but was being pretty social. All three of T75Bs kids were here, along with T77E and the sprouting brothers, T60D and T60E. This group was all over the place but still generally heading south following the lead group. The socializing whales were especially unconcerned with our presence and we were able to take both left and right ID shots of them. Any worries about how the whales would react to the new boat were quickly laid to rest when the whales repeatedly came over to check us out. We ended the encounter at 1600 mid-Haro Strait off the Lime Kiln Lighthouse. It was a really nice start with the new boat and we look forward to having many more encounters in it in the next couple of decades!",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-5

After battling through overhead swell and the accompanying two-foot surface chop from the moderate outflow winds, the guys found themselves off Point No Point. They estimated this was the farthest west the whales would be, so slowed for a scan. Seeing just a solitary humpback several miles farther southwest, they turned inshore and began working northeast toward Sheringham Point. They had documented a trio of humpbacks near Point No Point and were slowing for another three at Sheringham when several small, spread blows appeared just south of them…killer whales!
With daylight fading, they understood that it was not realistic to document each individual present, so instead focused on locating young J60 and whichever female he happened to be travelling with today. In the CWR’s most recent encounter with J pod (Encounter #03) J60 had been swimming with J16, though she is likely post-reproductive and a better candidate for the youngster’s grandmother than mother. Prior to that, J60 was first documented by researchers in Puget Sound alongside J40. Since Mark and Joe’s encounter with J pod last week, the operating theory has been that J60 actually belongs with the J16s, likely as J42’s first calf. This has been difficult to prove though, given that the pair have yet to be documented together!
Fortunately, the first animals the team slowed for were indeed J16, J42 and young J60! Today, the newest Southern Resident was travelling with J42. The whales were travelling quickly west, at one point eclipsing 10 knots as they surfed down the back side of the steep swells. J16 was slightly apart from the younger pair, and throughout the short encounter J60 never left J42’s echelon position. After pacing the animals west for a short time, the crew were able to determine that the rest of the pod were spread to the south and east, except J19 and a few others, who were confirmed visually approximately 400 metres northeast of the J16s. They ended the encounter south of Point No Point and began the journey home with J pod travelling quickly west-southwest with the strong ebb current.
Given J60's early wandering, we would like to see J60 alongside J42 consistently before we confirm their relationship, but today's encounter certainly supports the theory that J42 has indeed become a mother for the first time.
After departing the J16s and J19s, the team spotted a solitary J27 nearly 1.5 nautical miles east of the rest, travelling at a more leisurely pace. J27 was also toward the back of the pack for much of CWR’s late December encounter with the group, but with the large swells and low light in the Juan de Fuca today, it is possible that others were closer to him than we could determine.
Perhaps of note, J42 is sporting several fresh rake marks along her left flank, first noted by the CWR in our January 3rd encounter. It is possible that the question of J60’s maternity and these rakes are related, but we still have much to learn of intra-pod social dynamics and we are not able to make a correlation yet.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-4

Already aware of a group of Bigg’s near Middle Bank in south Haro Strait, he called George Hamilton to see if he could keep his spotting streak alive and scan north Haro Strait for the whales while he and Joe mobilized Mike 1. They departed the harbour just before 1400 as George was seeing spread out killer whales from his perch above Ten Mile Point, moving southward from Kelp Reef to slightly north west of Limekiln lighthouse. At 1432, Mike 1 slowed mid-Strait, several miles west of Lime Kiln and began their encounter with several well-spread J pod killer whales! J39 was the first animal they spotted, travelling near J31 and J56. A short-period southerly swell made it tough to locate more animals at first, but with patience the guys were able to spot a few more to the west and south, all of whom appeared to be angling southwest for Discovery Island. Shortly, the J11s, J19s, J22s and J37s loosely grouped together and angled for Sea Bird Point, and Mark and Joe moved off in search of the remaining J14s – J40 was observed alongside a new calf over the last week so they were hopeful they’d be able to catch a glimpse and confirm maternity – and the rest of J pod, the J16s and J17s. They finally spotted a small, tight group of whales well west of them, nearing the east entrance to Baynes Channel. As they approached, they could see that the group included a days-old calf! Somewhat surprising however, is that the rest of the whales were the J16s and a wandering J53. After reviewing the left eyepatch with the pictures taken on December 26 in Puget Sound they were able to confirm it was indeed J60. The calf was travelling particularly close to J16, but as J16 is now over 50 years old and did not appear pregnant during aerial encounters in October, we are skeptical that she is the mother. More likely, this youngster belongs to one of the younger J16s, but further encounters will be required to confirm this theory as it did not leave J16’s side throughout CWR’s observation today, and previous reports and photos had the calf travelling with J40. The J16s and their companion slipped into Baynes Channel while the rest of J pod, now out of sight, angled for Sea Bird Point at the south end of Discovery Island. Once into Baynes, the group hung a left and travelled into the Chain Islets, appearing to attempting to flush any lingering winter chinook out of the kelp along the periphery of the Islets. No obvious feeding was observed and, after travelling through the kelp along the southeast side of the rocks, the J16s continued southwest for Trial Island, while J53 turned southeast to rendezvous with the rest of the pod. The Mike 1 crew departed the J16s to check in on the rest of the whales, and confirm that there was indeed not another new calf in the mix with J40. They reacquired the animals just offshore of Commodore Point, now tightly grouped and heading for the J16s nearly a mile and a half ahead of them. In addition to the whales already documented, J40, J45 and the rest of the J17s were now also present, and there was no calf travelling alongside J40. The CWR team ended their encounter in the Oak Bay Flats at 1632 as the whales eased west into the Juan de Fuca, having documented each of the now 26 members of J pod.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-3

Mark and Joe decided to ring in the New Year with a survey of the Juan de Fuca, departing Victoria just before 1000 on the first day of the year. They were abeam Race Pass when they received a report of killer whales being seen from shore near Sheringham Point. They turned through the Pass and reached Otter Point less than a half hour later, though with the moderate outflow winds they found themselves in building 2’ seas and spotting was not easy. After about ten minutes of careful scanning while idling west, they finally spied a large bull killer whale burst through the waves just offshore of them. They angled out to meet the incoming whales, and when they surfaced for their next breath cycle, the CWR team quickly identified the T060 matriline of Bigg’s killer whales! The T060s are regular visitors to the Salish Sea throughout late summer and autumn, and usually return to the area early in the new year. The four animals – T060 and her offspring T060C, T060F and T060G – were grouped tightly and travelling northeast, toward Otter Point. They paused very briefly to nab an unassuming small mammal, perhaps a harbour seal, carrying on eastward after a spyhop from the matriarch and 45-second prey-share. The whales quickened their pace, making over seven knots into the head seas, and the guys saw them to Otter Point before ending the encounter and heading offshore and east to follow up a new report of westbound killer whales near Constance Bank. Note: T060 has two other living offspring, T060D and T060E, but they have dispersed from the matriline. They still travel with one another, but are rarely seen with the rest of the T060s anymore and were not present today.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-1

Fortunately, Mark was able to mobilize spotter extraordinaire, George Hamilton, ashore in Victoria with his image stabilized Zeiss 20 x 60s. He managed to spot the whales and steer Mike 1 to them, an impressive 11 miles from his perch on the Victoria waterfront! The animals were nearing the VF buoy south of Race Rocks by the time the encounter started, and they were happy to find some rarer visitors to the area in the T073As. This foursome – T073A and her offspring T073A1, a mature bull, T073A2 and T073A3 – is more well known from SE Alaska, but do make occasional forays into the Salish Sea, often in mid-winter and early summer. The whales were travelling restfully west in the Juan de Fuca, and the team was able to capture both right- and left-side ID photos of all four. T073A and T073A1 were giving the odd tail-lob and as the whales picked up their pace the guys suspected they had heard others. The T060s (Encounter #01) would be within acoustic range, but the T073As seemed to be angling southwest rather than toward Vancouver Island. After a few moments scanning ahead, Joe spotted what the T073As had heard: more killer whales, these ones moving northeast from the direction of Crescent Bay. Mike 1 trolled that way and just after 1300 came across a large group of Bigg’s. These animals were actually making little way northeast, apparently more interested in socializing. Present were the T075Bs, the T075Cs, and the T077s, for a total of 11 Bigg’s killer whales! Some excitement was added when a very young calf was spotted alongside T075C, its fetal folds and ruffled dorsal fin still very obvious. This is T075C’s fourth calf and though she lost her first two in the early years of life, it looks healthy and energetic. The whales were quite vocal, and tail-lobbing frequently with the odd dorsal slap mixed in. Eventually, the T073As joined the fracas from the east and the socializing continued. The guys kept half an eye on the Vancouver Island shore, some 3 miles north of them, anticipating the T060s’ possible approach, before Joe finally spotted them about two miles north of the large group. Although they were now aiming southwest, they did not seem to be making much speed and by the time Mark and Joe ended the encounter the T060s were still over a mile northeast of the rest. The whales continued their playful behaviour for some time, settling only a little for the final ten minutes of the encounter. The Mike 1 crew ended the encounter south of Beechey Head at 1410, leaving all 15 animals facing west in a loose grouping. After ending the encounter, the CWR team did approach the northern group to confirm that they were indeed the T060s, whom they had documented west of Sooke in the morning. The T060s were moving gradually toward the large aggregation offshore, but were not closing the gap quickly.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-2

There has been a significant killer whale presence throughout the Strait all month, so they were optimistic that more were around. Offshore of Otter Point, they paused to document a pair of humpback whales when several suspiciously thin blows appeared nearly two miles to the southeast. As they approached, it was clear that the source of the blows was not more humpbacks, but four or five more killer whales! With such a small group relative to the morning’s Residents, Bigg’s killer whales were assumed. The first whale the team identified was T075A, a large bull that CWR encountered with his mother in nearly the same location 10 days ago (see Encounter #72), and this time the duo were joined by some outer-coastal Bigg’s, T252 and the T253s! (see Encounter #74) The T075s are not uncommon December visitors to the area, and are also seen around Vancouver Island throughout May and June, but are most well-known from sightings in SE Alaska over the last 20 years. The T252s – T253 is presumed to be the daughter of T252 – are an outer-coastal matriline also seen regularly in the Juan de Fuca throughout the early winter months; however, this is the first time we are aware of the two matrilines being observed together. The whales were travelling east-southeast mid-Strait, loosely grouped. Initially, the T253s were the southernmost whales, with T075A and T252 a hundred metres apart just north of them and T075 several hundred metres north of those two. The outer-coastal female soon slid offshore of T075A to join T253 and T253A, leaving T075A tagging along a short way behind. The whales passed through a tide line and T075A briefly deked offshore, but no predation attempt was observed as the animals continued along east. T075 remained north of the other four, and all five whales seemed to be angling toward Port Angeles, rather than Race Rocks. Not seeing any sign of an imminent predation and not yet able to spot the bull T251, T252’s presumed son who was in her company as recently as a week ago, the Mike 1 team decided to end the encounter at 1402 and search farther south and east for any others.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-79

Just south of Constance Bank they came across a large, spread group of killer whales travelling southwest. Knowing Resident killer whales had been acoustically detected off East Point the previous evening, and given recent encounters with K and L pod killer whales, they had expected J pod to be near. They began the encounter at 1107 and confirmed their suspicion when J41 and her youngster J58 broke the surface just west of the J22s. J19 and J51 surfaced with J41 and J58, and J37 and her two offspring were between the two groups, and the four J16s soon arrived from the northeast; all of the whales were making good way toward the south end of Vancouver Island, perhaps anticipating the imminent change to ebb current in Race Passage. The guys paced the whales that way for a few minutes, documenting many of the 25-member pod. This is the first time CWR has encountered J pod in over a month. J49 is showing signs of sprouting, his 11-year-old dorsal fin noticeably more prominent than when he was observed in the summer. Apart from some intermittent tail-lobs and breaches, the pod continued their spread travel until nearing Race Rocks. As the whales approached the Rocks, they grouped together and eased through the park in a quick six minutes, passing south of North Race Rocks! As often as Southern Residents transit the Juan de Fuca, it is rare to see more than one or two individuals opt to go through the reserve; to watch the entire pod choose this path was quite the privilege! J27 was the sole animal not in the tight group of 24, but quickly closed the 300 metre gap to catch his cohort as they cleared West Race Rocks and dove, aiming offshore toward the middle of the Strait. The Mike 1 crew idled along near the whales for the subsequent breath sequence, wondering if the whales would fan out again and begin foraging. After a few minutes with no change in behaviour and each individual documented, they opted to end the encounter at 1222 and carry on west, leaving J pod angling southwest for the Olympic coast west of Crescent Bay. With this encounter, and those on the 17th and 19th, CWR has encountered all of the Southern Resident community but the L12 subgroup within the last week.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-78

Sure enough, less than 20 minutes after leaving the Bigg's, they spotted several westbound killer whales ~ 3.5 n ssw of Otter Point, quickly confirmed to be members of L pod! As they were on Sunday, the animals were spread over several miles, to the west and southwest from where Mike 1 caught up to them. The guys did their best to document as many of the not only spread but long-diving animals as they could and were pleasantly surprised that L87 was one of the first individuals Mark was able to photograph! The 31-year-old vagabond has spent time with all three pods of J Clan since his mother passed in 2005 and is thought to have most recently been associating with the L12 subgroup. He was not observed with the group of L4s, L47s, L54s and L72s that were encountered two days ago.
Just over a mile west of L87 and some spread L4s, Mark spotted a leading group of comparatively tight whales and opted to move that way. These lead animals proved to be K pod killer whales moving steadily southwest and very spread out. After photographing 11 of the 15 members of Kpod and no sign of any other Ls among them this made Mark wonder if perhaps L87 met K pod when they exited the Salish Sea last week (see Encounter #73). Whatever the case, L87 had been absent from CWR's recent SRKW encounters, and we were happy to document him today. 
Mark and George backtracked over a mile to the north east before they found some of the trailing L's still spread out moving much more slowly than the K's. L72 along with her son, L105, were the first pair they came across. They hadn't seen these two when they started the encounter with the trailing Ls, so they were hopeful they could find the L12s mixed in. They then located L125 messing about in a tide line and watched her briefly pick up a piece of kelp in her mouth as she slalomed her way through the debris before she joined up with her older brother, L106. No members of the L12s or L54s could be seen amongst the remaining Ls and with a little over an hour to go to get back to the harbor and the same for the time it would be dark, the guys ended the encounter at 1517 ~2.5 nm south of Jordan River.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-77

This motivated George to get on the Race Rocks web camera to test his already proven superb skills of navigating the remote-controlled camera and lock onto some Blackfish. Sure enough, at 0940, he spotted ""lots"" of spread-out killer whales to the south of Race Rocks heading west with a couple of groups passing through the kelp at the southeast edge of R.R. reserve. He immediately called Mark to let him know of his sighting of what seemed most likely to be Resident killer whales. Mark suggested meeting down at the dock, but I let him know they would have to wait until some mechanical work on Mike 1 was completed. This delay would at least allow for better water conditions as the moderate outflow winds were forecasted to abate by early afternoon. Mark and George departed the dock at Victoria harbour at 1145 and made their way west out the Juan de Fuca. With a building ebb, Mark calculated that they would likely have to go at least to Otter Point before they would come across the animals that George had seen from the R.R. camera.
At 1241, as the Mike 1 crew were approaching Secretary Island at the west end of East Sooke Park, Mark spotted a pair of killer whales coming towards them directly off their bow. His instinct was they would turn out to be Bigg's as there was no sign of any others, and he expected that the likely Residents that George saw would be well west of that location continuing west. The well marked Bigg's T137D appeared abeam of them within a couple of minutes while they sat and waited for a re-sight and moments later her brother, a mature bull, T137A, surfaced within 50 metres of her.
T137A and T137D travelled apart from their mother and sister for just over a month this past summer, from August 28 through October 2. They spent much of that time in the company of T037A3 and T037A4. T137 and T137B were only encountered sparingly in that month but may have been travelling around the Strait of Georgia or the Discovery Islands archipelago just north. As far as we know, the matriline has been together since reforming in early October, though they have not been encountered anywhere since Mark saw them travelling west in the Juan de Fuca Strait on a commercial whale watch trip in late November.
Mike 1 trolled east with the pair for the next 15 minutes while Mark and George scanned around, looking for any others. With no sign of any, they ended the encounter at 1257 and pushed on westward with hopes of catching up to the big group that George had seen that morning from the Race Rocks camera.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-76

They picked up speed at Ogden Point just before 1100 and soon spotted a spread group of whales just southwest of Constance Bank. The whales travelled southwest, and fins could be seen for over a mile south and east, suggesting that Southern Residents were present! Sure enough, the nearest two animals surfaced to reveal themselves as L83 and L110. L115 was not far away, and all three were making their way southwest. As these animals disappeared on a dive, the guys began assessing the spread and spotted a few loosely associating pairs of whales to their southeast. They manoeuvred Mike 1 toward those animals and confirmed the presence of L72 with L105, L91 with L122, L86 with L106, and L86’s youngster L125 nearby with L118. L118 was sporting a unique nick at the very tip of her dorsal fin, new since the last time they saw her in the summer. As the latter pair joined L86 and L106, all continuing southwest, Mark and Joe spotted a large bull on the horizon to the east and a few others beyond him. They idled that way to confirm the presence of L88! The 30-year-old bull travels with the L54 matriline. His adoptive brother L117 was nearby, and the two met up shortly thereafter. The nearby male-female pair were actually L55 and her son L109, though, and it wasn’t for another half hour that the guys were able to find L54 and L108, the remaining L54s. The L54s are not often with this subgroup of L pod, nor are they often observed in the inside waters of the Salish Sea. They spend the bulk of their time off the outer coast of BC and Washington and tend to associate more with the other part of the L pod – the L12s, L22 and L25 – who have followed a similar pattern in recent years. The whales had been making good time with the strong ebb current and accelerated further as they got southeast of Race Rocks and angled west. Southwest of Race Rocks and south of East Sooke Park, the animals finally slowed and began exhibiting some foraging behaviour. The team on Mike 1 departed the area just after 1330 and turned home, having documented all but one of the 22 theoretically present animals. L90 was the lone member of the subgroup not photographed, but given the large spread – approximately 3 square miles – it is likely that she was present somewhere within the group. L87 was not present today, nor was he present when CWR last encountered this subgroup of L pod in October (see Encounter #67). However, it seems likely that he has joined to the L12 / L22 / L25 subgroup for the time being, having been observed near them in late November by colleagues in the Canadian Gulf Islands.

Outer-coastal Bigg’s killer whales are more rarely encountered than their inner-coastal counterparts – sometimes years pass between successive documentations of individuals or even entire matrilines – and we are still learning about their social dynamics and population structure. Due to their frequent interaction and shared acoustic repertoire, both inner- and outer-coastal Bigg’s are considered part of one continuous population of mammal-hunting killer whales, ranging from SE Alaska to California and generally encountered inshore of the continental margin. With light fading, the guys weren’t sure they’d be able to reacquire the whales, but given it could be a year before these individuals appeared again, they forged on. After stopping for a fruitless scan in the gloom, they opted to turn south, putting them approximately three miles ahead of where the animals were last seen. After another five minutes, Joe spotted a single male killer whale travelling west nearly two miles south of Mike 1. They slowed to a stop when they reached the area where Joe's estimate of where he had seen him and after a couple minutes of all three crew anxiously scanning, Mark reacquired the bull's trailing edge on his last dive through his binoculars moving westward ~ a half mile west of them. After several more what seemed like long minutes Brendon reacquired him ~ a quarter mile to the north east. They began the encounter at 1517 with T251, a regular winter visitor to the Salish Sea who is rarely observed anywhere else along the coast. He typically travels near his presumed mother and sister, T252 and T253, though there were no other whales in view. The crew followed T251 for another breath cycle, before pausing to scan for the others. Mark finally spotted them over a mile astern of the westbound bull and, through his trusty Swarovskis, thought they may be exhibiting predation behaviour. By the time Mike 1 arrived in their vicinity, the large group of females and juveniles was treading water and rolling playfully. It appeared they were finishing off a meal, but the CWR team was unable to confirm this.

As they dove, the whales grouped up and aimed west, so Mike 1 putted along the same way. Some of the Bigg’s were familiar, T252, T253 and T241A among them, but the remaining 4-5 animals took some work. They were eventually confirmed to be the remaining T241s and a wandering female, T254, who has previously been documented twice off the west coast of Vancouver Island, but this is her first confirmed presence in the Salish Sea! 

T253A was also present, a whale that CWR has documented every year since his/her birth in 2019, along with a youngster that appears to be an approximately one- to two-year-old offspring of T241A. If confirmed, it would be her first documented calf, but given amount of time between sightings, and the behaviour observed today, it will take subsequent documentation to confirm this relationship. The team paced the eight Bigg’s slowly west for a few more minutes, documenting each individual present, and left them heading toward Race Rocks with dusk approaching at 1615 and headed north to Victoria. They did not see T251 again, but presume he had continued west as the others plodded along in that direction.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-74

Mark felt it was likely members of K pod, seeing as they were down in Puget Sound the day before, and he felt they would likely be on their way out by this time. He left the dock at Victoria harbour with George at ~ 1110 and headed towards Hein Bank. The conditions improved the further east they got, and by the time they had stopped for their second binocular scan at the north edge of Hein Bank, the sun was shining, and the seas were less than a foot chop. After several minutes of scanning and no more seen than a pair of Steller sea lions basking in the sun on the north Hein Bank marker and a sea otter rolling around with a dead Common murre in its grasp, the Mike 1 crew pushed further to the southeast towards the original sighting stopping and scanning every couple of miles. With no sign of any killer whales and now within 3 nm of the original sighting, Mark felt they likely went west out of Juan de Fuca rather than the reported northwest track. They headed past Romeo buoy on a line for Race Rocks and left the flat water and sun behind them. Mark called his friend Gord to let them know that they hadn't had any luck with their search efforts and were heading for the barn, so Gord had another Big Eye scan from his 23rd apartment ""Crow's Nest. Moments after Mike 1 made a turn for Victoria harbour, calling it a valiant effort as they passed north of Constance Bank, Gord called on the VHF to say he finally spotted some westbound killer whales way south of Victoria on the stern of the Coho ferry bound for Victoria! Mike 1 turned south and bounced its way south with the moderate north winds and two-foot chop and headed toward the Coho, which was a small dot on the horizon. At 1450 ~ 3.5 nm southeast of Race Rocks, Mark slowed the boat down when he got within a mile of where Gord figured he saw them last, and George soon spotted a bull on the horizon. Moments later, they saw several spread-out whales moving steadily westbound and confirmed the K pod. The first whale they approached was a young animal that Mark suspected was the newest member of the pod, K45, and a moment later, K20 surfaced alongside to confirm it was her. K20's nineteen-year-old son, K38, was close by, trailing behind them. For the next hour, Mark and George worked their way to the south until they ran out of whales after locating K16 and her son, K35, well south of the group. As the light was diminishing, they ended the encounter at 1556, with K12 leading the western charge at the northern edge of the group ~1.5 nm southwest of Race Rocks, with the two lads K26 and K42 lagging behind. To Mark's surprise, they were able to document all fifteen members of the pod in the hour they were on scene.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-73

Turning offshore from Race Rocks, they aimed for Pillar Point in calm seas. About four nautical miles north of Low Point, on the Olympic coast, they spotted the first and second of nine humpbacks they would document throughout the day. Humpback whales have been plentiful throughout the central Juan de Fuca recently; between killer whale encounters, the Victoria CWR team has been able to document more than 25 unique individuals over the past week and a half, supporting the region’s long-term humpback population studies. At 1315, they were abeam Pillar Point and quickly approaching a wall of misty rain, so decided to stop and scan before losing visibility and heading north toward Vancouver Island and the northeast. Quickly though, Mark spotted a reason for them to stay west a little longer! A mile or so northwest of the boat, he caught a glimpse of two male killer whales slowly moving into the mist. They approached the area carefully and began the encounter at 1321. The males did not immediately reappear, but the first whales the guys saw were Bigg’s, T077D and T037A4 among them. Those two and several others appeared to be in the early stages of predation; sure enough, a young harbour seal soon appeared in their midst. T037A, T075A and T077 appeared from beneath and appeared to be doing the lion’s share of the work. The three matriarchs made short work of the small pinniped, taking it below for the last time at 1330. T037A3, T037A4 and T077E shared in the spoils, but were more playful than hungry. The prey-sharing was chaotic and lasted just a little longer than the short hunt. The team was able to get some updated photos of T037A4’s odd dorsal fin warp and enjoy the chorus of vocalizations that followed the hunt, audible above the surface! Meanwhile, the bulls had resurfaced on the horizon to the south, and they appeared to actually be three animals. Mark and Joe angled that way, and by the time they arrived T075 had joined the others – T075A, T037A2 and T077C. It is unclear whether these animals had a simultaneous meal or simply did not join in the prey-sharing. T037A2 and T077C were particularly social throughout the encounter. After some mingling, all of the whales began meandering east loosely abeam one another, though they made little way against the ebb current. T075 and T075A seemed the most efficient, aiming almost straight and swimming slowly; the bulk of the T037As and T077s were only slightly off the pace to the southwest, and T037A2 and T077C seemed interested only in each other as they zigged and zagged playfully between the others. Mark and Joe ended the encounter in the Separation Zone at 1445 with all 10 animals working slowly eastward, less than a quarter mile between the northern- and southern-most individuals.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-72

The made their way toward Crescent Bay and documenting 11 humpback whales along the way – they saw at least 15 – primarily feeding on krill, before continuing west toward Clallam Bay and Jordan River in search of blackfish. Just south of Sheringham Point, the guys detected the distinct sweet odour of a pinniped predation and stopped the vessel immediately, finding themselves smack in the middle of a 200 metre by 200 metre slick of glassy, oily water on the surface of an otherwise choppy strait. They scanned all ways for three minutes but could not spot the culprits, and decided that given they had arrived from the west and seen nothing, it was more likely the animals were farther east. Sure enough, nearly 2.5 nm east of the slick, killer whale fins appeared just offshore of their transit! The team started the encounter at 1510, roughly 3.5 nm southwest of Otter Point with a non-descript group of female and juvenile Bigg’s killer whales. The animals soon revealed themselves to be the T046Bs, when the uniquely-notched T046B2 and her young calf broke the surface. The group actually contained two animals under a year old, T046B7 being the other healthy-looking tyke. The younger “B2B” was first observed less than a week ago, on November 25th, and appears to be well under a month old. Today, the T046Bs were joined by close relative T046C2, a wandering female who has been spending more time in the Salish Sea recently. The whales were gently surfing the northeasterly chop to the southwest, the ebb current carrying them quicker than their effort suggested. They were in a relatively tight formation, travelling more-or-less abreast, with no dive longer than three minutes. With light fading and the animals showing no signs of imminent behaviour change, the Mike 1 team ended the encounter at 1530 having collected right- and left-side identification photos of each of the eight animals present. Note: T046B2 was observed with a calf in late 2021, but was not seen with it again, and it is believed to have passed sometime in its first few months of life. She likely became pregnant again shortly thereafter, in late spring 2022.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-71

It was a nice day so Dave loaded up, drove to Snug Harbor, and left in the boat at 1135. Mark reported the other matriline as being the T68Cs - a group that is not overly common in the area. Mark had to leave before Dave got there but Dave spotted the whales about where Mark thought they would be about a half mile to the southwest of Kelp Reef at 1150. The encounter began at 1153. The T49As (minus T49A2) and the T68Cs (minus T68C1) were in a tight group and were pointed right at Kelp Reef. They passed the reef and then turned northwest up Haro Strait. Dave was able to get some left side shots. Around 1215, the whales went on a long dive and finally came up a little further to the east in the middle of a chase of some kind. What they were after was never seen but the whales were stretched out north to south and porpoising north with most of the T49As in the lead and most of the T68Cs trailing. The attack was either successful or they gave up pretty quickly and there was some milling around as the T49As came back to the T68Cs. All the whales grouped up again and turned west toward D’Arcy Island which made for an opportunity to get better left sides. Around 1240, the whales began porpoising up Haro Strait. Against his better judgement, Dave decided to end the encounter there because he thought he had things to get done. Transients porpoising for several miles often means that they hear other whales in the middle of a kill. However, Dave was sure that if he had stayed, the whales would have kept porpoising until they passed Nanaimo. While heading into Snug Harbor, Dave passed the Cogan’s “Morning Star” on their way out. Dave was back at CWR downloading photos when he received a text from Jane Cogan saying that, sure enough, the T49As and the T68Cs had joined the T18s who were in the process of attacking a minke whale near Turn Point. He decided to head out again despite little hope of getting there in time to see the attack, leaving Snug for the second time that day at 1405 and arriving back on scene around 1430. The minke was already dead by then and the whales were feeding on the carcass, which was not visible, about a half mile north of the Turn Point lighthouse. A blubber slick could be seen and smelled. The T18s, T49As, and T68Cs (fourteen whales total) were milling and feeding like Ts normally do on a large carcass. Small groups and individuals would surface milling before going on a long dive to feed on the sunken carcass. When some whales went on a long dive, others who had been down feeding would surface to breath. They had killed the minke in one of the deepest parts of the San Juans so they may have had to dive fairly deep to feed. Some individuals or pairs would occasionally move off to about a quarter mile away from the spot before drifting back to the slick area. At about 1515, a large humpback whale showed up from the south and charged right into the middle of the feeding Ts. It seemed to be trying to disrupt the feeding event, almost chasing the Ts around and blowing energetically (if not quite full blown trumpeting). At no point did it look like the Bigg’s were harassing the humpback or even overly concerned about its presence. As the sun sank closer to the horizon, T49A1 and maybe one or two others had drifted away the area but the other Ts continued to feed and the humpback continued its attempts to annoy them. Dave ended the encounter (again) at 1610 with the Ts still feeding and the humpback still amongst them. The humpback disturbing the peace was later identified by Joe Z. and Mark as BCX1377 or “Nike”. Melisa Pinnow, who was aboard “Morning Star” with the Cogans during the attack, identified the minke as “Clone”, an ailing whale known to whale watchers. Melisa reported that “Clone” had been hanging out in the Minke Lake area for the past couple of months with a deteriorating body condition. The SR3 drone team had reported that they had seen the T18s in the Wasp Islands earlier that morning.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-70

He didn't confirm any IDs but felt that it may have been J pod spread out foraging with a potential easterly trend.

With the short window of light remaining in the day, Mark jumped into action and made his way to Mike 1, docked in Victoria Harbor. George Hamilton met him at the boat at 1430, and they headed off. Knowing that they would be limited in time for the encounter with the diminishing daylight, Mark had earlier called Gord Rowles to track the group from his 23rd-floor perch so the Mike 1 crew would not waste any time relocating the group.

Within 15 minutes of departing Victoria Harbor, Gord put them on the lead animals approaching the southern edge of Constance Bank heading east. The first animal they came across was J40, leading the charge with J37 close behind. Mark and George worked as efficiently as possible with the large spread to get as many animals confirmed as possible. The next pair they encountered slightly south and west of the two lead animals was J38 along with K42. Mark was shocked at how big K42 had gotten since the last time he saw him in July near Swiftsure Bank! 

They found K26 close by on his own before they had to work their way to the south close to a mile before they came across any others. J47 was the first whale they came across, along with J35 and J57. The animals to the south appeared to be tracking northeast towards the lead animals they were with previously. The first decent-sized group they came across included K16, K22 with three bulls, K33, K35 and K37. K20 and K45 were amongst others that soon joined as the whales started grouping up. J27 was alone shadowing this group but soon joined in. 

It appeared that the group was on a line for Middle Bank. The wind was starting to build, and the light was fading, so unfortunately, Mark felt it was time to end the encounter at 1559 despite knowing that the entire J and K pods would likely be together in the next 30 minutes and they could have cleaned them up.

*note- Mark got confirmation from Rachelle Hayden/Salish Sea Orca Squad that at least J pod went northeast through Active Pass the following morning at 0915.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-69

Challenging seas made for slow progress, but a recently departed commercial whale watch vessel communicated that the animals were slowly working northeast along Coyote Bank. As they neared the Bank, they spotted a few distinctive killer whale dorsal fins cresting the horizon around a mile and a half ahead.

The animals disappeared for nearly five minutes as Mike 1 slowed, and the guys began the encounter at 1600. When they reappeared, the whales – quickly confirmed to be T137 and her offspring – were travelling northeasterly in a tight group. The four whales continued along the northern edge of Border Bank for another ten minutes before erupting to the surface after a prolonged dive, apparently hunting.

It took a few moments for Mark and Joe to spot the unfortunate prey, a large harbour seal. The killer whales wasted little time getting to work, ramming the small pinniped repeatedly, the matriarch even launching it into the air with the crown of her head. Though the seal survived this early onslaught, it proved no match for the hungry Biggs; the fresh, sweet smell of pinniped oil soon filled the air above a small slick at the surface, and the predation was deemed ‘successful’ at 1635, just 20 minutes after it began.

Mark and Joe ended the encounter at 1645 and made for Victoria, leaving the whales drifting toward Middle Bank as they shared the spoils.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-68

The team met at Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 0852. Since the calls on the East Point hydrophone were faint, we didn’t think the whales would be coming down Boundary Pass but might come down President Channel or Rosario Strait. We headed north around Kellett Bluff with the plan of heading east through Spieden Channel, then up President Channel, and over the top of Orcas Island towards Alden Bank if need be. Around Battleship, we started to get rained on hard. We debated the wisdom of going on and kept going. We made it to the Minke Lake area when we received a report that a lot of whales had been seen between Barnes and Clark Islands and the Lummi Island shoreline. The rain lightened up some and we changed our course and took as direct of a line through the San Juan Islands towards Rosario Strait as we could. We reached Rosario about a half hour later and headed north. We had not seen anything by the time we reached the Peapod Rocks so we stopped to take a scan just north of them. We soon spotted our first dorsal fin as it rounded Lawrence Point and the encounter started at 1018 just a little south of there. The first whales we saw were all of the L47s and L72s in tight group. We got left sides on them as they headed southwest down Rosario Strait, passing the Peapods on the west side. Over a quarter mile to the northeast of this group, we found L82 and L116 traveling loosely together. They passed the Peapods on the east side. Other whales were spread out to the northeast in singles, pairs, and small groups. After we were done with the L82s, we photographed K35 mid-Rosario, while L90 and members of the K14s were spread out behind him. Further west, back closer to the Peapods, we saw the K20s in a loose group. K20 was out front while K38 and K45 seemed to be socializing behind her. To the east of the K20s, members of the L55s began to appear and soon joined up in a tight group minus the L82s. To the northwest of the L55s, the K14s and others stared to group up too while the K20s seemed to stall out and dropped back behind the larger groups. K27 briefly joined the K16s before she and K43 hooked up and began traveling with the K14s. We got left and right ID shots of, as well as the drone up and over, the larger groups. The K16s remained in the area but drifted away from the others. L90 by herself as well as the L82s were also bouncing around the area. Near the bottom of Rosario Strait, the rest of the K12s finally appeared on the west side of the channel. The K12s and K14s group morphed into one loosely spread out group as they rounded Watmough Head. The whales spread out more as they turned west off the south end of Lopez Island. Some whales went inside Colville Island. We had found everyone we had expected to find of the Ks and Ls present other than the L86s and L87. We figured that they were still a ways behind the Ks and Ls back in southern Rosario with J pod. Most of the Ks and Ls were still heading westerly in singles and small groups west of Colville Island when we left them at 1410. We dropped back all the way to Watmough Head again before other groups of whales started showing up. The front group was a little offshore and was the J19s and J39. Inshore, and to the northwest of them, another group that included the L86s, J35s, as well as J44 and J46 were turning the corner around Watmough Head. This group was cooperative and we were getting both good left side ID shots on them and good drone footage. Then they caught the wake of a tug and barge and surfed away so that was the end of that group. Other whales were loosely spread out nearer to the Lopez shoreline and inside of Colville Island. The whales closer to shore began to move off it and form up. The J14s, J22s, along with J36 and J53 joined together and the rest of the J16s soon joined them. This group was also cooperative and we got good left side ID shots on them along with drone video as they traveled west off the south end of Lopez Island. The J31s and J27 stayed to the north and inshore of the larger group. The whales began spreading out as they passed the north edge of McArthur Bank. We ended the encounter at 1550 a couple of miles southwest of Iceberg Point. L87 did not seem to be present but he has moved around a lot over the years so it is possible he was out off the coast with the L12s, L54s, and L88 who also were not present.
NOTE: This was the third encounter in which we confirmed all of K pod except K34. When whales are consistently missing from encounters with their social associates for this long, it is likely that they are deceased. At this point, K34 is considered missing. The CWR will share our SRKW population update at the start of 2024, which will include information on any deaths inferred to have occurred since the July 1st 2023 census.

Brendon joined him at the dock, and they set off on Mike 1 at 1545. By this time, the quartet of whales had surged eastward at 8 knots and merged with a larger group already engrossed in a sea lion predation.
The encounter began at 1620 as Mark and Brendon entered the scene, greeted by what seemed to be a dozen or more whales. Brendon identified the matrilines as the T035As, T036As, T038As, along with the T123s, who were the ones previously spotted heading east. This brought the grand tally to seventeen whales.
The sea lion, a mid-sized Steller, remarkably held its own despite the relentless onslaught from the whales. By 1500, it was apparent that the whales were deliberately extending the pursuit, taking moments to socialize, rest and regroup before the next onslaught. Brendon observed the lead huntress to be 23-year-old T038A. With assistance from both T036A1 and T123, she orchestrated the majority of the sea lion chase. While this trio pursued the hunt, the juveniles engaged in socialization. T036A hovered approximately a hundred meters away with some of the other youngsters, seemingly at rest, while T123A maintained prolonged dives on the periphery.
Perhaps cognizant of the sea lion's vigor, the true onslaught commenced around 1845. Repeated passes were made at the sea lion, each more intense than the last. As the hunt approached its conclusion, so too did the day itself; Mark noted the dwindling sunlight and was aware that the opportunity to return home with any residual daylight was slipping away. At 1904, the decision was made to conclude the encounter and set course for Victoria after a final pass from T036A & T036A5.

In the afternoon, as the fog began to lift, the team heard reports over the radio of a group of whales on the west side, heading north from San Juan County Park. The team ran down to the beach, where they photographed the whales as they swam past very close to shore. The team IDed the whales as the T49As, without T49A1 or T49A2. The team met up at Snug to see if they could get some drone footage of the whales, and got off the dock at 15:24. When the team left Snug, the whales were hunting a seal just outside the harbor in Mitchell Bay. The team launched the drone and observed the whales processing and sharing their kill, before heading north towards Open Bay. The whales picked up speed and rounded Kellet Bluff, heading up Henry Island. They cut inshore of Battleship, taking a moment to rest in a kelp bed before heading east through Spieden Channel. The whales slowly made their way past Barren Island and Davison Head, before taking a turn and heading northeast towards Green Point. The team saw that there were several Steller sea lions on the point, and hoped the whales might attempt a hunt. However, after approaching the south side of Spieden, the whales made a turn and headed back west along the Spieden shoreline, making a few harbor seal kills as they went. As the whales passed Sentinel Rock, the group split, with T49A, T49A3, and T49A6 moving further west while T49A4 and T49A5 hunted together to the east. The trio reached Danger Shoal and then turned back around to meet up with the other two. After meeting back up, the whales headed towards the western tip of Spieden. T49A6 went off on his own back east, before porpoising back towards the rest of the group. As the main group rounded Spieden, they happened upon a seal in the shallows. The whales swiped at the seal and attempted to catch it, but the lucky seal managed to hurl itself out of the water and onto the safety of the rock. T49A6 followed behind a couple minutes later, apparently eager to catch up with the rest of the family. The whales spread out and milled near Spieden Bluff.

He headed south of Race and went west out the middle of the Juan de Fuca Strait. With most of his effort scanning to the south towards the U.S. side, as Mark was south of Sheringham Point at 1044, he spotted a flash of white water less than a mile to the north and soon confirmed a group of 4 or 5 females and juvenile killer whales surfing east in the 2-metre swell. As he approached, he could see a few more ~ .5 nm further north, paralleling them. Mark eventually confirmed members of the T046Bs as he paralleled along with them at 8 knots, and after a few minutes, they picked the pace up to 11 knots, with T046C2 leading the charge. With hopes that their ""High T"" friends from the day before were perhaps the ones to the north or nearby, Mark went to investigate as a commercial whale watch boat arrived from the south to watch the now spread out T046Bs along with T046C2. After a couple of minutes of scanning, while Mark stood on the front of the console to get a bit more height to see above the moderate swell, he reacquired the ones to the north and confirmed it was the three T046B1s with no sign of any others in the area. These three angled towards Sooke, and at 1215, they stalled out as they came across a baby seal laying in a kelp raft ~2.5 nm southwest of Secretary Island while the rest of the T046B's who were now reported well to the southeast east continuing steadily eastward. Mark stayed with the trio of T046B1s and watched them go after what proved to be the feistiest seal Mark had ever seen preyed upon. It was interesting how careful they were as they circled the kelp raft, occasionally blowing bubbles from underneath, attempting to dislodge it from its safe haven. Every time one of them approached, the young seal would growl at them and occasionally grab kelp strands in its mouth to shake at its foe. Remarkably, after over 50 minutes of hunting what seemed like a determined target, they left it untouched and moved on.

After a thorough scan of the area and talking with some sport fishers who hadn't seen any killer whales, he made his way south toward the T018s, who were southwest of Race Rocks and moving quickly in a southwesterly direction. At 1218, he came across T019 and T019C approximately 1.5 nm southwest of Race Rocks, travelling at a steady 7 knots to the southwest. After getting proof-of-presence pictures of both, Mark made his way 0.5 nm to the south, where he could see T019B also moving quickly southwest into a moderate swell. T018 was apparently to the north of the group, as confirmed by a commercial whale watch boat that was with them before Mike 1 arrived. Mark figured that he would eventually spot her as he tracked the large bull, T019B, who was now travelling at nearly 10 knots on a line for Crescent Bay. Mark speculated that he was honing in on another group of killer whales with his slightly more southerly direction change and increase in speed. After a quick scan and not seeing any distant blows, Mark headed north to get a proof of presence picture of T018, who had been relocated a mile north of the other three members of her family by one of the commercial whale-watching boats. After several minutes of waiting for a re-sight of T018, he got word that many killer whale blows were being observed near Crescent Bay, ahead of T019B! Mark manoeuvred Mike 1 back to the southwest and arrived as T019B was closing in on a group of 10-12 animals with a large bull that Mark did not recognize. He immediately concluded that he was likely a ""high T,"" as in a rare visitor to the area, as he could see a few other unrecognizable animals in the vicinity. These ""high Ts,"" so-called for their alphanumeric designation (generally above ""T200""), spend most of their time in open waters, likely patrolling the continental shelf. They are considered outer-coastal and only occasionally join the more well-known inner-coastal Bigg's killer whales in inside waters. The T046Bs were also in the mix, and this family is often seen associating with ""high Ts."" Mark soon got word after sending a picture he took with his iPhone of the viewfinder on the back of the camera to Joe, who confirmed on FinWave that the bull was T348. This confirmed that this truly was Mark's first time seeing this lad. T348 and his gang grouped up and slowly wandered west as the rest of the T018s came into the area to investigate the newcomers. Mark watched T019B approach T348's group, dive, and then could see that they had a quick underwater skirmish as the surface of the water was briefly turbulent before T019B moved back towards the rest of his family and the T046Bs. The T348 gang then turned back to the east as they all milled around the area for the next two hours. Once Mark felt that he had got decent pictures of the outer-coastals, he ended the encounter at 1633. Mark later learned that the other individuals were confirmed as the T249s, T352 and T356. Each of the T249s, T348, T352 and T356 are rarely encountered anywhere, and this is the first time any of them have been observed in the Salish Sea! The T249s (also known as the CA222s by our California colleagues) were most recently by DFO researchers in 2019 near Barkley Canyon, off the outer coast of Vancouver Island, travelling with other outer-coastal Bigg's known primarily from the California coast. The T352s (CA206s), including T352, T348 and T356, have been seen only sparingly off the outer coast of Vancouver Island before today, though via documentation from the California coast, we know T352 to be the mother to the bull T348. The relation of T356 to the rest is presumed - daughter to T352, brother to T348 - but not confirmed. T352 and her kin were first documented in the early 2000s in Monterey Bay and have since been observed with a wide range of individuals from both the outer- and inner-coastal populations. That list included well-known Salish Sea visitors, the T036s, T036As, T046s, T046Cs and T137s, before adding the T018s and T046Bs today.

Sure enough, at 1109, Mark spotted T049C eastbound along the shoreline at the edge of the kelp line at Bentick Island in Race Passage. Likely hearing the group prey sharing the Steller sea lion ~ 4 nm to the east, T049C altered his course and picked up his pace to between 7 and 8 knots on a direct line towards them.

He could see a lot of activity going on with a lot of splashing in the distance. Mike 1 left Victoria harbour at 0830 and, within a few minutes, spotted a group of killer whales slightly west of Constance Bank. Mark started the encounter at 0838 and could see they were hunting a bull Steller sea lion. The group consisted of the 046B1s along with T046C2, the T099s and the T123s, totalling thirteen whales. Certainly lots of combined strength and skill, especially with three experienced matriarchs! T046B1 seemed to be the most aggressive with her leaps and lunges at the Steller, although her oldest daughter, T046B1A, was taking several turns at him, as was her dispersee niece, T046C2. The rest of the gang took a few swipes at the bull Steller throughout the barrage while the bull T123A and sprouter male T099C were most often just at the edge of the action circling around, which is often the way with the lads during sea lion hunts. Certainly, the females are more agile and better hunters, so perhaps it is best to let them do the bulk of the work. The hunt lasted at least 3 hours as it seemed apparent that it was underway when Mark received the call from the fishing guide at 0740, and it ended at 1045 when the Steller was finally tired enough for the group to drown it. Mark ended the encounter at 1054 after watching a few celebratory leaps by a few members of the hunting party, with the youngster, T046B1C, being the most boisterous. The T018s had been found within a couple of miles to the south of the group while the hunt was still underway but never got inside a mile of the action.

Sure enough, the T109A's did the same, but this time, they were located all the way to the Bay Street bridge! Mike 1 started the encounter at 1644 as Mark went under the Johnston Street bridge and saw the T109A's prey sharing near the gravel yard at Bay Street. Numerous gulls hovered over them as they finished their seal snack. The group of seven then swam back underneath the Johnson Street bridge, and once they made it to the Harbor Air seaplane dock, they stormed underneath the dock after another seal. After several minutes of chasing it inside the seaplane dock next to the terminal, they chased it back under the dock to the outside and eventually caught it. The entire group was logging at the surface after carrying it within view of the large crowd of onlookers standing in awe along the inner harbour causeway by the Steam Ship Terminal. They dove for several minutes while they tore apart their prize as a slick formed, and the gulls reappeared, hovering above them with hopes of some crumbs left behind. The whales then exited the harbour with a few surfacing as they passed the lineup of onlookers at Laurel Point, went into a long dive and made it past the fuel dock to the edge of the outer harbour before surfacing for the next breath cycle.

With overcast skies and light rain starting, they pushed on as the sea conditions were decent, with little wind and flat seas. At ~ 1030, as Mike 1 approached Magdellena Point, Mark could see several humpback whales in the mist ahead. He started to work through the aggregation of what appeared to be close to 50 animals to get some tail fluke identification pictures. They were spread over several miles from within a mile of the shoreline to five miles offshore and as far west as Sombrio Point. Within a few minutes of being on scene, the skies opened up and they were now in a torrential downpour! Mark could barely keep his camera dry by cowering under the enclosed T-top and shooting out either side when an opportunity arose. He got close to twenty individuals photographed before he got word that some Bigg's killer whales were spotted south of Race Rocks working their way northwest. He then received report of another group spotted near Port Angeles headed northwest. At ~1200, Mark decided to make his way back towards the east towards clearer skies and the killer whales that he had unfortunately missed on his westward quest. At 1235, he got word that the group seen just south of Race Rocks were last seen moving quickly west along the shoreline of East Sooke Park at the west edge of Becher Bay. They were reported doing 6 knots, so Mark calculated that he would come across them near Secretary Island when he arrived at ~1300. At 1259, he spotted the blows tight against the shoreline at Possession Point inside Secretary Island. It was a group of 5 individuals, the T109s: T109, a 46-year-old female with her ten-year-old son, T109E, and her 16-year-old daughter, T109D, with two offspring of her own. They were on a mission as they continued along the kelp line close to shore, maintaining 6 knots towards the entrance to Sooke Harbor. They rounded Whiffin Spit and made their way through the channel to the docks at the Prestige Hotel before turning around and retracing their steps out of the harbor, surprisingly without any signs of predation. They continued along the kelp line to the west, and off the Sooke Bluffs T109 stalled out as if she were stalking a seal. After several minutes of T109 milling around in the kelp forest while the others were stalled out nearby, the family continued to the west until it appeared they finally flushed the initial seal or another one out of the dense kelp forest. It was then apparent that they finally had some lunch!

As the team continued west, they saw several more blows, and realized there were two groups of killer whales in the channel. The team started with the more northern group of three individuals. After a single distant pass, the whales took a deep dive, so the team decided to head towards the larger group to the south. It was only after reviewing the photos later in the office that the team IDed this first group of whales as the T28As. While the team saw the whales continue east along the north side of Spieden, they never re-acquired this group after moving to the more southernly whales. The southern group of whales turned out to be the T36As. This group hugged the southern shoreline of Spieden Channel, before briefly turning south when they entered San Juan Channel. After one sequence, they made a big turn and started heading north towards Flat Top. The team followed along, and the whales briefly sped up, porpoising north. As they neared Flat Top, the whales slowed down, and it became clear they were chasing a harbor porpoise. The team watched as the whales cornered the porpoise, knocking it into the air before presumably making the kill. T36A1, T36A1A, and T36A5 stayed offshore while the other whales went in shore, checking out a few coves presumably looking for more prey items. The whales then continued northwest.

When they did, after around 10 minutes and two subsequent breath sequences, they managed only to split the group into pairs and apparently lost interest after a few animated pounces. This behaviour continued for the next 30 minutes, with the group chasing two more large rafts of sea lions. Though they successfully separated each into pairs or trios, the whales ultimately regrouped and proceeded east toward Race Rocks. No successful predation was observed, and the killer whales never honed in on an individual sea lion.

Within a few minutes, it was apparent that they succeeded as T060F spyhopped with the hind flippers of a harbour seal in her grip. The group of nine passed it around amongst each other before T109D finally put it out of its misery. They all continued eastward along the Vancouver Island shoreline as far as Race Pass before crossing over to Race Rocks Ecological Reserve. The hundreds of hauled-out sea lions, mainly Stellers, along with a few California sea lions, were very agitated with their foe's arrival. Their growls and barks increased in intensity as they watched the black fins parade past their haul out. Many of them collectively stormed into the water in an offensive defence strategy. As it was getting dark, Mark ended the encounter at 1943 after watching the group loop around the southwest corner of Great Race and head north along the Ecological Reserve's eastern edge.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-53

The reports made it seem like they were probable southern residents but water conditions were sloppy where the whales were. As the whales made their way back up Haro Strait, they were identified by observers on shore as K pod. The seas were calming down some although the water on the west side was still a little lumpy. When the whales had made it to Hannah Heights, Michael and Dave met down at Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1650. We arrived on scene a little north of Lime Kiln and the encounter began at 1705. K pod was spread out and the leaders appeared to be K27, K12, and K37. K37 chased a fish off Bellevue Point before he continued north past the county park by himself. Behind the leaders was a small group that included K20, K45, K36, and K43. This group began porpoising north past CWR. Offshore and a little south of these whales, K16 and K35 were traveling north together. Further offshore and south of these two, we found K26 and K42 spread out and heading up Haro Strait. K26 was traveling fairly quickly. By this time, we had found everybody in K pod but the K22s and one or two others. There were several whales tucked deep in Mitchell Bay so we headed over toward the south tip of Kellett Bluff. Here we found K33 foraging in the tide rip south of Kellett Bluff while K22 was with K45 a couple hundred yards to the northwest traveling slowly north off Kellett. These two split up off the north end of the bluff. K20 and K38 came up from the south and K45 joined them. K33 was traveling by himself inside of this threesome. K22 showed up and she and K33 traveled north together loosely spread out.

This group was the J35s and J31s, taking very long down times but staying close enough to the surface to observe with the drone. After staying in travel mode for about 15 minutes, the whales found a large school of fish at the surface at 10:05, which seemed to cause a behavior switch. The whales spread out and began milling, apparently searching for targets as they neared Pile Point. Within half an hour, the team observed their first capture of the day, and J47 and J57 chased a fish very close to shore off Pile Point. J47 made the final capture, and shared half the fish with his younger brother. The same pair made another capture just ten minutes later. J56 also had luck finding fish to chase. After capturing one, she spent several minutes trying to break it in half. As her mom J31 approached, the younger whale was finally able to saw the fish in half and share part of it with her mom. Other whales started to move into the area, including J38, J39, J51, and J44. As these whales started searching for their own targets, J31 and J56 chased a fish to the surface and played with it for a few minutes. J31 finally broke it in half and ate it, but we didn't see J56 come back for the other half, apparently distracted by other fish to chase. The whales started finding more large schools at the surface. J31 broke one up, but didn't seem able to pick a single target to chase down. J38, J53, and J45 briefly corralled another school, causing the fish to flee to deeper water, with the two males in pursuit. J38 moved further inshore to meet up with his mother J22. There, the two of them managed to capture and share a salmon. Offshore, J56 had made another kill and was spending a lot of time playing with the remains of the fish, only stopping to chase another school of fish at the surface. Even further offshore, J39 continued to chase fish, but we didn't see him capture any. Meanwhile, J38 continued to chase fish at the surface, with at least one more successful capture. Around 12:30, the whales' behavior started to shift. While the adult males continued to chase fish on their own, younger whales and females began to group up and be a bit more social. Four young whales, J53, J57, J58, and J59 socialized while J35 and J47 swam nearby. J53 and J58 were apparently still hungry, as they briefly broke off from this group to chase another fish at the surface, eventually having to dive after it when it made an escape to deeper water. The team moved down island towards Eagle Point, where J39 had moved off to forage on his own. While they saw him initiate one fish chase, he didn't seem to be having too much luck catching anything. Further up island, another small social group had formed, composed of the J41s, J42, and J53. J42 and J53 mostly socialized with each other, while the J41s swam in near constant contact. J19 arrived from up island and joined up with her daughter and grandkids, but stayed peripheral to the more energetic socializing the kids were engaged in.

T69 was on the periphery, just a little behind the others. There was no sign of T69E and T69F but we had heard that one or two whales had been seen southwest of Kelp Reef earlier. These whales were reported to be taking extremely long dives and were not showing much of themselves at all. The T36As and T69s that we were seeing zagged to the east a couple of times but were generally heading south-southeast toward Discovery. T36A5 and T36A1A chased a pigeon guillemot for a couple minutes, taking swats at it but not too seriously trying to catch it. The whales passed Zero Rock on its east side and continued in a southerly direction in Cordova Bay. The T36As and T69C stalled out during a long dive while T69F showed up and joined T69 to the south of the others. After another long dive, the T36As had passed up T69 and T69F and were now heading southeast around Gordon Head. T69C was a little behind the T36As. Since the whales were heading down the southeast coast of Vancouver Island too close to shore to get on the good light side, we decided to call it quits. As we were leaving the scene, three whales showed up over a mile behind the T36As and T69C. This was T69 and T69F again but T69E had finally showed up and joined them. These three were traveling slowly southeast in a loose group. They were not going much of anywhere while on their long dives.

They decided to head out and get some drone footage before the wind was forecasted to pick up later in the afternoon. After getting off the dock at 11:09, the team found a small group of whales in the middle of Haro Strait, directly between Landbank and Discovery Island. This group was K14, K26, and K42, heading southwest. After IDing the whales, the team decided to head east to see if they could find groups closer to shore where the water would be more conducive to aerial observation. After seeing J16 and J26 offshore of False Bay, the team found a small group of whales near Eagle Point. The team launched the drone, and began observation of this spread out group composed of J35, J44, J46, and J57. The whales were headed south towards Hein Bank. J44 and J53 socialized while J57 goofed around near his mom. After following this group for half an hour, the team moved offshore towards a larger group of active whales. There they found the K20s, along with K36. K20 had apparently just caught a fish and shared half with K38. K45 spent some time investigating kelp mats, seemingly very comfortable swimming away from mom for an extended period of time. In general, the whales seemed to be spread out and in foraging mode, with the team able to see many more whales than those they were able to get the drone over. All of the whales seemed to be moving south, following the western edge of Hein Bank. Further south, the team found K33 milling near the surface. As the team watched, K22 swam in from the north with a salmon in her mouth, which she broke in half to share with K33. The team found the L94, L113 and L127 socializing with J35 and J57. L113 was playing babysitter for L127 for much of the time, while L94 was presumably off searching for fish. J57 and L127 were both very active at the surface and social with one another. Nearby, J27, J31, and J56 travelled with J40. Like the other young whales we saw that day, J56 was very surface active, performing several breaches.

We spent about ten minutes getting both left and right side ID shots on these two when another whale surfaced about a half mile to the north near Pile Point. We went over there and this was L54. L108 also surfaced nearby. Both whales were pointed up island and began spreading out with L54 being inshore and several hundred yards ahead of L108. L54 breached a couple of times before she and L108 came back together and both pointed offshore. We then went southwest about a quarter of a mile to take another look at L88 and L117 again. We got some more good lefts on these two before deciding to go on a little whale search. The L12s had last been seen going south the previous evening so there was a chance they were in Haro Strait somewhere. We departed the area and headed south toward Hein Bank. We made it down to Hein Bank without seeing anything so we headed northeast toward Salmon Bank. There were a couple small bird balls near the Salmon Bank buoy but no minkes or other orcas showed up. Since it looked like no other whales besides the L54s and L88 were around, we decide to head toward home with one last look at the four whales present on the way. After our hour long whale search, we made it back on scene around 1345. L88 was now heading southeast by himself off False Bay. We stayed with him for one series of surfacings before he arched big for us and we then moved on to the others. The L54s were about a third of a mile to the north of L88.

Sure enough, they were sighted from shore on the morning of 18-Aug-2023 off of Eagle Point, spread out and foraging. The team got off the dock at 13:38 and headed down island. They found the whales about a mile offshore of American Camp at 14:13. When the team got there, the whales had grouped up, lazily socializing in flat calm water. The team quickly got the drone in the air and began aerial observations. Most of the youngsters, L121, L124, and L126, along with L126's mom L119, were socializing in a big, swirling group, while the older whales, L25, L22, L85, and L77, rested nearby and L94 and L127 socialized nearby. L119 pushed L126 around on her rostrum while L124 and L121 chased each other. After a few minutes, the whales formed up and went on a deep dive. When the whales surfaced again, they were formed into a single group, moving slowly in an arc towards the northwest before diving again. They continued this pattern, with the younger whales socializing on the periphery, for a few sequences. During this period, L124 rolled over, letting us finally confirm that she's female. The two youngest whales, L126 and L127, also took some time to chase each other around while the adults rested. On one surfacing, L121 and L124 found a fish at the surface. The two young whales proceeded to half-heartedly pursue the fish at the surface, clearly playing and practicing. At several points, the fish swam into one of their open mouths only for the whales to let the fish go. Eventually the fish was so disoriented and exhausted that the whales resorted to just pushing it back and forth between each other. After several minutes, L124 clamped down on the fish, carrying it with her as she swam to catch up with the rest of the group. The whales spread out and headed up island. L124 continued to practice dropping and recatching her fish, while L121 socialized with L22 and L25. This group eventually caught up with the L94s, who had been in the lead as they whales moved north. The whales grouped up again as they passed Hannah Heights.

They paused for a scan at the west entrance to the Pass, but feeling the strong ebb current decided it was unlikely that the animals had made it so far, and continued west. Shortly after they had accelerated and moved offshore of the sport fishing fleet around Whirl Bay and Church Point, they spotted a small cluster of killer whale spouts against the Bedford Islands. They slowed and began the encounter at 0855. With the number of whales visible, the guys thought it likely that the Southern Residents were making their long-awaited return to the Salish Sea. Sure enough, sprouting male K42 was the first individual photographed, apparently socializing with J47 and another individual. Mark and Joe made their way to a mix of J and L pod which seemed to be the northeastern-most group of inbound animals. The whales passed through the kelp at Church Rock before stalling in Whirl Bay to socialize. Several spyhops and breaches ensued, before they eventually collected themselves and carried on east toward Christopher Point. Individuals present included many or all of the J14s, J16s, J17s, J22s and L55s. Two large, tight groups trailed them offshore, with scattered individuals and pairs spread out in between. Mark and Joe worked their way southwest, documenting the bulk of K pod along the way – including young K45 and mother K20 – before meeting the southernmost group, with included the extended L12 subgroup, L72 and L105, and L83 and L110. L85 was travelling alongside L22, as he had been each time they were encountered off the outer Washington Coast in July, and both of the youngest L pod calves were present and energetic. The whales were now approaching Race Rocks, and the bulk of the spread Ks had joined most of J pod at the northwest edge of the park, while the large L12-plus group aimed straight into the main channel inside Race Rocks. They turned out of the strong current just before reaching Great Race Rock and passed through the park near North Race Rocks instead (i.e. northeast bound for Victoria). Mark and Joe sat idle in Race Pass as the whales pushed past the reserve, documenting the trailing J11s and J19s just ahead of L87, who was in turn just ahead of the remaining L4s (L86s, L55). They ended the encounter there at 1040, having confirmed the presence of 55-60 individuals, including K37, the only one missing from CWR’s recent West Coast survey.

The aerial observation team arrived on scene at 13:54 in the middle of Haro Strait, east of Discovery Island. The whales were in a few tight groups, moving east fast. The team started a focal follow on one large group, consisting of members of the J16s, J14s, J22s, and L55s. The whales were very active and social as they quickly made their way to the west side of the island, headed towards Pile Point. They eventually made a turn to the left, heading up island. The whales spread out a bit and began foraging; J39 foraged offshore of the group, and L118 also broke off from the main group to catch a fish, which she brought back to the surface. The group was soon joined by K43 and K27 as they moved lazily up island. After a few flights, the team switched to another group a bit further north. This group turned out to mostly be adult and sprouter males: J27, K35, K42, L116, and L106 were all together, with K16 and J40 nearby. K35 linked up with his mother K16 and the two of them broke off, while J27, K42, and L116 continued to socialize.

North of Lime Kiln they found the K22s and the J35s socializing on their way north. After a couple flights with this group, Dave radioed and told Michael that two large groups had formed off Open Bay.

After packing up the truck and saying farewell to Joe who was driving back to Victoria, Dave, Mark and Fin departed the Port Renfrew Hotel dock on Mike 1 at 0845. They decided to take advantage of the perfect conditions and head back out to see if the Southern Residents were still in the area. With almost no swell and zero wind they made it to the Cloo-ose grounds south of Nitinat within the hour. After a quick binocular scan they pushed south west passing numerous sport fishing boats at the edge of Swiftsure Bank as they continued towards the area they saw the Residents foraging the day before. They immediately heard calls with the hydrophone upon arrival, this time very faint. After another binocular scan with no sign of any dorsal fins on the horizon they continued south for a few miles before stopping for another listen and scan. The calls were marginally louder but mainly because the previous tanker transiting through the area was well clear of them. They continued their south track and were now well south of where they had left them the day before but figured they were likely heading the right way as that is the direction they had seen them heading. Sure enough! Mark spotted a couple flashes on the horizon which screamed killer whales and eventually Dave and Mark saw distant dorsal fins approaching them. The first whales they saw were a loose group that included J39, L83, and the L91s. These were the three L pod whales they could not find the day before so the encounter was off to a good start. L110, L115, and the J35s were also milling in the general area. The Mike 1 crew then moved a little further to the southwest to another group of whales. This was another loosely spread group of whales including the L72s, the L103s, L87, and L118 all moving northerly at the time. Afterward, L108 slowly passed them followed by L54 and L117 charging northeast. Ahead of them, a large group was forming that included most of the L4s, L72s, L87, L90, and L88. This group was tight together and moving very slowly in an easterly direction. L88 and the L54s dropped back to mill and forage to the west of this group. When Dave and Mark were done photographing the large group of Ls finishing with the L54s and L88, they moved on to the next largest group of whales they could find. This was the J22s, K14s, and K16s in a tight group mostly pointed east. More whales began appearing from the south, mainly the L12s, J11s, J16s, along with J40 and J45. These whales were spread out in singles and small groups. While most of the whales appeared to be heading north, nobody seemed to be heading in any one direction for very long. They ended the encounter at 1306 with L85 as he traveled northwest in a straight line while surfacing regularly-being extremely cooperative. Mark and Dave both share a soft spot for L85 and as tough as it was tough to leave the whales in such incredible conditions it was unanimous to end the encounter with him.... not to mention they still had a long boat ride back to Victoria ahead of them!",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-37

The weather and swell had improved significantly from the day before and the trio were optimistic that killer whales were in their future. After finding only harbour porpoise in the Clo-oose grounds, they turned offshore toward Swiftsure Bank, using the favourable sea direction to push well south. An hour later the team was nearing Table Rock, along the outer Washington coast, with not a single cetacean to show for their efforts. Still hopeful, they eased into a southeast swell for another twenty minutes before slowing to rest for a moment. A hydrophone drop was suggested, and instantly upon placing it into the seemingly empty, grey Pacific a chorus of Southern Resident killer whale vocals rang out through the amplifier! The sounds coming through the small amplifier were crisp and clear, so loud that the research team was at a loss as to why they could not see any whales! As they considered next steps, Joe took a moment to relieve himself off the back of the boat and almost immediately spotted the a quickly moving group of 10-12 killer whales just 0.5 nm off the port quarter of Mike 1. They began the encounter with members of L4 and L12 matrilines at 1125. L116, sporting some new rakes near the base of his left-side saddle patch, and L82 alongside L113 were among several animals charging south-southeast. L94 and the youngest Southern Resident, L127, were nearby, as were L109 and L55. L25, L22 and L85, the latter two travelling shoulder-to-shoulder, were next to appear, and it soon became clear that the spread of L pod killer whales was converging, no longer trending south. Shortly, L87 joined the fray and the L12s, the L54s – including L88 and L117, who had been missing the previous day – and most of the remainder of L pod came together and faced south, holding at the surface, and vocalizing audibly for several moments. In the distance ahead of the Ls, the Mike 1 crew could see many more animals, far too many to be just the remainder of L pod, and assumed that other SRKW were present. They departed the L pod meeting and ventured approximately a half nautical mile south to find several J and K pod animals! A mélange of K12s, 13s and 14s were the first small group encountered, just before J47 appeared, near a young animal, presumably J57. A quickly growing J45 surfaced next, the animals now loosely spread and foraging, somewhat successfully if the scraps being pulled from the surface by the accompanying albatross and shearwaters were any indication. The K14s, sans K36, and the K16s joined the J22s for a little while, and between social behaviour at the surface, also worked their way south. Not wanting to get pulled much farther down the coast, the Mike 1 team decided to turn north to pick up any trailing animals before heading for home. They documented J41 and J51 travelling alongside an exuberant J58, and visually confirmed several more J pod individuals before ending the encounter at 1350 , with the entire clan still trending south some 15 nautical miles offshore of Cape Flattery.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/20223-36

Steady two to three metre swells made the going slow, but they reached Carmanah Point by ~1100. Just shy of the Nitinat Narrows, Joe spotted a gray whale, which turned out to be three animals feeding inside the kelp off Dare Point. After documenting the largest – and the only individual outside of the shore break – they decided to push offshore with a good angle along the swell toward Swiftsure Bank. Moments after turning 90° to port, Mark spotted a single killer whale fin ahead. Just one nautical mile south of the Nitinat Bar, Dave confirmed Southern Resident killer whale L108 was moving southeast, parallel to the Island. They paced the now-sprouted bull for a few minutes, in hopes of finding the remainder of his L54 matriline and their constant companion, L88, and were rewarded after a few minutes when he made a sharp turn inshore to meet the matriarch L54 as she successfully chased down a salmon. After a quick prey share, the two continued to forage in the area for a little while, and the Mike 1 team moved off and attempted to spot the yet unaccounted for L88 and L117. Unsuccessful, they confirmed that L54 and her eldest were apparently non-directional and foraging in the area, before ending the encounter just a mile west of where it had begun and moved off toward the Bank in search of more.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-35

The Js had been up in Georgia Strait for a few days while the L12s were on the south side of San Juan Island, and the team was interested in checking in on J36, who looked extremely pregnant last time they observed her on the drone. The team got off the dock at 1858 and quickly found the whales, starting their encounter at 1907 as the whales headed south along the Henry Island shoreline. The whales were initially fairly spread out and moving quickly. The first whales the team identified were L25 and L85, making it clear that the L12s had met up with J pod north of San Juan Island and were now travelling with them. As they moved south, the whales slowed down and grouped up, becoming much more social. Two to three main groups of mixed L12s and Js began socializing, exhibiting lots of surface active behaviors. As the team surveyed the groups, it became clear that J36 was not present in these subgroups. The team saw a single whales very far inshore of the main groups, and thought it was likely that this was J36. The team caught up with her near the San Juan shoreline south of Mitchell Bay. J36 took a close pass on Orcinus, allowing the team to get clear photos of her and see that she still did not have a new calf, before peeling off shore and heading for the main group of whales. The team followed her back out to the main groups. Having met their main objective, the team turned towards documenting the last few whales in the group. Additionally, with all the socializing going on, the team thought they might be able to get a shot of L126 rolling over to confirm the new calf's sex. L25 and L85 led the way, with the rest of J pod and the L12s mixed up behind them. Groups of young males socialized on the periphery while the females and calves swam together, treadmilling against the flood tide. The team quickly found L119 and L126 and stuck with them for a few minutes. L126 rolled over multiple times, but not at an angle that allowed us to get a sex shot. Finally, while rolling around on his mom's rostrum, L126 rolled at the right angle to let the team confirm that he's a male.

Further south, the team identified L77 travelling by herself. The team moved inshore near Kanaka Bay, finding J47, J46, J31, and J56 spread out and apparently foraging. After briefly documenting these animals, the team moved towards Pile Point where they found L94, L113, and new calf L127.

The calf was being very social with its mom and sister, spending a lot of time rolled over on top of other whales. We managed to get a few shots of the calf's underside which appeared to show that it was female, but we would need further images to solidly confirm.

He photographed L25 and L85 along with a few J pod whales, confirming that at least J pod and the L12s made their way in. The team decided to leave early the next morning to catch up with the whales. A report of the whales going north through Active Pass early in the morning meant the team left Snug at 800 and headed north. The team conducted a long search of southern Georgia Strait, starting near Point Roberts, then north to the mouth of the Fraser, and then across the strait towards Active Pass. While they found a pair of humpbacks, they didn't have any visual or acoustic contact with the residents and decided to refuel at Pt. Roberts. As the team was refueling, they received a report of SRKW just east of Pt Roberts, heading their way. They left the harbor and almost immediately saw fins, starting their encounter at 1214. The first two whales the team found were L22 and L25, travelling and foraging together with the J22s nearby. Further offshore, the team found a group of socializing whales and saw that there was a very small calf in the group. The calf was initially associated with L113, but not synchronizing with her or staying in the echelon position. After getting a few photos, it became clear to the team that this was not the same calf that was observed with the L12s off Tofino several days earlier. The J35s approached L113 and the calf from behind, and J26 made a pass by before continuing on his way. The J35s were being very social, and eventually L113 mixed in with J47 and J57. Soon, L94 met up with the group and the calf immediately fell in along side her, staying in echelon position and synchronizing with her surfacing pattern, leading the team to suspect that L94, rather than L113, was the calf's mother. The team stayed with the group (including J44 who joined up a few minutes later) long enough to get photos of everyone, and especially dorsal and eyepatch photos of the new calf. The team decided to see if they could go find the calf that was documented off Tofino, and that they'd try to re-locate this calf before the end of the day to see which female it stayed associated with. The team headed further offshore and found a large, social group of whales composed of the J16s, J19s, J39, L77s, J39, and L121. The group was very surface active, with lots of spyhops, breaches, and percussive behaviors. Sure enough, there was another young calf sticking solidly alongside L119. This calf's eyepatch and dorsal fin were a match for the calf photographed off Tofino. As this calf was documented first, we decided to designate it L126, and the other calf L127. The calf was the center for attention for a lot of the socializing, with the other young whales in the group showing a lot of interest. The calf got rolled around a lot, but we weren't able to get a confirmation of its sex, but we were able to see that L126 appears to have an open saddle patch. We stuck with the group to get ID photos, and observed L85 following behind at a distance. After several minutes, we broke off from the group and got photo documentation of L85. We soon broke off from L85 and went looking for L127 again, to see whether the calf was associating with L94 or L113. On the way, we found J44, J46, and J53 as well. We soon located the calf again, and it was still solidly travelling with L94, sticking tightly to echelon position while L113 stuck off to the side. At this point, the team was confident that L94 was the calf's mother. Behind these whales, L85 and J26 briefly joined up and socialized together. The group was soon joined by L25, J31, J56, J35, and J57 as they moved down the strait. The team decided to call it a day and head off, taking one more pass of L94 and L127 before ending the encounter at 1600.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-31

Mark and Dave headed down to Snug Harbor and left on Mike 1 after 1030. We arrived on scene off Clover Point and the encounter began at 1109. There was a large tight group in the lead as they headed east into slightly lumpy seas. This group consisted of the J19s, J22s, and the J37s (minus J45). A couple hundred meters behind them was a group of five that included the J31s, J27, J39, and J45. The rear group caught up to and merged somewhat with the lead group by 1030 but the whales had split up some by the time they passed the south tip of Trial Island. Over a quarter mile southeast of these whales, we found all three of the J35s traveling east in a tight group. We then moved back toward Trial Island to see if we could find some of the J pod whales that we hadn’t seen yet as it was apparent that J pod were the only whales here. We found our original whales back near the south end of Trial Island, but it didn’t look like the whales we were looking for were there, so we moved back to the southeast. We then found a loose threesome that included J44, J46, and J53. At this point, we had found and photographed everyone in J pod except for all four of the J16s. We moved inshore towards the southwest corner of Discovery Island and found J16, J26, and J42 loosely spread out and heading east toward Seabird Point. J19 and J39 were ahead of the J16s. All the whales pointed northeast and spread out into singles and smaller groups as they traveled toward San Juan Island. We ended the encounter at 1249 a couple of miles east of Seabird Point right on the US/Canadian border.

T63 and T65 were loosely spread out and following the T36As and T124As by about fifty yards. T87 moved over to the Lopez shoreline and T65 joined him a little later. Around 1705, after we had dropped back a little to get photos of T63, the T36As and T124As began porpoising south. They stalled out down toward the bottom of Griffin Bay far ahead of us. After we got shots of T63, we had planned to wait until the whales were out of Cattle Pass before we approached for more photos. However, the whales were fighting the flood and took quite a while to go anywhere once they were north of the pass. A large chunk of the T36As and/or the T124As milled a bit and began heading back north after a long dive. We went to see who that group was when they went on another extremely long, long dive. We waited around for almost ten minutes when a whale finally surfaced to the southwest of us. However, this whale’s fin was too big to be part of the group we had been waiting for. It turned out to be T124C who was following the others. T124C had been reported to have been present earlier in the day. T124C headed southeast but was only coming up once every half minute or more so he was hard to pace for ID photos. The group of females and kids who had been heading north finally surfaced again to the south of us closer to Cape San Juan. They continued on southeast towards Whale Rock. T63 and T65 appeared to the south of us, between the T36As/T124As group and us. These two then briefly headed back north towards T124C and T87, who had also recently reappeared. These four then all turned back south and headed for the pass as a group, heading down the east side of Goose Island. By 1815, the T36As and T124As had exited Cattle Pass and were heading east-southeast off Long Island. This group was still tight together and we were able to get some nice right sides on them before leaving them around 1840 still heading east-southeast about a mile south of Long Island. The T63, T65, T87, and T124C group had spread out a little and taken a more south-southwest direction out of Cattle Pass and were briefly heading for the Salmon Bank buoy. By the time we headed over to them, they had reformed into a foursome and also headed east-southeast. T63, T65, T87, and T124C were looking quite impressive in the evening light as they lined up abreast and were steaming easterly in lumpy tidal waters. We ended the encounter with them at 1904 about 2 miles southwest of Long Island.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-20

Moments later, he saw the two large fins on the horizon passing through Mayor Channel abeam the Oak Bay Beach Hotel and his apartment.
The flood current was racing northward through Oak Bay, and when Mark finally re-sighted the trio again at 1315, they were well ahead of him, entering Baynes Channel at 1315. They were doing close to 9 knots over the bottom with 4 or 5 breaths followed by a short “long” dive of around three minutes. Once he got a few left and right shots of each whale, Mark ended the encounter after 11 minutes at 1326, just north of Ten Mile Point light.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-19

The south wind against the ebb current made for slow going but Mike 1 arrived with the spread grouping at 1148. He saw T063, T065, T065A2, T125A, and T128 milling about a quarter mile to the west of the others, who were also milling about with lots of direction changes.
Mark got word that Joe and 4Ever Wild had confirmed that T023 and the T023Ds were present; the rest of the T065As and the T065Bs made up the rest of the gang. Prior to his arrival, all of the animals had been milling together in the area for nearly an hour but were now beginning to disperse slightly. While Mark sat patiently waiting for opportunistic identification shots of the animals as they milled about in the choppy water, he spotted a bull nearly 0.75 nm to the north moving quickly northbound. He decided to leave the group to confirm which bull it was and assumed the rest would eventually follow him. Once Mark got abeam of the animal, he confirmed it was T125A. Cruising at a steady 8 knots north and with no sign of any others following suit, Mark decided to end the encounter at 1248 and head toward Oak Bay, and yet another group of Bigg’s were reported coming in from the west passing between Trial Island and the Victoria Golf Club in Enterprise Channel.
Note: Later, reports from the commercial whale-watch fleet reported that the large pod had split into three separate northbound groups from Middle Bank. T125A and T128 travelled northwest across Johnstone Reef to Cordova Channel alone, T065 led her kin (T063, the T065As, and the T065Bs) up San Juan Island’s western shoreline until they too split at Kellett Bluff, Henry Island, and the T023s made their way through the San Juans via Cattle Pass and Upright Channel before emerging into Rosario Strait near Obstruction Island by early evening.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-18

Mark skipped breakfast and mobilized Mike 1, departing Victoria Harbour at 0900. He caught up to the group at 0925, 1.5 nm southwest of Kelp Reef. He immediately recognized T002C1 and could see the other three members of the family were present, along with what appeared to be at least another matriline of 5 or 6 whales with a fairly young calf. The group was fairly close together, heading towards the Kelp Reef marker, and with consultation from Joe, was able to confirm that dispersee T065A5 was with them along with the T023Cs. Mark could see T023C had a fairly new calf and got confirmation that she had indeed been seen in the Broughton Archipelago with a new one on April 24th.
As they passed Kelp Reef, the group split into their respective matrilines, with the T002Cs paralleling the T023Cs and the young male T065A5 a half mile to the west of them, closer to the Darcy Island shoreline. At 1053 Mark ended the encounter off the south end of Sidney Island as he felt he had collected sufficient pictures of the group, especially of the new addition to the T023Cs. Ten minutes after he left the whales, reports from commercial whale-watch boats on-scene were that he missed a double harbour porpoise kill! Mark continued south toward Middle Bank, where a group of 18 Bigg’s had been reported milling.

Dave chatted with Mark on the phone after Mark’s encounter 17 with the T2Cs, T23Cs, and T65A5 on the Canadian side of Haro Strait. There was a newish calf with T23C that colleagues of ours wanted more confirmation photos of. Mark got rights of the calf before he left but thought there might be an opportunity for Dave to get lefts afterwards. Dave then headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1230. Most of the whales had had been reported to have made their way over toward Danger Shoals but the T2Cs had apparently disappeared in Haro Strait. “Orcinus” made it on scene by 1300 as the whales headed east in New Channel in a tight group. The whales had been on a lengthy long dive prior to arrival and finally surfaced near the shoreline off the northeast end of Spieden Island right around the corner from Green Point. Dave got one pass on the T23Cs and T65A5 and got a couple “just good enough” left eyepatches on the calf before they went on another long dive. When they surfaced again, they had zagged several hundred yards to the north over towards the west side of Flattop Island. The encounter ended there at 1315.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-17

Dave then headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat around 1050. After topping off at Roche Harbor, Dave took the inside route through Spieden Channel, down San Juan Channel, then up Wasp Passage and through Harney Channel. Heading for Peavine Pass, it got a little lumpy with the breeze coming out of East Sound but Rosario Strait ended up being really calm. After exiting Peavine Pass, “Orcinus” headed down the east shoreline of Blakely Island and finally arrived on scene at 1225 mid-Rosario Strait just north of the ferry route between Anacortes and Thatcher Pass.

There was a large number of milling of whales heading slowly north in one loose group. The front part of the group was fairly tight but there were many whales lagging a little behind them. There was lots of splashing and rolling from the younger whales and it was soon obvious that this was a large social gathering. Young whales were falling out of the water all over the place, often while vocalizing in the air. The group consisted of the T36As, T65As (minus T65A5), T75Bs, T99s, T123s, and the T124As (minus the T124A2s), plus T125A and T128. T125A and T128 were near the rear and were taking long dives. When he did appear, T128 appeared to be following T123 around. After an extremely long dive, T125A popped up nearby and began to drift a small ways away from the others. As the front main part of the group continued to roll its was up Rosario Strait, some of the trailers began to spread out slightly. T128 joined T125A and the two of them continued to slowly mill in the general vicinity to the southwest of the main group. Some of the T123s and maybe a couple others also moved a little west of the main group. The T123s, T125A, and T128 eventually moved back toward and were absorbed into the main group. The whales continued up Rosario Strait past Obstruction and Peavine Passes with the calves in the group playing and breaching the whole way. By the time the whales made it to Buoy Bay, the group had broken up some again with the main group including the T36s, T123s, T124As, T125A, and T128 moving closer to the Orcas Island shoreline. As this group moved slowly northeast parallel to the Orcas shoreline and past the Peapod Rocks, the T65As grouped up and paralleled them just on the west side of the Peapods. T65A3, who had been with the larger group closer to the Orcas island shoreline, rejoined his family. The T75Bs and T99s were a hundred yards or so behind the T65As and passed through and to the east of the Peapods.
“Orcinus” moved back to the main group as they approached Lawrence Point. The T123s had drifted off and disappeared but the T36As and T124As were still loosely traveling together with T125A and T128 either mixed in with them or in the general area. The T36A and T124A calves continued to play and breach and squeak as they rounded Lawrence Point. They passed north through a big tide rip with lots and lots of Bonaparte’s gulls off the point. The T65As could still be seen to the northeast of the T36As and T124As. All the whales in sight angled north-northwest as they made it to the Barnes and Clark Islands. The encounter ended at 1608 about a quarter mile east of the north end of Clark Island. The SR3 research vessel “Helen” later reported that all the groups present that day, including the T123s, grouped up again north of Sucia Island in the early evening.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-16

There was also a report of J pod off Fisherman Bay in San Juan Channel. Dave then headed down to the boat and left Snug Harbor in “Orcinus” at 1120. Dave decided to head down the west side of San Juan Island first to see if he could find the whales off Eagle Point. Haro Strait was a little breezy and no whales were found on the way down so “Orcinus” headed through Cattle Pass and up San Juan Channel. J pod was still a little south of Fisherman Bay and the encounter began at 1228. The J11s, J14s, J17s, and J19s were in a tight group moving slowly south. Since J pod appeared to be resting and were not arching enough for good ID photos, Dave stayed for three series of surfacings to make sure all were photographed before deciding to go look for the remaining whales. The J16s were likely the whales seen off Eagle Pt. and they were still out there somewhere in southern Haro Strait. “Orcinus” headed back out of Cattle Pass and searched southwest past Salmon Bank. The seas were a bit lumpy which made sighting things difficult but Dave slogged on to about halfway between Salmon and Hein banks before heading back toward South Beach. After not finding anything, Dave returned to the J pod whales in San Juan Channel by about 1350. J pod had split up some more with the smaller group near Harbor Rock off Cape San Juan. This was the J14s and the J22s, who had shown up from somewhere. The J14s and J22s began some rather intense milling a little east of Harbor Rock. It was unclear whether they were fishing or something else was going on but they eventually moved around Cape San Juan toward Cattle Pass. While this group was milling, the J11s, J17s, and J19s had started coming back from a little ways to the north. They arrived to the same area and, after surfacing from a long dive, also began milling. This was a more relaxed and indecisive milling with several whales briefly logging at the surface. The whales became non-directional and milled about for several series of surfacings. Finally, after a long dive, they committed south and all came up together pointed south out of the pass. The encounter ended there at 1430. After “Orcinus” had left, it was reported that the J16s had shown up off Whale Rock.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-15

In the afternoon, as the fog began to lift, the team heard reports over the radio of a group of whales on the west side, heading north from San Juan County Park. The team ran down to the beach, where they photographed the whales as they swam past very close to shore. The team IDed the whales as the T49As, without T49A1 or T49A2. The team met up at Snug to see if they could get some drone footage of the whales, and got off the dock at 15:24. When the team left Snug, the whales were hunting a seal just outside the harbor in Mitchell Bay. The team launched the drone and observed the whales processing and sharing their kill, before heading north towards Open Bay. The whales picked up speed and rounded Kellet Bluff, heading up Henry Island. They cut inshore of Battleship, taking a moment to rest in a kelp bed before heading east through Spieden Channel. The whales slowly made their way past Barren Island and Davison Head, before taking a turn and heading northeast towards Green Point. The team saw that there were several Steller sea lions on the point, and hoped the whales might attempt a hunt. However, after approaching the south side of Spieden, the whales made a turn and headed back west along the Spieden shoreline, making a few harbor seal kills as they went. As the whales passed Sentinel Rock, the group split, with T49A, T49A3, and T49A6 moving further west while T49A4 and T49A5 hunted together to the east. The trio reached Danger Shoal and then turned back around to meet up with the other two. After meeting back up, the whales headed towards the western tip of Spieden. T49A6 went off on his own back east, before porpoising back towards the rest of the group. As the main group rounded Spieden, they happened upon a seal in the shallows. The whales swiped at the seal and attempted to catch it, but the lucky seal managed to hurl itself out of the water and onto the safety of the rock. T49A6 followed behind a couple minutes later, apparently eager to catch up with the rest of the family. The whales spread out and milled near Spieden Bluff. As the light started to fade, the team ended the encounter at 18:03 and headed home.",27038/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-64

Mark quickly rushed back to Victoria and met Brendon at the dock, and they departed on Mike 1 at 1529. 
The encounter began at 1622 when Mark spotted the first pair of whales east of Secretary Island. Brendon identified these whales as L72 and her son, L105. These two were part of a subgroup of L pod encountered off Monterey Bay, California, along with members of K pod on March 18th. Mark and Brendon soon spotted more fins up ahead and to the south, leading them to believe that more than one pod was present. They decided to work their way ahead to the nearest animals, which proved to be another mother-son pair, L91, and L122. From there, the closest and largest group could be seen several hundred meters to the south, so they ventured over, and Brendon identified two mixed groups: one containing J40, J45, L83, L110, and L115, while the other group consisted of the L4s (minus L55, L109 & L118), J35s and J44. Soon, the two groups merged into one large social band with spy hops and tail-slaps. L115 was noted to be particularly animated and breached three times in quick succession.
After photographing and identifying these animals, Mark and Brendon moved to a small trailing group, which turned out to be J16, J26, and J42. Missing matriline member, J36, was later encountered a couple of hundred meters away alongside J53. 
Mark and Brendon could see more blows to the northeast and a few animals to the southeast, and the decision was made to move to the lead animals, which were identified as the J19s. They could not see any blows ahead of them and concluded that the rest of the unidentified whales in their survey were likely sprinkled throughout the already-observed whales, simply in smaller units. As Mike 1 ventured eastwards, Brendon spotted two more groupings to the southeast. The first group turned out to be a boisterous pairing of J39 and L109. The next set of whales were the J22s and J37s, trailing slightly behind the two sprouting bulls. 
Mark decided to take one last look at a lone whale nearby in the hopes that the animal was not previously identified, and luck was on their side as Brendon identified the female as J46. After a quick proof-of-presence photo, they ended the encounter with the westbound whales south of Sooke at 1745 and began making way for Victoria in a waning southeasterly wind.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-14

About ten minutes later the first whales were found off Kellett Bluff and the encounter began 0940. J22, J41, and J58 were all milling and foraging off the bluff, spread out at first but they eventually came together to mill and possibly share a fish. The SR3 research vessel “Helen” reported that J19 and J40 were several hundred yards north of the whales off the bluff but Dave was never able to make it to them. After J22, J41, and J58 finally moved on toward the north end of Henry Island, there was a big gap between groups heading north. It was over 25 minutes before the next group began rolling around the south end of Kellett Bluff. This was the J31s, J35, J57, and J46. They hugged the bluff before oozing offshore and spreading out a little north of the bird rookery. J46, J56, and J57 remained tight and were socializing as they moved north. J31 and J35 would occasionally move off for brief periods before moving back to the socializing threesome. Once Dave was finished with this group, other whales were hard to find and it was another ten minutes before J27 was spotted more than a half mile west out in the strait. Another whale was several hundred yards to the northwest of J27. This was J44. J27 and J44 once came loosely together briefly before spreading out again as they traveled up Haro. And then whales became really hard to find. The very few whales in sight had already been photographed and more were not materializing. After a heads up almost an hour later about some whales all the way over on the Canadian side south of Gooch Island, that was the next place to go. There were a few spread out whales in the area with J37 and J59 being most obvious. J49 was also around but he soon disappeared. There was another female in the general vicinity of the J37s and this was J16. J16 briefly came tightly together with J37 and J59 as they headed north before moving away again. J42 was also seen in the distance to the north. Reports of whales heading up the Stuart Island shoreline drew Dave back across the strait to the American side. All three of the J35s were encountered in a tight group on the way back across and were at least three quarters of a mile west of Turn Point. J36 was also somewhere in the general area heading north by herself. After another half hour gap between whales, J26 appeared northwest of Turn Point. He actively chased a salmon for about five minutes before catching it and turning back north. About ten minutes later, J27 brought up the rear heading slowly north by himself. All of J pod seemed to have moved north towards Swanson Channel by that point and the encounter ended at 1455 mid-Haro Strait a little south of the south end of Swanson Channel.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-13

The day was pretty breezy out of the southeast but there might be a lee up there so Dave called Katie and they met at Snug Harbor. Leaving the harbor at about 1225, we headed east in the relatively calm Spieden Channel and rounded Green Point which was lumpy with tidal action as expected. The seas were building in San Juan Channel but were relatively calm north of Spieden Channel. We got on scene at 1255 north of the east end of Johns Island. Mark had reported that T19, T19B, the T34s, T37, the T37Bs, and the T49As (minus T49A2) were present and they were in three groups when we got there. The T34s and T37s were in the lead in a tight group heading southeast into what used to be relatively calm seas but was now a 1-2 ft. lump that could get cameras wet. T19B and T49A1 were following the T34s and T37s by about fifty yards. Another group that included the rest of the T49As (minus T49A2 who was not present) and T19 were traveling in the same direction several hundred yards to the north-northwest of the others. As the front group made its way toward the east end of Spieden Island, they turned inshore toward it. We then moved over to get shots of the T49As and T19 group. They continued southeast for a while before they turned east and pointed toward the area north of Flattop Island. This group appeared to be spreading out a little and were perhaps going to begin foraging so we headed back toward the other whales closer to Spieden. T19B and T49A1 were still together and steaming southeast into a stiff breeze. The T34s and T37s had stalled a little and were now behind T19B and T49A1. They were tight and lingering at surface before circling the boat and going on a long dive. The whole group was down for almost seven minutes before surfacing a couple of hundred yards away right on the shoreline of northeast Spieden Island. They were now in hunt mode as two large but scared Steller sea lions immediately hopped out of the water onto the shoreline near the whales. The T34s and T37s then committed to heading toward Green Point. T49A1 and T19B also started charging that direction. The T49As and T19 also reappeared heading back toward Green Point too. All the whales had rounded Green Point by about 1410 and were heading southwest towards the north shoreline of San Juan Island. The T34s and T37s were in the lead again with T19B and T49A1 following. At about 1415, the T34s and T37s began milling like they had something off the San Juan Island shoreline in eastern Spieden Channel. We soon saw they had a Steller sea lion and the attack began. The T19s and T49As must have dropped back further to the northeast into the sloppier seas as we lost track of them while we observed the T34s and T37s attack the sea lion. The T34s and T37s continued to beat up the sea lion in a slightly unspectacular manner for nearly a half hour before subduing it. There was some milling while T37 did a belly flop and there was a big spyhop by another whale. The T34s and T37s then began moving back east toward San Juan Channel so we ended the encounter there at 1450.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-12

He met Brendon at Mike 1, and they left the dock at 0803. While taxiing out of the inner harbour, Mark received another report that the whales had been re-sighted, this time inside the mouth of the outer harbour. Upon rounding the marker at Shoal Point, Mark and Brendon spotted the dorsal fin of a large bull abeam of McLoughlin Point, and the encounter began at 0812.
The first whale to surface was T049C, a 25-year-old bull with a history of visiting Victoria's harbour. Moments later, a sprouter surfaced nearby, and Brendon identified him as T049A2, the 16-year-old nephew of T049C. This pair has been observed traveling together on several occasions in the past and had recently been sighted the day before heading west in the San Juan Islands. 
On March 13th, CWR staff observed T049A2 with his older brother, T049A1, heading north past Ten Mile Point (see Encounter 9)/
Over the course of the next couple of surfacings, the two whales began angling east towards the Ogden Point cruise ship terminal, situated next to Victoria harbour's breakwater. Mike 1 trolled over to join them as a few gulls flocked to the previous location of the whales, suggesting that a successful predation had likely taken place and they were prey sharing as they crossed to the east side of the harbour. T049A2 and T049C briefly investigated the cruise ship terminal before doubling back and rounding the end of the breakwater. T049A2 emerged in a large spyhop once the pair had pushed slightly offshore. The team spotted blood in the water at 0846 and watched as the two whales made short work of a second presumed seal kill. 
After shadowing the whales ~1 nm to the southwest of the breakwater, Mark and Brendon decided to end the encounter at 0857, leaving T049A2 and T049C on a southwesterly track towards Race Rocks.
* The pair were later observed making it slightly northeast of Race Rocks before they turned back towards Victoria harbour, headed east along Victoria's waterfront, and turned north through Oak Bay before turning back south on their reciprocal heading when they were slightly north of Ten Mile Point.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-11

Dave ran down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1245. Mark stuck around long enough for “Orcinus” to arrive on scene off the southwest corner of D’Arcy Island and the encounter started at 1306. T87 and the T124A2s were traveling northwest towards the James Island side of Sidney Channel. They were traveling in a mostly tight formation although occasionally an individual would drift a ways away before coming back. Long dives were usually in the 5-7 minute range. There was one instance of milling off of the southeast side of James Island but it was uncertain whether they got something there. The four whales continued northwest up Sidney Channel on the James Island side. Once north of James Island, the group turned north and traveled in the direction of Moresby Island. The whales passed the tip of Sidney Spit and were approaching the west end of Forrest Island when they went on a long dive. After five minutes or so, T124A2A came up for a few non-directional surfacings by himself. Then he went down again and T124A2 began surfacing by herself. When T124A2 went back down on a long dive, T124A2B began surfacing. T87 surfaced a couple hundred yards to the northwest but he turned around and came slowly back towards where the T124A2s were milling. It was obvious they had a seal pinned on the bottom there. T124A2 charged briefly to the west while T87 did a half breach and followed it up with a tail lob. A kill must have been made as the four whales came back together and began heading north again. While the prey was never seen, there was a strong whiff of blubber oil as they whales passed by (and under) the boat. The foursome seemed to be prey sharing and there was one quick spyhop out of T124A2B. The encounter ended at 1445 as the whales looked like they were angling northwest around the corner of Dock Island. Later, Dave was already back on shore and running errands when he received a report of another group probable Bigg’s heading north off of Lime Kiln. Mark, who was at the end of his afternoon trip, planned to find these whales on his way home. Dave made it to the Snug Harbor parking lot where he read a text from Mark saying he had found the T99s close in to Bellevue Point. Thinking maybe there would be potential for a decent pass-by from the deck, Dave headed to CWR. Dave alerted Kelley and the two of them were talking on the deck while waiting for something to show up. Mark had left already and there no signs of any whales coming. While chatting, Kelley and Dave were distracted by the flop and splash of what we thought might have been a flatfish or rockfish (something brown and fish-like, not a mink) closer to the beach than the reef. Right afterwards, a series of small fluke prints appeared in quick succession pointed away from shore. Then more small fluke prints appeared heading north. Finally, after some moments of confusion over what was happening, a small whale surfaced behind the trees (luckily no leaves yet). This was T99D but his wake was being paralleled by calf-sized fluke prints. It really looked like the youngest members of the T99s may have been chasing a bottom fish. T99 came up nearby T99D heading north while T99B was milling and logging just north of CWR. T99C was further offshore. All the T99s headed north and were out of sight by 1625.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-10

He alerted Joe, and they set out to catch up to the animals on Mike 1. Subsequent reports put the whales through Baynes Channel and traveling north offshore of Ten Mile Point, where Mark and Joe arrived on scene with two bulls approaching the Johnstone Reef marker at 1750. 
They quickly confirmed the two were, in fact, brothers T049A1 and T049A2, who do not often travel with their mother and four younger siblings. As wandering bulls, they are sometimes encountered together and sometimes alone or with other matrilines. Interestingly, T049A2 dispersed much earlier than his elder brother. T049A1’s most recently documented foray into the Salish Sea was with the T124A2 matriline in Puget Sound in February, while T049A2 was last observed here when the pair were together in the Strait of Georgia throughout January.
The two whales were traveling north across Johnstone Reef when Mike 1 reached them and continued on toward Zero Rock throughout the encounter. They averaged five knots and, for 10-12 minutes in the middle of the encounter, were traveling shoulder to shoulder. They passed west of the Zero Rock marker, and with no sign of predation at the frequent seal haul out, Mark and Joe ended the encounter at 1832 and headed for home, the whales still making good time north, now aiming at Sidney Channel.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-09

She saw a large group of killer whales heading southeast and spread out in the Strait of Georgia a few miles northeast of the east entrance to Active Pass. With a logical assumption that it would be J pod with a large spread out group, less than two hours later, at 1018, she confirmed that it was not by spotting all of J pod northbound as they went into Porlier Pass from Trincomali Channel. As Mark got up to speed once he exited Victoria Harbour, he received a report at 1156 that Bigg's were being heard on the SIMRES (Saturna Island Marine Research and Education Society) hydrophone at Saturna Island, so he decided to commit to a search into Boundary Pass to look for them. At 1339 Mark stopped for a binocular scan once he was northeast of Turn Point and spotted several blows and dorsal fins in the middle of Boundary Pass. There were many animals fairly spread out and nondirectional but seemed quite animated, especially the juveniles who were playing with each other and zig-zagging around as the rest of the animals could be seen in several groups making up what looked like well over 20 individuals in total. The first bull that Mark saw looked like T060C but was soon confirmed as the 23-year-old T123A, who has a similar fin shape and almost identical notch in the trailing edge of the top third of his fin. As Mark had seen the T060s a few days ago on March 3, with the T109B's, he had them on his brain! The 21-year-old bull T002C1 also appeared, and a third bull, 31-year-old T124C, was out on the periphery of the aggregation of the animals. The distinctive fin of T037 was seen, so Mark figured the T034's were likely there with the rest of the old gal's team, the T037B's. Soon, T034 paraded past Mike 1 in tandem with the very distinctive nicked-up fin of T099B. T036A1 then appeared with her distinctive nicks in her fin, so the list added up to close to 30 individuals! Four young ones under two years old were in the mix: T002C5, T036A5, T099E, and the newest one, just a few months old, T037B3. Mark decided to end the encounter at 1437 as a couple of the commercial whale watch boats had arrived, and he felt he had proof of presence of all matrilines present. He heard later that the T002Cs had split from the group and were last seen hunting porpoises in San Juan Channel while the rest of the group were generally still milling about in the middle of Boundary Pass. After further review of the roll call, it turned out to be a count of 27 individuals! A true Bigg's Fest.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-08

He met Joe at the boat, and with Fin in tow they departed Victoria just after 0930. As they approached Oak Bay, the crew stopped for a scan and Mark instantly spotted some blows along the north edge of the Chain Islets. The encounter began at 1005 as the whales turned south and passed through the Chain Islets. They were quite animated at the surface, and at first glance it appeared that the bull was T060C and that he and family were travelling with at least one other matriline. Sure enough, photos quickly revealed T002B and the T109Bs! The T109Bs are rare visitors to the Salish Sea, though they are not uncommon in September in recent years. T002B is a wandering female who spends much of her time travelling with the T060 matriline, though she spent most of the ensuing encounter alongside T109B and her youngsters. The whales passed close to Great Chain, but seemed more interested in socializing than foraging. Though it is possible they nabbed a harbour seal against the rocks in the commotion of surface-active behaviour, no obvious predation was observed, nor was there any period of prey-sharing. The animals made their way southwest from the rocks toward Trial Island, where a building flood current left them treading water for the next little while. The youngest three, T060G, T109B4 and T109B5 consistently surfaced ahead of the others after a dive sequence, and were quite playful, while T060C and T060F were together to the eastern periphery of the group for most of the encounter. Mark and Joe dropped back to shadow the animals at a distance for the next 40-50 minutes in hopes of documenting a predation or other behaviour change, but with no sign of any and building southeasterly seas they ended the encounter at noon and headed home. The whales had not yet reached Trial Island, though later reports from commercial whale-watchers placed them nearing Constance Bank by 1400, still meandering southwest.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-07

They turned south from the north shore of Stuart Island and met two young male killer whales travelling north in San Juan Channel, just north of Point Caution at 1443 The two animals were travelling in tandem, slowly tracking up the east shore of San Juan Island, and entered a long dive sequence that lasted nearly eight minutes. When they reappeared, the pair were approaching Rocky Bay, and the Mike 1 crew were able to confirm their identity as T060D and T060E. The teenage brothers have been Salish Sea regulars over the past few years, since they dispersed as a pair from their parent group in summer 2019, and have also been seen along the coast as far north as Prince Rupert and SE Alaska. Now nearly 19 and 15 years old, they are growing quickly; both Mark and Joe noted T060E looking noticeably larger in each of their past two encounters (see Encounter #02) than when the pair were last seen in the region in September 2022. The whales made their way to the junction of San Juan and Spieden Channels before opting to travel west with the strong ebb current toward Roche Harbor or Battleship Island. To that point there had been no sign of predation, but as they passed Limestone Point the pair fanned out, putting perhaps 200 yards between one another in an apparent foraging effort. Spieden Channel itself was full of life, with many gulls, seals and sea lions feasting on baitfish in the strong currents and eddies, and within five minutes the whales had zeroed in on some prey. The predation was clearly successful, and though the guys on Mike 1 were not able to confirm species, a harbor seal seemed probable. The next several minutes saw the two prey-sharing as they plodded on toward Haro Strait, pausing only briefly to forage through the Barren Island kelp before continuing west. Just west of Battleship Island were approximately 60-80 foraging harbor porpoise, but the T060 lads did not seem interested, turning southwest instead, aiming for D’arcy Island or thereabouts.

Thinking it was probably safest to head towards Turn Point, “Orcinus” headed up Haro Strait. Having got to Turn Point without seeing anything in Haro Strait or in lower Boundary Pass, Dave continued north to the bottom end of Swanson Channel to take a scan with binocs up there. After not seeing anything in lower Swanson, Dave headed southeast in the direction of the south end of Waldron Island. Somewhere off Johns Pass, Dave-on a hunch, turned northeast up Boundary Pass. Several minutes later, Dave saw a male killer whale’s dorsal fin mid-channel off Blunden Island and the encounter began at 1208. The bull was J26 and he soon went down on a long dive. No other whales were immediately in sight. After about five minutes, J26 came up a ways to the southeast traveling toward Turn Point. J26 went down on another lengthy long dive before “Orcinus” could get to him. Another adult male showed up several hundred yards to the west of J26. This was J27 and he was paralleling J26’s course. A third adult male appeared another several hundred yards west of J27 and this was J38. Giving up on J26, Dave moved west and, after getting some shots of J27, headed toward a couple of small groups that had appeared on the other side of J38. The first group encountered included the J31s, J36, J40, and J53. This group was rolling around and milling. They may have caught a fish and were doing some sharing while moving in a southwest direction toward Sydney. To the west of this group was another small group that included the J19s minus J58 but plus J42 and J46 (J58 was seen during Encounter #4 on February 19). They were also rolling and milling but headed in a more westerly direction towards Moresby Island before swinging south. The J35s were a couple of hundred yards to the north of this group and they headed south in Haro on the Canadian side. After leaving the J35s across the strait from Turn Point, “Orcinus” headed back east to find some whales that had not been seen yet that day. About mid-strait, J31 and J40 were seen again traveling tight together but this time they were heading back north. Several hundred yards off the bluff on Stuart Island, another female was steaming north and this was J16. A couple hundred yards to her northeast, J45 was actively chasing a salmon off Turn Point. Once he was done chasing the fish, he too began heading north towards Swanson Channel. To the southeast of J45, J27 was slowly heading north by himself.

The SR3 research team were also heading out aboard their boat “Helen” and we coordinated with them throughout the day. They took Boundary Pass up to the Strait of Georgia while we took Swanson Channel and Active pass in case there were any trailing groups of whales. We exited Active Pass at the same time “Helen” was passing by. Since they were faster than us, we let them continue northwest off the Galiano Island shoreline. We headed due north for a ways and then stopped and dropped the hydrophone and took a good scan with binocs. After about 10-15 minutes we got a call on the radio from “Helen” saying they had found whales heading northerly about midway up Galiano Island. We headed that direction and got on scene at 1035. It was J pod and they were very spread out from closer to the Galiano shoreline to mid-Georgia Strait. We first headed toward the biggest concentration of whales we could find which happened to be two individuals spread out by a hundred and fifty yards. One of these whales was J46. Both were foraging and milling while taking some long dives. J27 showed up west of these two and we spent a little time getting a good look at him as he headed slowly northwest up Georgia Strait. J27 still looks a little thin but not nearly as bad as he looked during the Summer of 2022. A smaller whale appeared somewhat nearby J27 and this was J56. A female also showed up to the north of these two. J56 left J27 and joined J31 and the two of them continued northwest. We then worked our way toward mid-strait looking for more whales. J40 and J46 were milling together before they turned north and started charging toward the Frasier River mouth. Several hundred yards from these two was J38 who was also heading north. J22 was paralleling him about three to four hundred yards to the northwest. More whales began appearing and most of them remained spread out and heading north toward the river. We saw J36 and then J37 with J59. J49 was a couple hundred yards north of them. J16 appeared to the north of the J37s and joined J37 and J59. This threesome then began charging toward the river mouth. After getting good photos of these whales, we looked around to see if we could find anymore new whales for the day before it was time to head home. We found J45 by himself angling toward the coal docks. J45 now looks like a sprouter from a distance. To the north of J45, we saw an adult male in the distance. This turned out to be J26 and, after he slid down the length of a tug with a double barge, we got some good shots of him. J26 continues to look robust but he had a lot of peeling skin at the moment. J26 was north of the coal docks and heading south when we saw him. J45 was also last seen pointed south but they could have just been foraging.

He and Joe departed the harbour at 1500, and arrived on scene with two small groups of killer whales at 1520, a few miles southeast of Race Rocks.
The two groups were moving slowly northwest with little conviction and a fair amount of surface activity. T077 and T075B were with a few of their offspring, while T075C, T077C and the rest of the youngsters paralleled them just a hundred meters to the west. The groups are known to visit Port Angeles’ waterfront, and it is likely that at least some of these whales were the ones reported there earlier in the day. The animals were somewhat rambunctious, particularly the youngsters, though no predation was observed. However, a few minutes before the groups merged, the Mike 1 crew detected the smell of a fresh predation in the air and noted a slick ahead of the whales. They presumed that other whales may be present, and via VHF radio asked the now departed whale-watch vessel and the shore-based Race Rocks eco-guardian to keep a lookout. Sure enough, within 15 minutes, both parties would momentarily observe at least two additional killer whales just south of the lighthouse, but neither were able to keep track of the animals.
Meanwhile, the T077s and T075s came together approximately two nautical miles south of Race Rocks and slowed to allow an outbound car-carrier passage west. The animals turned east-northeast in the ship’s wake, and Mike 1 ventured north after spotting the elusive ‘new’ animals just a mile north. They shortly found the T099s travelling east-southeast on an intercepting course for the larger group offshore of them. Both groups spent around five minutes at the surface as they arced east before diving for nearly the same. When they resurfaced the five T099s had joined the T077s and T075s cohort and all were porpoising east. The matriarchs led the charge and the sprouting males T077C and T099C brought up the rear, while the numerous juveniles filled in the space between. The pod surged on for several minutes before the team ended the encounter at 1619 and turned to Victoria as a strong westerly storm set in on the Strait. The killer whales were last seen still travelling quickly east-northeast toward the south end of Haro Strait.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-82

The animals were milling at the site of a presumed predation, before turning west as Mike 1 passed Albert Head and the commercial whale-watch vessel departed the scene.
They managed to reacquire a single male killer whale ~ 2 nm offshore of East Sooke Park at 1440, moving steadily west-southwest and quickly confirmed him as T251, an outer-coastal Bigg’s killer whale known well in recent years from autumn and winter visits to the region. He is typically accompanied by his presumed mother and sister, T252 and the T253s. As the initial report indicated four whales present, they were scanning carefully for the remainder, though building seas and dark light to the west made spotting challenging and they saw no sign of others.
T251 seemed to be pushing offshore, but with his zig-zagging travel pattern, they decided that if the other three animals had held a steadier line from their predation, they would be ahead of the bull. The Mike 1 team eased west as the bull dove and soon came across a slick and faint odour of pinniped oil which suggested they were on the right track! Sure enough, just a few hundred metres upwind of the slick, they spotted two smaller fins slicing through the surf. As they approached the animals dove and another appeared just inshore before also disappearing.
Shortly after an adult female and juvenile resurfaced steaming west at nearly 8 knots. The two animals were familiar, but not who the team expected. Instead, they were two lesser-known outer-coastal Bigg’s, T241 and T241B. These two have been encountered in the Salish Sea before but not nearly as often as the T252s and generally in the company of animals from the outer-coastal population. The female that had been inshore caught up and was confirmed to be T252.
With fading light and rapidly building westerly seas, Mark and Joe collected left-side identification photos of all three westbound individuals, turned east and ended the encounter at 1542 ~ 2.5 nm southwest of Otter Point. They departed the area slowly as they scanned for any sign of the remaining T252s but saw none and continued east to calmer seas.
Note: Photos passed along to the team from the commercial whale-watch crew confirmed that the four animals identified in this encounter (Encounter 81) were the same that were prey-sharing together off Church Rock earlier in the day. The remainder of the T252s (T253 and T253A) were not observed visually at any point this day, but with the adverse sea conditions, it is possible that they were within acoustic range of the others. Apart from a single T251-only encounter, the T252s and T253s have only been encountered together.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-81

They completed some humpback whale photo-identification near Race Rocks and headed that way.
As they reached Ogden Point, the bull was reportedly on a rare foray into Victoria’s Middle Harbour! They proceeded slowly toward Shoal Point, and soon spotted the large animal now outbound along the Shoal Point shore. T049A1 held a tight shoreline route past the Canadian Coast Guard Base and chased a seal down at the James Bay Anglers’ boat ramp in what must have been just 10 feet of water. He quickly carried on, but the distinct sweet smell of pinniped oil filled the air indicating a successful predation. The bull snaked his way out of the harbour along the Ogden Point cruise ship piers and breakwater before giving onlookers a wonderful close pass right at the light marking the harbour entrance.
As T049A1 continued his shoreline foraging just outside the kelp beds along the Victoria shoreline, the Mike 1 crew ended the encounter and turned for home.
Note: As Mark and Joe transited the Harbour to Mike 1’s berth, they came across another sweet-smelling slick, indicating successful predation near Pelly Island. Harbour Patrol confirmed their suspicion that T049A1 had departed the harbour after at least two successful predations, relaying that the animal had been hunting in that area for at least ten minutes prior to Mike 1 arriving on scene.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-80

Sparse humpback sightings had filled their time between choppy water transits, and they planned just one more stop en route to Victoria, at the southwest edge of Constance Bank.
At 1420 as they turned offshore from Pedder Bay, a large male killer whale appeared ahead! He dove, and the guys concluded they had spotted the breath preceding a dive sequence. After nearly eight minutes the killer whale reappeared, on a generally northerly track, arcing only slightly toward Constance Bank. The solitary animal was identified as T049C, a frequent visitor to the region, who has been observed patrolling the waters of the south Salish Sea each of the past three autumns, and has already been present this year since mid-October. He is also seen in the area throughout the spring.
The bull continued steadily north-northeast for the next three breath sequences, averaging 4.5 minute down times, and deviated just once in possible pursuit of prey.

Since it was a nice day and the whole SR community had been up in the Strait of Georgia for the past week, Dave headed to the boat and left Snug Harbor at 1315. “Orcinus” arrived on scene at 1405 about two miles north of Tumbo Island. The whales were spread out and heading southeast toward East Point. The first whale seen was J40 with J27 about 150 yards to the west of her. Maybe a quarter mile due north of these whales was a small active group that included J49, J53, and J59. The J22s were a couple of hundred yards to the northwest of them and J37 was also in the area. Another group several hundred yards to the east of these whales was the J16s. The J31s were about a hundred yards to the east of the J16s and J39 was a little east of the J31s. All the whales were heading towards East Point. The J11s, J14s, J16s, and J22s came together in a loose line up as they approached Boiling Reef and East Point. Another group of whales had been nearer to the Saturna Island shoreline and had headed east through Tumbo Channel before reaching East Point ahead of the rest of J pod. By about 1445, J pod was entering the Saturna Island no-boat zone so there was about a forty minute gap in observations while we waited for the whales to get closer to Monarch Head. It was apparent, by this point, that J pod had detached itself from K and L pods and had left them somewhere back up north in the Strait of Georgia.
The lead group of J pod approached Monarch Head by about 1520. This group was active and splashing and there were several breaches. A lone female was foraging by herself ahead of the group and this turned out to be J19. She eventually moved back to the group which was the rest of the J19s and the J35s. Near Monarch Head, the group began milling and there were several spyhops. It appeared that the whales had been playing with kelp. The J19s and J35s were nearing the Java Islets when they turned southeasterly toward Waldron Island. The rest of J pod had moved to the American side of Boundary Pass and were heading south a little northwest of Skipjack Island. The encounter ended at 1545 near the Java Islets with the J19s and J35s moving slowly back across Boundary Pass toward the rest of J pod.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-78

They departed on Mike 1 at 1318 and headed east towards Trial Island, where Gord, tracking them from the ""Crow's Nest,"" had spotted them last. They arrived on the scene with the lead group slightly east of Staines Point at 1332. The whales were tight together and heading east, while more fins could be seen behind and to the southwest. The first whale identified was J27, who was traveling closely with J31, J56, and J53. Moments later, the J14s, J17s, and J22s surfaced in tandem after a long dive, while the J16s surfaced parallel but further to the north.
After identifying all members of J pod, they turned their sights towards the southern whales but were surprised to see that the western whales had picked up the pace and were closing in fast. At 1341 Mark positioned the boat to allow the whales to pass on the port side as they seemed to be edging into the Js. The first whales to pass by Mike 1 after repositioning were K12 and her son, K37. Brendon then spotted K20, K38, and K45, and the team took a few right sides before collecting photos of the remaining K12s, K13s, K14s, and K16s, who were also tightly knit. 
At this stage, it was becoming clear that there were members of all three pods present, with all of J pod and K pod confirmed to the north, while a large group still lagged behind a mile to the southwest. Mark and Brendon left the grouped-up Js and Ks approaching Seabird Point at 1354 and then doubled back to survey the remaining members of the Clan. It was noted that the K12s were 300 metres from the collective group. 
Mike 1 caught up with the large group of Ls at 1359. The team was optimistically suspicious that the entirety of L pod might be present due to the sheer number of fins and blows. Brendon identified the first whales as the L12s with L87 and the L54s. Soon after, the L55s, L72s, L90, and L91 also joined the mix, while the remainder of the L47s were found in smaller groups throughout. 
As L pod approached Seabird Point, the whales began to fan out. A flock of gulls appeared on the scene shortly after as the team witnessed a brief foraging event. To the southeast, Js and Ks were stalled out but on a line for Middle Bank. Satisfied that they had cleaned them up and with the sun fading, the team decided to end the encounter at 1520 and head back to Victoria as the L12s and L54s continued east over Beaumont Shoals.

EncSummary:After communicating with Mark as he was with J, K, and L pods coming in past the Victoria waterfront, Dave and Federica met at Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1500. We were hoping to get a look at L88 and the L54s before the light failed and Mark was waiting for us with L pod near Middle Bank. We were passing CWR when we saw a small group of whales heading north. The whales went on a lengthy long dive and disappeared so, thinking this group was either some Js or possibly transients, we moved on to where Mark was waiting for us. We later found out that these whales were the T2Cs. 
We got on scene near Middle Bank at 1535 with L pod heading slowly northeast. L pod had split into groups with most of the L12s in a line-up furthest to the east. L54, L88, and L108 were following the L12s by about 100 yards . Maybe about a quarter mile to the northwest of the L12s and L54s, was the rest of L pod. The bulk of the L4s, L47s, and L72s, plus L87 and L90 were in a single group with 2-3 slightly peripheral groups of socializing sub-adult males involving L106, L109, L110, L115, L117, L121, L122, and L123. The main group of L pod zig-zagged a bit and there was some milling but all of L pod were generally slowly heading southeast by the time the encounter was over. J and K pods were further south and spread out in the Hein Bank area. We ended the encounter with L pod at 1630 in order to get home before dark.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-77

They came across several lunge-feeding humpbacks working the herring balls forming in Race Pass and continued a westward track after a quick stop to get a sense of the spread.
Mike 1 ran west 3 nm off the Vancouver Island shoreline and while stopped off Sooke to wait for a diving humpback to reappear that was ahead of them. Mark received a call at 1058 from his friend and colleague Joe Zelwietro that a group of 4 or 5 killer whales had appeared south of Race Rocks heading east with a newish calf. Frustrated that he had missed them on his way west but with hopes that it was the T046B1's, seen by some of the commercial whale watchers the previous Sunday with a new calf, Mark decided to double back to take a look. 
He arrived with what turned out to be the T049A's at 1135 ~3 nm southeast of Race Rocks. T049A's eldest son, T049A1, nor her second eldest son, T049A2, were present as they are often dispersed from the family. 
The group of five animals, with the newest addition, T049A6, born in early 2022, were tight together, traveling southeast before they took a turn to the northeast and followed a tide line toward Constance Bank. 
At 1220 they stalled out just south of the southwest corner of the bank and appeared to have gotten a seal and prey shared before they continued on. 
Mark ended the encounter at 1247 and returned to Victoria harbour as they crossed Constance Bank and continued their northeast track.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-76

The conditions were ideal, with no wind and partial clouds with sunny skies. 
Many humpbacks started to be seen as soon as Mike 1 approached Race Pass, so he slowed down and picked a safe path westward less than a mile from the Vancouver Island shoreline. Mark could see that most of the humpbacks were surface feeding with very little fluking, so he continued on with the intent to stop and collect opportunistic humpback flukes on his search for killer whales.
The humpbacks' sightings continued as far as Otter Point, and Mark estimated that there were over 50 animals between Race Rocks and here.
Once he reached Sheringham lighthouse, he looped out towards the middle of the Juan de Fuca Strait and turned back to the east. 
At 1055 he spotted killer whales south of Otter Point on his port side less than a mile to the north of him! As he got his camera out, he could see four animals in a tight group pointed southeast in the moderate ground swell. His immediate thought was it looked like the T252's which are often around in the fall. He got a couple of pictures of them before they finished their dive sequence and then kept a sharp lookout to resight them before they vanished, as they can be a very wiley group with long dives and erratic direction of travel.
He resighted them within a couple of minutes to the northwest of him but they were now traveling quickly westward. 
Once he was able to get abeam of them on the following dive cycle, he realized that they were the T123s, also a family of four with a bull, so understandably an honest mistake in their identity.
The T123s held their westward track for the next hour doing between 8 and 9 knots with T123A in the lead a quarter mile to the northwest of his mom and younger sisters. Mike 1 ended the encounter at 1154 south of Sheringham Point and returned to Victoria harbour. 
Note: On October 15, Dave had come across this group two days prior in limited visibility eastbound south of Trial Island on his way home to San Juan Island after visiting Ken at the Big Salmon Ranch at the Elwha River (see Encounter 74). 
On October 1, Mark saw them chasing the T252s westward for a few minutes before turning east off of Sheringham Point (see Encounter 69).
Mark later heard that the T252s were picked up near the Papa Alpha buoy (~ 5 nm northwest of Port Angeles/~ 5 nm south of Race Rocks) eastbound by one of the whale watch boats. 
When he downloaded his photos that evening, he discovered that the first whales he got distant shots of were, in fact, the T252s! The T123s and the T252s had indeed crossed paths once again.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-75

There was a steady misty rain falling and poor visibility. The spit could not be seen in the gloom but, after steering by Garmin, “Orcinus” finally made it around the buoy at the end of the spit and pointed north towards home. Visibility was still, at best, a couple of hundred feet with a heavy mist. There were frequent stops to wipe the rain off the glasses and to check the Garmin. After about fifteen minutes of wet boat ride, it opened up a bit and quit raining. There was now maybe a mile or more of visibility depending on what direction one was looking although there were no land masses visible. At about 1155, Dave was cruising along when he saw a male killer whale dorsal fin at about one o’clock off the boat’s bow. The male turned out to be T123A and the rest of the T123s and they were a couple miles south of the US/Canadian border somewhere south of the Trial Island area. The T123s were heading slowly northeast in less than a tight group with just a little bit of milling. T123D glided over to the boat while upside down and passed under it. The whales were acting quite relaxed and were not arching much at all with long dives of just a couple of minutes. After about ten minutes, the whales went on another long dive and disappeared.

With the sun getting low in the sky and the whales headed further from home, the team decided to make the encounter quick. The whales were split into two groups. In the front was T35A with T35A2 and new calf T35A4, with T35A1 hanging a bit off from the other four. Behind was T38A with her kid T38A2 and T35A3.

The conditions were idyllic with not a breath of wind and Beaufort 0 conditions. 
They came across a couple of humpbacks as they worked their way up the Canadian side of the strait, a single juvenile near Church Rocks feeding in the tide line and a west bound adult ~ 1 nm off East Sooke Park.
After getting photos of a humpback cow and calf pair heading west at 9 knots off of Point no Point, 
Mark had a 5 minute binocular scan to the south and west before he heard what sounded like multiple humpback blows well to the south west. As he started to make his way in that direction he saw a back of a humpback and eventually multiple blows in the direction of Clallam Bay.
Between 1040 and 1200 he collected as many of the ~ 80 individuals fluke identification shots as he could before continuing north west back towards the Canadian side of the Strait. After another binocular scan slightly west of Sombrio Point he decided to make his way back to the east. 
At ~ 1215 Mark heard over the VHF radio that his colleague Paul from Sooke Explorations had come across the T069's east bound a little south of Sheringham Point. As Mike 1 neared their location the radio chatter indicated that all the boats had to leave due to time restraints so Mark offered to stop in for a quick encounter and hold onto the T069 group until the next commercial boat arrived.
At 1240 he had his first look at them tightly grouped up doing fairly long dives of 5 - 6 minutes. They appeared to be almost in a partial resting pattern but were making 5 knots in a SE direction. Mark had almost lost them after the first sequence but at around the 5 minute mark of their dive sequence as he was standing up on the front of the console to get a slight height of eye advantage over the minor ground swell, he spotted T069C's large dorsal fin behind him to the west. They appeared like they had stalled on a potential prey but as he trolled over towards them could see that they were still on their south east track.
After 7 or 8 minutes from the end of their second dive sequence Mark knew that he had missed an entire sequence and then another 10 minutes passed and he was quite humbled that they had given him the slip.
One of the large commercial whale watch boats called Mike 1 on the VHF knowing that he was holding onto them but Mark had to tell him that he hadn't seen them in close to 20 minutes. There were now 2 of the large commercial boats in the area looking so after another final scan Mark decided to head for home on a line for the shoreline of East Sooke. He had found the T069's there the day before around the same time east bound and it seemed unlikely that they had turned back west. Mark also felt that the he would have seen the blows to the south with the backlighting.
At 1342, ~ 40 minutes after last seeing them, they appeared off Mike 1's starboard bow 1 nm south west of Secretary Island, moving quickly north east towards the shoreline of East Sooke Park!

At 8:55, the team got off the dock and made their way down the west side, and soon found whales just south of Lime Kiln at 9:11. With great lighting and glass calm water, the team got the drone in the air to begin aerial observations of the whales' behavior.

The whales were spread and foraging, with members of the J19s, J22s, J17s, and J37s spread throughout the area. The team saw lots of prey searching and dives to foraging depth, but didn't see this group bringing many fish to the surface initially, except for one observation of J51 with a fish in his mouth playing keep-away from his sister J58.

The team moved down island and inshore to another small group of whales, composed of J42, J53, and J46. They watched as this group charged into a large school of fish, but they didn't appear to catch any. However, a few minutes later, J42 seemed to find a fish deeper in the water column, which she and J53 chased together to the surface, where J42 eventually made a the capture and shared half the fish with J53. Soon after, the team also found J31 and J56, already sharing a fish.

The next group the team found was the J35s and J40. After an unsuccessful prey chase, J40 split from the J35s. The J35s then successfully chased a fish to the surface, where J35 lunged to capture the fish and shared it with her two sons.

The team found males J45 and J44 nearby, searching for fish and chasing a few schools, but not seeming to have much luck. Down by False Bay, the team found a big group of females socializing. This was J31, J36, J40, J42, J56, and J58. The team stayed with this group for some time, until technical issues with the battery forced them to end the encounter and head back to the dock.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-uav18

The team left Snug at 10:10, and after fueling up the boat met the whales as they headed south past Battleship at 10:57. The water was glass calm and the lighting was perfect for aerial observations. Whales were spread out and foraging.

The first whale the team flew over was J42, who almost immediately chased a fish to the surface and caught it. After observing her process this fish, the team moved over to J31 and J56, and then J26, all of whom were headed south slowly while searching for fish. J31 and J56 soon joined up with J36 and J22, who was processing a salmon when they met up.

The teamed moved off this group and found J38, who was in the middle of some hunting. Our study hadn't been able to get much footage of adult males foraging, so we were very excited when we saw J38 chasing a fish in the gloom, which he eventually chased to the surface and caught. This footage (and the footage we later got of J39) will be extremely useful in analyzing how size of the whales and salmon interact to determine foraging efficiency.

The team next found J35, also chasing and successfully catching a fish. After finding a fish, she met up with her two sons, J47 and J57, who had been travelling south nearby. Inshore of this group, J40, J49, and calf J59 socialized as travelled.

The next set of whales the team flew over was an interesting mix of females, including J41 and her calf J58, J53, J42, and J40. J40 initially accompanied J58, but handed the calf off when they met up with J41. Once this group came together, they picked up a lot of speed and porpoised south.


Inshore of these whales, subadult male J39 was foraging on his own. The team got great footage of him maneuvering to catch the fish, and then processing the fish by biting it into two halves that he swallowed separately.

Offshore of J39, J40 was also finding and chasing fish. After she found one fish near the surface, J53 came rushing over to investigate. As J53 kept the fish moving and at the surface, J40 disappeared to the north. A couple minutes later, she re-appeared, lunging at great speed to catch the fish while J53 distracted it. J40 then broke the fish in half, sharing the catch with J53.

The team kept up with the whales as they rounded Kellet Bluff. J39, J40, and J53 all continued to chase fish near the bluffs, catching a couple but also losing some as they escaped into the shallows inside of the kelp beds. Offshore, J46 accompanied the J37s as they travelled north. J39 stuck back near the bluffs, while J40 and J53 continued north together, catching and sharing a couple more fish.

On their way, the crew spotted another group of killer whales that had not been previously reported that day, making their way up the west side. The team had used all their drone batteries on the T100s, so set out to get proof of presence and ID photos on the whales in the group.

The whales were split into two groups, with two males and two juveniles in the back, and two adult females leading the way. The team quickly IDed the two adult males as T101A and T101B, and later IDed one of the juveniles as T100B1. Strangely enough, it turned out that the last juvenile was T65A5, who seems to be a free agent these days in terms of social affiliation.

The adult males and youngsters were extremely frisky and playful, with lots of rolling and splashing at the surface and some visible ""sea snakes."" These four eventually split, with T101B and T100B1 staying further offshore while T101A and T65A5 cut very close inshore. T101 and T100B led the group some ways in front of the others.

Sure enough, at 1154, the team received word that T251 had been located nearby so Mark and Brendon quickly made their way down to Mike 1 and departed the harbour at 1230. 
The encounter began at 1257 with the T252s meandering west at 6 knots. Initially, the group was in a tight resting formation but the bull, T251, seemed restless and would periodically break rank and charge ahead. Mark and Brendon counted 9-12 surfacings per sequence followed by varied dive times (which decreased throughout the encounter): 7m26s, 6m14s, 5m14s, 4m29s…At 1415 they slowed briefly ~3.5 nm south of the entrance to Sooke harbour (48 17.17/123 44.65) and appeared to have grabbed a seal before continuing west.
As the whales were ~ 3nm south southwest of Otter Point their pace quickened to 8 knots with occasional porpoising. The team considered whether the change in pace was in response to prey or nearby whales and decided to push further west at 1447.

At 1508, less than 2 miles to the southwest of where they had left the T252's, Mark spotted a lone bull on the horizon point south. Before arriving on scene with the bull, they spotted what looked to be a few whales to the south and pushed out into the building seas to view them first. These turned out to be a pair of younger whales, which Brendon quickly identified as T046B1A and T046C2 “Sam"". The two females were surfacing erratically and spontaneously as the team attempted to secure right-side IDs. After taking a few shots, the team overheard a call on the radio from nearby whale watching vessels reporting that another group had come charging in to join the T252s. With T046B1 nowhere in sight, Mark and Brendon decided to let the two whales continue on and doubled-back towards the T252s to see which group had joined them.

When Mike 1 caught up with the T252s and their new travel companions at 1527, they were pushing west at a good clip ~3nm south of Sheringham Pt (48 18.6/123 55.4). Brendon identified the new additions as the T123s – a commonly encountered family of four who were last seen heading west in the Strait of Juan de Fuca on September 8th. The eight whales were porpoising west quickly with the T252s in the lead. The team took a few left-side shots before departing a few minutes later to see if they could find the bull that they had previously seen although they suspected that it was likely T123A who had later joined up with his family before they met up with the T252's. On their search back east, the team reacquired T046B1A and T046C2 east bound at 1609 ~6 nm south southeast of Otter Point (48 18.6/123 55.4) but with no sign of T046B1, with now much nicer sea conditions, it seemed apparent that she was not present. Mark and Brendon ended the encounter at 1609 and made way for Victoria.

They got off the dock at 11:30 and headed up Mosquito Pass and through Spieden Channel to find the whales. They arrived on scene at 12:05, with the T100s heading towards the north side of Spieden Island.

The whales travelled in a typical tight group, cutting past Green Point without taking a swipe at three Steller sea lions sitting in the kelp, and then headed into the east side of Spieden Channel. They tucked into a cove on the San Juan shoreline and made the first of many harbor seal kills we would observe during the encounter, and then proceeded to process and share the kill as they headed south down the San Juan shoreline.

The whales made another kill before reaching the mouth of Friday Harbor, although they mostly caught the seals at depth, so the drone could only observe the prey sharing afterwards. The whales continued into Griffin Bay. We heard reports that there was a minke whale very nearby, however the minke ended up avoided the T100s. The killer whales continued to sleepily make their way across Griffin Bay.

As the whales neared the south side of the bay, they woke up again and began hunting. From the drone, we observed T100E kill a harbor seal with her flukes. T100C then grabbed the seal and immediately passed it over to his mom, T100. The whole matriline then spent some quality time sharing their kill.

The whales made two more seal kills in Griffin Bay before continuing towards Cattle Point., where they made one last kill that we observed. The whales continued heading offshore, and then cut northwest.

They left the dock at 11:13 and headed down island.

By 11:32, the team had found whales off Hannah Heights and launched the drone a few minutes later. Initially, they found a group composed of the J19s, J37 and J59, along with J22. These whales were engaged in some high energy socializing before splitting up. The team stayed with the J19s as they continued to slowly move down island.

After a couple flights with the J19s, the team moved towards False Bay to see what other groups were around to survey. They found J35 and J57 headed down island. The pair broke offshore, and soon met up with J35's teenage son, J47. These three stayed in tight formation as they arced back towards shore.

The team then moved on the their next group of whales, which turned out to be the entire J14 matriline, including new calf J59. These whales also moved in a tight, social group. They seemed to be following the J19s, who were a few hundred yards ahead of them, back towards San Juan Island. Once the whales were closer to shore in front of False Bay, they stalled out and milled as the J35s came up island to meet them.

The team left this subgroup and headed towards Eagle Point, where they found a very social group of adult females from a few different matrilines: J31, J36, J42, and J46. These whales were mainly interested in socializing, but at one point did pause to briefly chase a fish, although they didn't appear to catch it. Some ways away, J53 and J56 worked together to chase their own fish, which J53 eventually caught and appeared to share with J56.

They then came across J16 slightly ahead foraging. She, along with the rest of the animals that Mark and Rod could see also appeared to be foraging. J38 was actively pursuing a salmon near Bechey Head and after a big lunge it was apparent that he had hit a salmon so Mark had Rod taxi the boat over to the foot print while he stood on the bow box with the dip net.

They took advantage of the near perfect weather and set off to the west towards Swiftsure Bank after a good scan and hydrophone drop south of the mouth of Port of San Juan. They could see humpbacks galore to the south and east but no sign of any killer whales so they stuck to their westward planned trek. After another hydrophone drop and scan and getting some opportunistic humpback identification fluke pictures north east of the Bank they worked their way south west to where the Northern Residents were foraging the day before. Mark hoped that some of the Southern Residents would be taking a turn at that area today. With no sign of life at “yesterday’s hot killer whale spots”, Mark decided to take a run south east towards Cape Flattery. As they approached Tatoosh Island they got into moderate north easterly winds making spotting a bit difficult with the spray hitting the windshield but they continued to slog their way towards the Cape. The seas flattened out as they got into the lee and the trio trolled the cliffs and majestic rock formations while they had a quick lunch.
After lunch Mark decided to take a tack back to the north west towards Swiftsure Bank to maximize their search efforts. At 1340, as they were passing Tatoosh Island, Rod spotted what he thought could have been a killer whale. A humpback whale blew in the direction of where he pointed out his sighting and then Mark finally saw several swells away what Rod had previously seen and said “That looked very killerwhale-esque” and a couple of seconds later they saw an obvious breaching killer whale emerge at the top of the swell!
As the whales approached them, Mark was able to confirm immediately they were Residents and soon confirmed members of J pod. J42's distinct saddle could be seen as she and her sister, J36, went ripping past Mike 1 as they surfed down the large ocean swell. They were averaging 8 knots for several minutes as they travelled east until they got inside the entrance to the Juan de Fuca and the swells had settled. They then slowed down, spread out even more and started foraging. The Mike 1 crew spent the next hour scanning around in an effort to find other members of the Clan but concluded that it was only members of J pod present.

They worked in tandem with their colleagues from the Canadian DFO, and after several hydrophone drops and visual scans, were able to zero in on a large group of killer whales by 1136. There had been reports of Northern Resident killer whales in the vicinity throughout the season, including during the CWR’s western survey this week, and just after the CWR team set their eyes on the animals, they received word from the DFO team that they had just detected killer whale calls acoustically from just a few miles behind Mike 1! As Mike 1 slowly approached the large group of foraging killer whales Mark was fairly confident that these were Northern Residents.
Their assumption (later confirmed) was that the whales belonged to G clan, one of three clans that comprise the Northern Resident community; all Southern Residents belong to J clan. In contrast to their southern counterparts, Northern Residents have a somewhat fluid social structure, often leaving researchers to tally the individuals by matrilines present, not simply by clan or pod. They are also far more numerous; G clan alone contains approximately 100 animals. The CWR team were able to confirm members of five matrilines: the G2s, G3s, G27s, I33s, I35s and I68s. Not all members of each were photographed, and it is possible that only some individuals were there Saturday or that the whales were simply too dispersed throughout the area to census fully.
The animals were spread and foraging for the duration of the encounter, and quite successfully if the constant bird life diving for scraps in wakes was any indication. Contrary to Southern Resident encounters throughout the week, much of the G clan foraging seemed to be high in the water column, with short three or four minute absences from any given whale, rather than the eight to ten minute cycle that Mark and Joe had been experiencing with J clan whales throughout the week. Individuals were also closer together, and groups of three or four were not hard to find. After documenting many of the individuals present, the crew ended the encounter at 1403 and made way northeast, in an effort to locate some of the Southern Resident community!",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-64

After a search in windy and wet conditions, the team headed back into Port Renfrew for fuel, food, and warmth. After changing into some dry clothes, Mark, Gary, and Tasli headed out again but, this time, they decided to head east in Juan de Fuca Strait, based on reports of that had come in earlier in the day of possible Southern Residents near Sheringham Lighthouse. The weather and sea conditions were much improved from the morning, and as the team made their way east, numerous humpback whales were sighted. As they stopped to photograph an aggregation of ~50 Humpback whales off Magdalena Point, Tasli spotted several fins offshore. They mobilized quickly and soon came across J Pod heading west, spread out, and foraging. 
The first whales they saw were J37 and J59, who were foraging, with J49 nearby. J56 was seen in tight group with J35 and her calf J57. J53 and J42 were foraging together, chasing a fish in tight circles. The team also observed J26 actively foraging on his own, with several gulls following him looking for scraps.

The team’s rough estimate is that there are currently 175-200 unique individuals in the Juan de Fuca, perhaps the densest aggregation documented in the area since the population has begun to recover post-commercial whaling.
Mark and Joe presumed Southern Residents were not far from where they had left them the prior evening, and after refuelling at lunch, pushed that way. Shortly after leaving the dock, their colleagues at the DFO confirmed that indeed, Southern Resident killer whales were present (and westbound) off Cullite Cove, Vancouver Island. They continued west, and at 1528 were finally able to see the distant blows of J Clan just north of Everest (~6nm se of Swiftsure Bank).
The first group encountered were J19 and some of the J14s, travelling in a tight grouping to the south-southwest. J37 and young J59 were present, alongside J40. K34 and K43 were the next animals sighted, but it was clear that many Js and Ks were present, J19, J51, K26, K35, J39 and J44 among them. The team were also privy to a visit from K20 and K45, both looking healthy and energetic. The clan were generally trending toward the southwest, but were foraging as they went, and though it was tough to confirm with animals spread two or three miles in every direction, they seemed to be spending more time travelling and less time fishing than the previous evening. The spread was also smaller than the previous evening, with several pairs and small groups present. Still, some successful foraging was observed, and after a few minutes with K20 and K45, Fin was growing restless and ready to move on to humpback whales, so Mark and Joe ended the encounter at 1719 and picked their way through a few large groups of the leviathans before returning to Port Renfrew for the evening.
NotesComments:After ending the encounter, the Mike 1 crew passed and documented L72, L105 and others spread to the north-northeast of Everest.

By the time they wrapped up the encounter though, the information was a little stale, and conditions were not ideal to be searching. Luckily, before they had a chance to pull the plug, Mark spotted a few distinct killer whale blows just offshore, and enough of them to suggest Residents!
Sure enough, the first animals spotted were L pod killer whales, L87 and L88. The two males were foraging, and every animal spotted was well spread from any other, with an average of 0.25 nm between individuals. This of course made ID efforts difficult, but it was nice to see so much foraging, and much of it apparently successful. K14 and K42 were foraging close to each other and the L pod males, but eventually came together to travel east. J47 was the next individual documented, suggesting that all members of the clan may be present…none of the L12s had yet been confirmed, but Mark later captured a photo of L94.
The animals were spread and foraging, though the general trend was east, and Mark and Joe were able to confirm several more individuals from all three pods, before L85, the J16s, J22s, J19 and a few others came together and the entire clan began pushing back to the west-southwest.

He was able to document T060C and T002B travelling together, and while he did not find the remainder of the T060s, knew they were likely near after coming across a large slick indicative of recent predation just ahead of the two killer whales. He continued to Port Renfrew to meet Joe, and they topped up the fuel before heading back out into the western Strait of Juan de Fuca.
Departing Port San Juan, the trio (Fin included) set out offshore and steered straight to a few spouts, which were found to be the remaining three members of the T060s! T060 and her two youngest, T060F and T060G were westbound in a tight group, though T060F occasionally moved off from the other two for a breath sequence or two before rejoining. They made quick work of (likely) a harbour seal south of Cullite Cove, before continuing on their westerly track. 
Having documented the expected remainder of the T060 matriline (males T060D and T060E have dispersed from the group for the time being) Mark and Joe decided to idle east for a bit to see if they could determine how far astern the original pair may be, and soon spotted them just under two miles behind the three.

They caught up to a small spread of female and juvenile killer whales just north of William Head, still working their way south. They began the encounter at 0832 with the easily identifiable T037, and her daughter T037B. The animals were travelling very slowly, with six- to eight-minute dives. After collecting left-side ID photos of the duo, the Mike 1 crew manoeuvred inshore to find T034 and her youngest, T034B.
Still missing two animals from the group, T034A and T037B1, Mark and Joe lingered on the periphery of the found group and scanned southwest, toward shore and a few active bait balls. It took several minutes before Mark was finally able to detect the missing pair, with a third, well inside the entrance to Pedder Bay.
All seven animals came together at the south shore of Pedder Bay, and charged into the kelp beds spread across the entrance to Eemdyk Pass. No predation was observed during their frolic through the kelp, but the seventh whale was identified as young T065A5, a roamer who has been seen throughout the region this summer, currently dispersed from his mother and siblings. They were also able to get a great look at young T034B’s flank, which carries a much more vibrant dorsal cape than any other Bigg’s seen in the region.
Mark and Joe ended the encounter at 0928 and turned home to Victoria. The group were later observed by commercial whale-watch vessels travelling west in the Juan de Fuca Strait, shadowing outbound Southern Residents by just a few miles, just as they were when they most recently entered the Salish Sea from the west on September 11th.

However, as the whales moved up Rosario Strait, they grouped up with T60, T60F, and T60G, who had apparently been further east in the strait.

While grouped up, T60C did a lot of tactile social behavior with the other matriline members, while T2B seemed to stay slightly to the periphery.

Within minutes, the whales surfaced again and Brendon instantly recognized them as T060D & T060E, who were not present in the large group to the south. These two brothers, aged 14 and 18 respectively, have only loosely associated with the other members of their family since the summer of 2019. 
The brothers were moving west at 7 knots, but slowed occasionally to inspect the many murres & auklets floating at the surface.

Immediately, it was clear that the whales were not going anywhere fast; with loose groups spread out every which direction, some of whom were socializing while others slowly moved to the west. Mark positioned the boat parallel to the most westerly group of whales, which were soon identified as T060, T060F & T060G. More whales were spread out behind them, so after a quick look at these three individuals, Mark and Brendon opted to start working through the remaining extensive group, which they could see socializing a few hundred meters behind. 
This group was angled west-northwest and after determining that lighting was most optimal for lefts, the team moved over to the port side of the whales. Quickly, Brendon was able to identify the group as the T069s, T109As and three members of the T059s: T059, T059A2 & T059A4. These three have been associating with members of the T060s and T109Bs in recent weeks, so it was interesting to see them traveling rather tightly with the T109As.
After photographing lefts, and a few rights, over the course of the next half hour, it was determined that the only missing whales were dispersed brothers, T060D & T060E (who would show up in the following sequence), and close companions T002B & T060C who may simply have been further ahead.

Through Race Pass by 0720, they opted to travel offshore and west along the south edge of the traffic separation scheme, as they assumed word would come from the sport fishing fleet of any activity along the Vancouver Island coast.

Sure enough, after working back up to just south of Sombrio Point and documenting a small aggregation of humpback whales, reports came in of two large pods of eastbound killer whales at Sheringham Point. They departed the humpbacks and travelled east to reach Point No Point by 1101. A large lineup of killer whales had been visible for several miles, and the crew were guessing Southern Residents. Sure enough, L87 was the first animal identified, along with several other L pod whales. This group turned out to contain all of the L12s and their constant companions L22, L25 and L85, and the larger subgroup of L pod that L87 has been travelling with for the last few years, the L4s, L47s, L72 and L105, and L90. They were travelling in a tight group with good pace toward Sheringham Point. The L54s were not seen, for a total of 28 L pod killer whales.

As the earlier reports had placed two pods already a few miles east of these Ls, Mark and co. continued east on the assumption that at least one of the other two Southern Resident pods were leading the way in.

They reached Sheringham Point by 1126 and spotted another large eastbound group just ahead, which appeared to include the very distinct K33. K33 was travelling with the rest of K pod, including a young K45 and mother K20! A third, more restful group soon appeared just inshore of and behind K33's cohort.

The inshore group proved to be all of J pod, making their way slowly through the Saturday sport fishing fleet toward Otter Point. With every present member of the clan soon documented, the Mike 1 crew ended the encounter at 1158 and went ashore for lunch at Otter Point. They were able to observe all three pods pass the Point, watching as L pod spread well out after both Js and Ks passed within 200 metres.

After a hearty lunch, Mark, Joe, Tasli and the pup hopped back on Mike 1 and decided to see if any foraging could be observed on their way back to Victoria. L pod was still spread offshore, and the K pod whales were apparently well east, but J pod was milling playfully just off Sooke Harbour so the team were treated to several minutes of spyhopping and surface vocals. The J22s eventually broke off from the group for more private socializing, as did young males J44 and J47.

The Mike 1 crew spent the next little while working their way home through whales spread from Secretary Island to Race Rocks and from the Vancouver Island shore to the south edge of the traffic lanes in singles and small groups. The J clan whales were all travelling east-southeast, but grouped up somewhat and angled for San Juan Island's west side by late afternoon.
NotesComments:11-year-old male K44 was not observed this day, and has not been encountered by CWR staff since late November of last year. His absence was first noted July 9th, when CWR first observed K45 on K pod's return to the Salish Sea, and it seems unlikely that he is alive, as every other member of the clan has been observed since that time.

K20 was notably healthier than when documented by CWR in early July, a good sign for her and young K45.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-49

They began the encounter at 1722 south of Sombrio Point, Vancouver Island with three killer whales. It took a few surfaces to place the whales, but the crew soon identified the animals as some rare visitors to the Salish Sea: T132, T134 and T237. The trio are more well-known from the outer coast, having been encountered from California to Glacier Bay, Alaska, but are rarely seen anywhere and are poorly known. They were relatively mellow for a few minutes before making an obvious turn south and picking up the pace at 1800.
Guessing the Bigg’s may have detected the presence of another group of killer whales, the Mike 1 crew took a moment to scan south before following. They spotted two additional groups of 5-6 animals, one of which was apparently hunting. As the T134s and T237 were well committed to a rendezvous with the others, the Mike 1 crew moved on to the southern whales. The distinct smell of fresh pinniped or porpoise oil was on the air, but no obvious prey sharing was observed. The two new groups were travelling east roughly 400 m apart, the T037As (less T037A1) ahead of the T036s (less the T036As). These tight groups of five were soon joined from the northwest by the rarer visitors, who surfaced alongside the T036s for a sequence, before all dove and they reappeared alongside the T037As for a sequence. Shortly though, the T036s and T037As came together and the T134s and T237 dipped off to the southeast, still with greater pace.
With light waning and many miles between themselves and Victoria, Mark, Joe and Tasli ended the encounter just over four nautical miles southeast of where they began, and made tracks for Victoria at 1839.
Note: The relationship between the three outer-coastal Bigg’s killer whales is not known, but T134 is the presumed mother of the bull T132 given their long term association (since discovery). T237 may also be related, or may share a looser bond, similar to T002B’s association with the T060s.

We then went on with our day while waiting to see what the whales would do. Later in the afternoon, Dave called John Durban, who was out on their research boat “Helen”, and he said the Rosario whales had made it around Iceberg Point on Lopez Island and had met up with the L12s. L pod was now reported to be heading west in some nice groups. Since it was a very pretty evening and we needed some better shots on some L pod whales, the team mobilized and met down at Snug Harbor. We left the harbor at 1635 and eventually arrived on scene a couple few miles southwest of Eagle Point at 1720. The whales were headed back north toward San Juan Island and were very spread out in singles, pairs, and small groups. The whales were active and there was a lot of breaching and splashing. We had a brief pass by L103 and L118 while a larger active grouped passed by offshore. We also saw L124 and L125 playing together again. We approached the larger active group to find L105, L121, and L122 rolling around and interacting with one another right behind a fast-moving group that included L72, L77, L90, L91, and L119. L124 soon caught up to the group too. L119 did one bellyflop. Offshore of this group were the L86s. L86 and L125 were tight together while L106 was about a hundred yards to their east. L106 did a few taillobs but L125 was breaching like crazy and was flinging herself out of the water with wild abandon. 
We then moved inshore toward the area just south of False Bay. There were several whales spread out foraging whales in the area including L55, L113, L115, and L118. L113 and L115 rolled around together briefly and L113 breached twice. This group came together for a short time and gave us some nice lefts before milling and turning south. A couple of other whales, including L105, appeared nearby and all the whales in the area began heading down island in a loose group. Moving back offshore again we found L110 and L121 socializing together. Other whales including L94, L105, L113, and L115 showed up about ten minutes later and a group began to form. These whales did some milling but kept heading slowly south. We could see more whales loosely spread out a few hundred yards to the southeast. L55 and L109 were about a hundred yards west of a loose group that included L103, L123, L118 and L119. L77 and L124 were about a hundred yards in front of these whales. L55 and L109 briefly joined the L103s group before breaking off and spreading out again. After we got pictures of these whales, we went back north about a quarter of a mile to the group with L105 in it. This group had grown since we left it and now had all the L72s, L47s, and L94s in it. L110 and L121 were still socializing together right on the periphery of the group.

Since the day was a bit breezy, we decided to drive down the west side and catch the whales from shore. After getting down to Land Bank, we realized we must have missed the whales in the blind spot as they headed north so we walked right back to the car and came home. We made back to CWR in time to see a large group of whales heading north just south of Sunset Point. More whales could be seen off Bellevue Point. Andrews Bay was lumpier than the water off Land Bank but not as bad as the water off the south end of San Juan Island. It looked like the conditions might be better north of Mitchell Bay. The large front group was all of J pod and they charged right past the reef with lots of surface behaviors and splashing. We were able to get a photo of everyone in J pod from the porch except for J35, J57, and J53 as they headed north. After J pod disappeared around the corner, we could see that the Bellevue Point whales were now a little south of Sunset Point. As this group passed CWR in another large, and active group, we could see that it was all of L pod except for the L54s and L88.

We decided to go out and try to get some IDs of the L pod whales so we quickly headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1125. We saw whales in Mitchell Bay almost immediately and the encounter started at 1130 a little south of Kellett Bluff. L pod had spread out since they passed CWR and we saw several singles and loose pairs from Kellett Bluff to mid-Haro Strait. At the south end of the bluff, we saw L105 and L115 milling together. L83, L110 and maybe another one or two whales were also spread out near the bottom of Kellett. L85 and others were spread out farther offshore. We decided to head offshore while the inshore whales made their way around Kellett Bluff. We saw L121 but he was being difficult to photograph so we moved on to L85 offshore. L85 was relatively cooperative and we got a few rights on him while taking some proof of presence shots of more distant whales. To the northwest of L85 were other spread out whales. L124 and L125 were playing together but were being very difficult to photograph as the quick little whales zipped through less than calm seas. L119 was nearby and L77 and L86 were spread out west of the young whales. L103 and L118 were also out there in the direction of Halibut Island. We then began making our way back toward Henry Island, finding the sprouter L109 along the way. We then found L83 and L110 traveling slowly together offshore of Battleship Island. L110 is also now sprouting. Spread out and inshore of the L83s, were L55, L91, L122, and one or two others. L115 was behind them and we also caught a glimpse of L113 off the west end of Spieden Island. We then headed a little to the southwest where we saw a few milling whales. These whales went on a lengthy long dive and we got sidetracked by a bull to the northwest of us speeding north off of Tiptop Hill. We thought that was one of our L pod whales we were waiting for so we tried catching up to him. However, the bull turned out to be J38 so it looked like the leaders of the L pod whales were now bleeding into the trailers of J pod. J38 milled briefly like he might have been after a salmon and then we went looking for more L pod whales. After heading back south a bit, we found L25 traveling north by herself. It was nice to see L25 after not being able to find her on July 29th even though we had received a photo taken of her from shore that day by Sara Hysong-Shimazu. All the whales were still really spread out but we saw a few more whales closer to Stuart Island so we headed that way. We got on L105 again as he charged north. His mother, L72, also showed up briefly. We ended the encounter with the L72s off Tiptop Hill on Stuart Island at 1315.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-46

We got on scene offshore of American Camp at 1035 to find one small group of whales with a few outlying individuals milling in the area. L85 and L113 were seen so we knew we had the L12s, at least.

Around 1250 near the south end of False Bay, the L12s spread out again and began foraging. The L94s headed offshore and L121 breached once. By 1305, all the whales had turned south again. We ended the encounter at 1315 a little south of False Bay. Later, after we were already home, we found out that L88 and the L54s had been seen that day too.

We arrived on scene shortly afterwards at the north end of Mitchell Bay. A large group of J pod whales that included the J37s, J19, J45, J46, and a few others was milling vigorously. We stopped several hundred yards away due to another research boat being on the group while Dave looked at the whales through binocs and Stewart took a few photos. After determining that there were only J pod whales in the milling group, we left to find other whales. A quarter mile to the southwest of the milling group, J27 was traveling south by himself about a mile offshore. We got more photos of him to document his skinny condition before we moved on. 
Other whales could be seen traveling quickly down the San Juan Island shoreline and we decided to head down to Kanaka Bay and wait for the leaders to arrive. While we were waiting, we heard that the milling group of J pod whales we had seen earlier had actually been harassing a young harbor porpoise. Giles aboard the Wild Orca research vessel said that a little later, two of the whales were carrying the carcass with them as they headed down the west side. We began seeing whales around 1115 where we were and had several spread-out whales pass us in waves. J19 headed south near the SJI shoreline while J46 was offshore of her.

J38 foraged briefly off the bluff while J22 passed by offshore of him. J31, J56, and J56 were loosely spread out as they passed us closer to the rocks at Kellett. We ended the encounter at 1750 after these last three whales passed us at the north end of Mitchell Bay.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-42

Mark and Joe got word and departed Victoria on Mike 1 at 0805 to follow up. They had just passed the Haystock Islets, when a large bull surfaced a mile ahead. They reached the T060s at 0835 as they travelled restfully south-southwest in Parry Bay.
The Bigg’s were approaching Quarantine Cove when they began to increase their pace and deked left for the kelp beds along the shores of William Head Penitentiary. Several minutes of frenzied activity followed, and it was clear that several simultaneous attempts were made at seals in the shallows. The whales moved quickly on to the next small cove and worked their way into the north side of Pedder Bay like that for the next 30 minutes. Young T060G was particularly energetic and T060C’s large dorsal fin was kelp-laden on nearly every surfacing. The animals eventually moved off to the middle of Pedder Bay to share the spoils.
Only one prey-sharing event was observed to this point, though it seemed likely that at least one additional pinniped had fallen victim to the morning feeding by the time the Bigg’s rounded Cape Calver and left Pedder Bay. As the four moved on toward the south end of Vancouver Island, it was unclear whether they would cut through Eemdyk Pass, or round Bentinck Island to the south as many matrilines do. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given their morning antics, the group cruised quickly into the narrow – and very shallow, as the tide had just begun to rise – channel and resumed hunting. Several more seals were corralled out of the kelp beds, and the water was low enough that the 21-year-old bull could not fully submerge; the top half of his dorsal fin was visible for nearly 200 metres of transit across the shallow bottom. He nabbed one more seal with his mother and younger siblings as they exited the pass into deeper water.
As the animals reentered the Juan de Fuca, they briefly prey-shared in the company of three Caspian terns before a spyhop from T060 declared it was time to move along, and they continued around Christopher Point and west along the Vancouver Island shore. Mark and Joe ended the encounter there at 0956 and returned to Victoria.
Note: Brothers T060D and T060E were not present, and have been seen with the group only sparingly in the years since dispersing in August 2019, just prior to the birth of T060G. Late afternoon reports from commercial whale-watchers placed the whales reaching Jordan River, BC by 1700, over 20 nautical miles from where Mark and Joe had left them.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-41

We rounded Turn Point but it took a little time to spot our first whale about a half mile northeast of the lighthouse and the encounter started at 1825. The whales seemed to be very, very spread out but we had an initial small group and a couple of individuals porpoising toward the point. J19 was the first whale to pass us and the J41s porpoised past Turn Point nearer to the rocks. It took us another ten minutes or so to find our next whale. This was J47 and he was traveling quickly west along Stuart Island’s north shoreline near the west end of Prevost Harbor. J46 also appeared closer to shore and she stopped and milled briefly before continuing west. Several minutes later we found J42 heading southwest down Boundary by herself but were not seeing any other whales. We did a big loop up Boundary Pass past Blunden Island but could not find anymore whales so we headed back toward Turn Point to see if we could re-locate the leaders. By 1925, we were back off the point and had a few spread out whales just south of the point and one or two just north of it. J36 was the whale who appeared under the bluff and it was J42, again, behind her. Both whales were milling and appeared to be foraging. We caught a glimpse of a backlit J39 passing offshore of us but did not get a photo of him. There was an adult male north of Turn Point at the time too. This was J26 and he turned west and headed offshore. We also saw a small group to the northwest of J26 milling off the stern of a freighter. The group of four surfaced after a long dive traveling south mid-Haro Strait. This was the J35s and J44 and they were surfacing about once every twenty seconds on their short dives. There were a couple of other spread whales to the west of us but we weren’t seeing a lot of whales. We concluded that K pod was not present or at least not close enough to find before we lost our daylight. Our little group spread out and started porpoising south. We ended the encounter at 2005 about three quarters of a mile east of Tom Point on Gooch Island with what whales we could see spread out and porpoising south.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-40

Since J, K, and L pods had spent the previous day up near the Fraser River, and this was probably them coming back down, the team mobilized and left Snug Harbor in the boat at 0910. Hoping to catch the whales in Boundary Pass, we went through Johns Pass. We got a report that the leaders were passing Turn Point so we turned west after exiting Johns Pass. We saw our first whales about three quarters of a mile northeast of Turn Point and the encounter started at about 0935. The first group we saw included the K16s, J45, and L106 and they were heading southwest toward Turn Point but then took a hard left and headed toward the north shoreline of Stuart Island. Behind this group we found another large group of J pod whales that included all the J16s, J22s, J37s, plus J46 and J53. This group was very active as they headed southwest toward Turn Pt. and there were several breaches (one by J38) and cartwheels along with other splashy behavior. 

We moved off to let these groups go around the lighthouse and then headed to another group who had already rounded the point. This was another active group that included the J35s and the K22s. Nearby were other whales loosely spread out in singles and pairs including L87 and L90 who were interacting with one another. The L83s and L86s were also in the area and all these whales formed one loose, socially active group as they headed south. Behind them was a similar spread of small groups and individuals. The J31s and J40 formed one small tight group with the K14s sprinkled around them. J27 was following these whales and the K35s with J51 were following him. We then saw J44 and L106 traveling quickly together while, farther offshore on the Canadian side of the strait, J16 and J26 were traveling tightly together. Behind the loose group by a few hundred yards was another group of J pod whales that included the J19s, J37s, J39, J42, J46, and J53. One of the last whales we saw north of Henry Island was J38 and he was foraging by himself on the Canadian side of the strait.

We left J38 at about 1110, pulled wide, and headed south far offshore while the whales traveled down the west side of San Juan Island. We parked ourselves down by Kanaka Bay and waited for the whales to arrive as they bucked an incoming tide for almost an hour and a half. Eventually, we saw a few scattered whales off Pile Point including the K14s, K34, and L91. Off the south end of False Bay, we saw L55 and L109 chase a salmon. After L55 and L109, we saw a few spread individuals and a couple more pairs including L72 and L105 who were heading south. We then found J40 and K36 but they turned west. After them, we found K34 again and he was traveling southwest and offshore. We followed him for several surfacing’s as he was being cooperative and predictable. As K34 headed offshore, we saw another active group that included the L72s, L91s, and K27. K34 soon joined them. These whales were social, milling, and non-directional at the time. L105 was particularly active and was doing half breaches repeatedly. We left this group to check out a smaller group to the north of them and this was all three of the L86s traveling together. We got photos of the L86s and then went back to the larger group. The larger group was still very active and several members of the group breached. L123 and L103 had joined them while we were there. This group turned south-southwest and spread out some. 

We then headed southeast to find more whales. We made it to an area several miles southwest of Eagle Point but could only find a minke (or maybe two) down there. We moved back toward False Bay and found a few random individuals before finding another tight, social group that included the J35s, K22s, J46, J53, and K43. This group was pointed south. We saw some more individuals and pairs that we had already seen as we worked our way north. Off the north end of False Bay we finally found the K20s with the new calf K45. The group was tight and moving slow with some milling. K45 looks like a normal, healthy calf but both K20 and K38 looked skinnier than usual. We will try to keep an eye on this situation as the summer progresses. After the K20s, we saw L86 and L125 again and then ended the encounter at about 1745 a couple of miles of False Bay after J37 and J59 passed us heading south.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-39

After a scan in Race Pass, the crew angled offshore from Beechey Head and continued west along the north edge of the traffic separation scheme. Shortly after passing Otter Point, Gary spotted some activity to the south at 0647. As they closed the gap, it became clear that he had spied a juvenile killer whale with another rolling playfully alongside it! They quickly confirmed that the two animals were T065B1 and B2, and soon observed T065B travelling slowly just 300 metres southeast of them.

All of the whales were eastbound, the kids with decidedly more energy than the restful matriarch. The two were travelling side-by-side, surfacing with gusto though not making any more pace than mom, and T065B1 was observed rolling and surfacing belly-up several times throughout the encounter.

As the whales continued east, with no signs of predation or other whales in the vicinity, the crew ended the encounter at 0727 and continued west.

Mark was the first to spot the whales, just northeast of Race Rocks and the encounter began at 1421.

The first whale to appear was L91! She was travelling northeast, with an array of animals to the west of her. From the number of dorsal fins, it seemed likely that more than one pod was present and this suspicion was confirmed moments later by a quick pass from K27 on Mike 1's port side.

The team began making their way south toward a larger group in hopes of locating the calf that had been reported with K pod in an encounter off the Oregon coast in April.

On the way, Brendon spotted a couple of whales with what appeared to be a young calf and Mark adjusted course for further inspection. Sure enough, these whales turned out to be K38 and his mother, K20, along with a little calf! The young whale surfaced once for every two breaths from its mother, so a couple surfacings passed before the team was able to successfully photograph the calf.

After taking a few shots of the calf’s right side, the team set their sights back to the sizable group to the south. These whales were identified as the K12s and the remainder of the K13s, along with the L72s, L86s, L91s, L87 and K35.

Joe then pointed out another group of whales, which included J38. Mike 1 slowly repositioned and, at 1520, located most of J pod in a tight group, less J44 and the J35s. Behind them by a few hundred meters were the K14s and the missing J35s.

Once proof-of-presence photos were taken, Mike 1 turned west to find the trailing whales and wrap up the encounter. The first pair of whales that were spotted were L103 and L123, circling. The two whales slowed and joined the rest of the L4s, who were pushing east quickly. The L72s and L87 were also in the mix again, suggesting they’d turned back to join their fellow pod members. Shortly after finding this group, they became active when the wake of a nearby freighter passed over them; L83 cartwheeled, L106 began porpoising and L118 tail-slapped twice!

The Mike 1 crew decided to take one final look at some of the eastern groups to see if they could find any of the missing individuals. They were able to add K16 to the total before one final look at K20 and her new calf. The encounter ended at 1615 with the K12s, K13s and K16s moving east quickly with the flood.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-37

About a half an hour later, we saw our first whale about 3 miles southwest of Eagle Point and the encounter began at 1518. This was L85 and he was traveling north back toward San Juan Island. The rest of the L12s also showed up and were spread out in singles, pairs, and the L94s were in a group of three. The whales spread out even more off False Bay and began foraging. For the next couple of hours, the L12s foraged back and forth between Pile Point and the south end of False Bay. 
Earlier, we had heard that J pod was coming down Boundary Pass. Around 1815, the L12s began acting like they might be hearing J pod and began heading north to greet them.

Jeanne said that (and photographed) both groups lined up and were facing each other in greeting ceremony fashion before they merged. The team mobilized and left Snug Harbor in the boat at 1015. We saw our first whales just a little south of False Bay and the encounter began at 1044. We had a nice line up of L22, L25, L85, L113, and L121 moving slowly south. Other whales could be seen spread out farther offshore and to the southwest. Around 1115, most of J pod surfaced after a long dive in one big tight group. This large group started moving slowly north but were not arching much at all so we moved back to a few stragglers after getting a few photos of the big group. The whales trailing the main group by a couple of hundred yards were J27, J44, and J45. By 1140, the large group had made it to Pile Point and the trailing threesome joined them. We stayed with this group long enough to make sure we got a picture of everyone in J pod and determine that there were no Ls in the group. 
We then headed back south to see if we could find our missing L12s. We found our original group of five plus L94, who had joined them while we had been gone, off the south end of False Bay. The group was traveling slowly north for about ten minutes before milling briefly and then turning back south. Around this time, Straitwatch, who were to our southwest, said they had seen three whales out near them. We went on a 20 minute search out that way and then a loop down near Eagle Point but could not find who Straitwatch saw. Our group of L12s had split up at this point and were foraging as they moved south. We were calling it quits and putting away our cameras when Rachel saw a whale offshore of us. This had to be the L77s, we thought, so we went that direction. Sure enough, we finally found L77 and L124 who were traveling south together while L119 paralleled them about 150 yards away to the east.

J pod had moved up the west side and we thought we might take another look at them on our way to the Roche Harbor fuel dock. We got back on J pod at 1440 just after they had passed Kellett Bluff.

We finally saw blows a little south of False Bay and the encounter started at 0952.
The first whales we saw were heading toward the San Juan Island shoreline and were backlit but their dorsal fin shapes did not look like J pod whales. This was L22, L25, L85, L94, and L113. J47 was nearby and J39 was inshore of the group. J38 also showed up out of nowhere and joined J47 and the L12s. J44 also showed up. These whales were acting social and there was a lot of milling and splashing. There was another social group a few hundred yards to the north of us and other whales were spread out peripherally in singles and small groups. J44 joined a few of these peripheral whales (the J31s and his little sister J53) on their way north towards the other social group. J44 and J53 joined the group while the J31s passed through it and headed slowly northwest. The rest of the socializing group was all of the J16s plus J22, J35, J40, J45, J46, J49, J51, and J57. Like the other group, these whales were socializing with lots of splashing and surface behavior. Even J56 breached a couple of times as she and her mom passed the group.
We moved back and forth between the two groups a couple times to see if any of the other L12s had joined up with them, while also checking on a couple of single animals in the general area. By the time the northern group (but not the northern most whales) made it to Pile Point, most of the whales in the area turned and began heading back down island. Both groups dissipated a little although there were still milling and socializing whales. Peripheral whales could have been foraging. We found L121 socializing with J44 but were still looking for any of the L77s who should have been around with the rest of the L12s. We headed north towards Hannah Heights with hopes of finding the L77s with the leaders who were coming down. We found J41 with J58 and J37 with J59 heading south in two pairs plus a couple other J pod whales we had seen already that day but no L77s. We then headed back south again to see if we could find them down there. We found most of the whales we had seen earlier between Kanaka Bay and the area just north of Eagle Point.

T75 appeared near Battleship and headed west toward her family members and soon joined them. 

After two series of surfacing’s, T75 and T75A stayed down for some extra time on a long dive and finally came up a couple of hundred yards to the west of where the others had been. On the next series, all the whales turned west towards Mandarte Island with T75 and T75A trailing the others by about 150 yards.

It sounded that is was likely a group of Bigg's but then he had an updated report which contradicted his thoughts that they were possible Residents so he made his way to town to mobilize Mike 1.
On route he got confirmation that it was a spread out group of Bigg's moving quickly east and were now close to Race Rocks. 
He departed Victoria harbour at 1100 and came across the T075B's and C's at 1136 south west of Constance Bank. They were separated in their respective families by no more than a .25nm traveling at a steady 6 knots to the east with the flood. Within a few minutes he had decent enough photos of all six individuals so he continued on to find the rest. One of the whale watchers had confirmed the T123's along with a few others but they hadn't been seen since the group had split up west of Race Rocks. T063 along with his probable mom, T065 were reported ~ 5 nm to the south west of the T075B's and C's so Mark headed that way. 
At 1158 he came across the pair separated by .5nm slowly SSE bound ~ 5nm SSE of Race Rocks. T065 was to the south of T063 and at one point it looked as though she was slowly chasing a likely seal or harbour porpoise as she had quickened her pace with a direction change to the south and T063 changed his course towards her. This was short lived as they turned back to their SSE track without joining for prey sharing and no signs of T065 eating. Mark departed inside 30 minutes once he had proof of presence photos of both T063 and T065 and headed back in the direction of the T075B's and C's who were now close to 10 nm ahead. 
At 1243 he arrived back with the T075B's and C's ~ 7nm south of Trial Island. They were now grouped up moving very slowly east towards Hein Bank. At 1320 they predated on what appeared to be a seal at 48 18.5/123 10.2 and prey shared for the next 15 minutes. 
As Mark was scanning with binoculars in all directions with hopes to find the 3rd missing group with the T123's he got word that killer whales were found by one of the commercial whale watch boats ~7 nm to the NW near Trial Island moving NE towards Discovery Island. As he was approaching Discovery Island he got word that they had been confirmed as the T123's along with the T041's so he had a very brief look at the group in order to get proof of presence pictures of them and ended the encounter at 1410 ~ NE of Seabird Point, Discovery Island as they continued NE towards San Juan Island.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2020-31

The T146s are infrequent visitors to the Salish Sea, having most often been encountered near Haida Gwaii and on the outer coast. 
Mark and Brenden mobilized Mike 1 and departed Victoria harbour at 1715. They arrived on scene with the whales at 1733 south of Trial Island as they were traveling quickly east with the flood. Based on the sheer number of whales, it was assumed that most, if not all, of the T146s, were present – including T146D, who stranded on Prince of Wales Island in Alaska in the summer of 2021. 
Mark repositioned the vessel to the right of the animals to account for the backlighting on the whales’ left sides, and after a good look, it was clear that T146D was not present…but coincidentally, another former strandee whale was! Brendon reviewed his photos and recognized the small nick on the trailing edge of one of the female’s dorsal fins to be consistent with T046C2, a 13-year-old female who was successfully rescued after becoming trapped in a bay off Aristazabal Island back in 2013.
Mike 1 ended the encounter at 1759 ~4 nm south of Discovery Island after taking some decent right-side pictures.

In their first flight, the team found the J37s (including new calf J59), along with the J17s and J51, who was in full social mode away from the rest of his matriline. The whales seemed to be focused on socializing, particularly the young whales, with J57 and J59 being particularly active.

The whales grouped up a bit as they moved north towards Lime Kiln. The team cut off shore as the whales approached the park and waited for them further up island. When the team resumed their flights, the group had been joined by the rest of the J19s, the rest of J14s, as well as the J16s.

While still in a fairly tight group, the whales had settled more into a travelling and resting pattern, with less intense socializing. J19 was generally in the lead, and the J16s positioned themselves slightly off from the rest of the group.

As the whales continued past San Juan County Park, the J19s pulled further ahead and away from the rest of the group.

As the team came out of Active Pass, they saw a single adult male in the distance. This adult male turned out to be J26, foraging all alone. The team stayed with him for several minutes, scanning the horizon for the rest of the pod to no success. After several minutes, the team left J26 to search for the rest of the pod. Over the next two hours, the team ran several transect lines around J26, dropping the hydrophone several times, but never detected any other whales visually or acoustically.

The rest of the group was near the reef, apparently hunting seals. The team got in position and launched the drone to start behavioural observations.

The whales spread out and moved east, splitting first into two groups. The lead group was composed of the T37s, travelling extremely spread out. The team dropped back to the trailers, and first found T34 travelling with T34B, porpoising towards the leaders. The whales eventually slowed down, and were joined by another whale, T34A. The team took a few photographs during this period to identify the whales involved while on scene, but primarily focused on behavioural observations with the drone.

From the drone, the team observed T34A bring a seal to the other two T34s, first passing the seal to T34, who then immediately passed the prey item to T34B. The whales milled, sharing and processing the kill, for several minutes before heading towards the Barnes Island shoreline.

As the whales approached the island, they picked up some speed and clustered into a single group. The team continued to follow the whales as they made their way towards Rosario Strait.

It was reported that another group joined the first and that all the whales were milling and feeding in the vicinity of O’Neal Island. It was pretty breezy in Haro Strait but the whales were not far away so Dave headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1255. “Orcinus” got on scene around 1320 about a quarter mile north of O’Neal Island. The whales, previously identified as the T65As and the T123s, were still milling and feeding near the same spot where they had been found over an hour earlier. There was a large blubber oil slick with lots of gulls flying overhead and swooping down to pick up scraps or dip the oil. Most of the whales seemed to be milling in the same area although one of the boats reported seeing a single animal near the O’Neal Island shoreline. The group would go down for their long dive at the same time to feed although some whales came up before others. Early in the encounter, T65A2 and T123A briefly split from the others and moved over toward the north shoreline of O’Neal Island for one series of surfacings. When they came up from their long dive, the pair was already heading back toward the other milling whales. T123A breached once and then did a couple of taillobs as the two of them rejoined the others.
For the next hour and a half, the whales continued to mill and feed without going anywhere although they did drift southeast down San Juan Channel a little. No carcass was ever seen but whatever they killed and were eating was big enough for ten whales to feed on for hours. The encounter ended at 1515 as the slick was dissipating near the south end of Rocky Bay with the whales still milling. As “Orcinus” was leaving the area and heading home, it was reported over the radio that the whales had finally finished feeding and were heading down San Juan Channel.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-17

The first whale was seen near shore off the lime kiln just north of Lime Kiln State Park and this turned out to be J19. The encounter started at 1308. It was over fifteen minutes before another whale could be found and approached close enough to photograph. This was J39 traveling by himself at least a half mile west-southwest of J19. The SR3 drone project boat was another mile or more to the west and a blow or two could be seen out there. The SR3 boat moved off to whales even further west and “Orcinus” headed toward the whales they had left. This was a loose group of five that included the J22s, the J31s, and J27 and they were traveling up mid-Haro Strait. Another group appeared another quarter mile west of the previous group. This was an active group that appeared to be chasing a fish when first seen but it quickly turned into a social group of rolling tactile whales. This roll-y group included J40, J42, J46, J49, and J53. These whales were on the Kelp Reef line and were angled just slightly west of the reef. J36 was seen peripherally to this group and J37 and her new calf J59 were also glimpsed to the north of the group and heading west. The socializing group disappeared briefly as a freighter passed by heading south. As “Orcinus” turned to face the freighter’s wake, a dorsal fin tip or two could be seen zipping along the surface as several of the whales surfed back south in the ship’s wake. When the whales regrouped after their surfing safari, J37 and J59 had showed up again with J40 close beside them. J46 and J49 joined the threesome while J42 and J53 wandered off although J42 soon came back and joined the group again. This group traveled west-northwest and passed Kelp Reef on the west side. Some other whales appeared about a quarter mile east of the previous group. This was the J22s again and they were spread out from one another as they headed up Haro Strait. J36 and J53 hurried by tight together too. Also nearby were J31 and J56 who were loosely spread. As “Orcinus” headed back east across the strait, another group appeared about a third of a mile east of the J31s and this was the J35s and J51. This group of four was socializing and tactile while they traveled slowly up mid-Haro Strait. The last whales of the day were four more spread out whales almost three quarters of a mile to the southeast of the J35s and J51. Three of these were J26, J44, and J45 and they were traveling almost abreast but spread out by several hundred yards. J26 was about two hundred yards west of J45 who was about fifty yards west of J44 and they were all traveling up Haro in a business-like manner. The fourth whale showed up again behind them and this was J27. He had stalled out to chase a fish and the encounter ended with him at 1630 halfway between the north end of Andrews Bay and Kelp Reef.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-16

While they were stopped just south of Race Rocks having a binocular scan, they received a report that some killer whales were spotted near Constance Bank. Mark called their friend and colleague Gord Rowles to have a look from his 23rd apartment, Crow's Nest, while they headed towards the bank. As they looped over the southern edge of Constance Bank, George spotted a blow, and they were able to quickly confirm it was a Gray whale. They then received word from Gord that he spotted killer whales at the western edge of Constance Bank, moving west a couple of miles to the north of Mike 1. 
As they approached, they could see a tight group of animals with a large bull moving quickly west.
They stopped to wait for the next dive cycle as the whales approached them. The following dive sequence put the whales a few metres abeam of them. Mark immediately recognized the bull T049C and a group of recently regularly sighted animals in the area, the T030B's, T117B, and T172. 
As several commercial whale watch boats were arriving from both San Juan Island and Victoria with hopes to get a quick look at the killer whales late in their trips, the Mike 1 crew decided to temporarily leave the animals to allow the other boats the best viewing opportunities possible.
Mike 1 returned at 1340 as the whales were ~ 1 nm south of Race Rocks, now spread out and tracking southwest towards the middle of the Juan de Fuca Strait. 
As the whales got out near the strait's center, they turned west and continued their quick pace of 7 - 8 knots.

We arrived on scene near the bottom of President Channel and the encounter started at 1322. J pod was very spread out and it was not easy to find any whales at the beginning of the encounter. We briefly saw J38, J31, and J51 all traveling south by themselves as they rounded the west side of Jones Island. J36 milled near us before moving on after the others. We eventually found a group on the north shoreline of Jones Island and this was all of the J17s. The J17s traveled southeast through Spring Passage in a tight group before milling and spreading out. Since we were hoping to find the J37s with the new calf, we left the J17s and headed southeast down San Juan Channel toward some distant whales we thought might be the leaders, passing the J31s on the way. The group we headed towards turned out to be the J41s speeding down the channel. We could see a couple of whales, including a male, south of them but thought this might be members of the J16s. Right when we almost turned back to see if the J37s were behind us, Katie saw more whales down the channel toward the west tip of Shaw Island. We went there and, luckily, this turned out to be the J37s. The calf was still there and was keeping up with its mom as she traveled quickly down SJ Channel. J49 was also present and J40 soon joined them too. When we were sure we got good right side eyepatches on the calf, we left them off Parks Bay and started slowly motoring back northwest. We passed J39 and, a little afterwards, found J44 and J53 rolling around together. We ended the encounter with them at 1511 about midway between Pt. Caution and the west end of Shaw Island. We had put our gear away and started to get on our way home when we found one last whale bringing up the rear. This was J45 and he’s looking like it won’t be long before he begins sprouting.

It was really foggy in the area so going out at that time wasn’t an option but there was hope that it would clear later. Dave headed over to the CWR office to do various stuff. Around 1045, about two hours after the original sighting, Jane Cogan texted to say she was hearing SR calls on the hydrophone. The fog was clearing so Dave started to gear up in hopes of catching the whales still north of Mitchell Bay. However, while loading the car, blows were heard and whales were seen already south of CWR plunging toward Bellevue Point. Dave decided to try to get photos from shore instead and drove to Lime Kiln. There was a large group at least a mile and a half offshore of the park heading southwest toward another fog bank. The photos had a lot of heat haze (it was a warm day for the first of March) but J38 and J39 could be identified at least. Since it looked like J pod was heading out, Dave went back to CWR and got on with the rest of the day. 

Later that afternoon, while back at home, Dave received a series of calls from Lodie Gilbert relaying messages from Sara Hysong-Shimazu that the whales were still on the westside and that she had seen a possible new calf with J37 from shore at Land Bank. J pod was also now heading north again. Dave then scrambled and headed to Snug Harbor and left in the boat around 1635. About ten minutes later, whales were seen off Bellevue Point. The first whales were in a tight and active group that appeared to be socializing. This group included the J19s, the J16s minus J26, and J22 and they were all rolling and tactile as they headed north past the County Park. A couple of single whales, including J47, were offshore of the larger group. J38 was seen at least a mile away to the northwest of the others. Since the J37s were not in this group and time was a factor due to failing daylight, Dave called Monika to get a bit more info on where Sara had seen the J37s in relation to the J16s and J19s group. Monika relayed that Sara had said the J37s and J40 were ahead and offshore of the larger group. Dave looked through his binocs and saw some distant blows all the way across the strait in the direction of Kelp Reef and headed that way, passing J35 and J57 along the way. The distant group turned out to be exactly who was being looked for as it was J40 traveling with the J37s and they were maybe a half mile east of Kelp Reef. J37s new calf was sighted immediately although it took several surfacings to properly photograph the quick little whale. The calf appears to be pretty young as it is still a little lumpy. The dorsal fin was upright which means the calf is over a day old but, due to its “lizard head” look, it is probably younger than a couple of weeks. Usually, new calves start filling out behind their blowhole after their third week. The calf appears to have a closed saddle on its left side with a hint of a black spine and a tiny finger. The J37s and J40 continued north in a tight group although they occasionally zig-zagged a little. Around 1720, all three of the J35s joined the J37s and J40 and the group of seven continued up Haro Strait with a few zigs and zags to the northwest and back north towards Kellett Bluff.

At 1301 as Mike 1 entered the south entrance to Sidney Channel, Mark spotted the animals milling roughly where they were reported an hour prior. The whales were well spread, and T137A surfaced nearby to give away the ecotype as Bigg’s. The animals were clearly hunting a harbour seal, and it seemed possible that there were two simultaneous predations taking place. This suspicion was confirmed after watching the animals for a few minutes while collecting acoustic recordings from the periphery.
Shortly, the guys noted a bold Steller sea lion approach from the south, perhaps having been flushed north by T137A and his one or two cohorts, who were now well south of the action. He seemed to escape relatively unscathed, though T137D did take a brief interest, taking two swipes at it before returning to the scene of one of the harbour seal predations. The two loose groups of killer whales took down their prey almost simultaneously and the prey sharing commenced.
T036B1 had not yet been seen, but Joe had earlier noted a single animal across the Channel travelling steadily north, so Mike 1 trolled away from the feeding aggregation and they sought her out. They found her nearly a mile north of the other whales, milling, and after documenting her presence they watched her rejoin the others, now also making their way steadily north from the predation and spread into two tight groups; the T137s and T036 were slightly north and inshore of the T099s and the T036Bs.

Most of J pod was in one large resting group closer to the Orcas Island shoreline while J38, J44, and J45 were rolling around and socializing together a few hundred yards to the southeast. Around 1445, just before coming around the point to the east of the Orcas Island ferry landing, the large group began waking up and spreading out.

They proceeded to the traffic lanes south of Sea Bird Point, Discovery Island and stopped for a scan. They were preparing to continue the search when Mark spotted a series of dorsal fins just to the east. The encounter began at 1012 with a large group of Bigg’s killer whales travelling quickly into Haro Strait.
The whales dove as the Mike 1 crew slowed and when they resurfaced, Joe quickly recognized the trailing animal as T117A, a wandering bull last seen by CWR staff in late 2019 in the western reaches of the Juan de Fuca Strait (see Encounter #99, 2019). The others remained a momentary mystery, though by the time the whales next dove the trio had identified members of the T086A and T124D matrilines, along with T124A1. A quick reference to the DFO Bigg’s catalogue then confirmed their suspicion that the remaining animals were the entirety of the T071 matriline, a rarely encountered group in the Salish Sea! T124D was also travelling with a young calf, which would be her third known offspring of the 25-year-old matriarch.
The whales were travelling steadily north-northeast, seemingly disinterested in the large bull sea lions sitting atop Brinn Rock off the south end of Discovery Island, but quickly zigged to the east and porpoised for a minute or so before slowing. Brian keenly noticed that one of the females was travelling with prey in her jaw, and it is possible that this is what caught the whales’ attention and caused their change in travel direction. No prey sharing was observed, and the whales continued into Haro Strait, while the Mike 1 crew ended the encounter and headed for the warmth of Victoria.

Kelley and Katie were busy that Saturday morning so Dave collected his stuff and headed to Snug Harbor. Dave left Snug at 1040 and headed north toward Stuart Island, arriving on scene off Tiptop Hill on Stuart Island at 1106. The whales were so spread out that there were hardly any whales in sight. Dave got a dot shot on a sprouter almost a mile to the east and then took a few shots of a single cryptic, backlit whale that turned out to be L116. It was another twenty minutes before another whale could be found and this was L118 traveling south by herself maybe about a mile and a half west of Battleship Island. Dave then moved southeast toward Kellett Bluff where he had seen a blow in the distance. This turned out to be L82 and she was also traveling slowly south before she turned northeast and began milling. A little later, L116 showed up and he and L82 traveled slowly south together loosely spread out off of north Kellett Bluff. Dave then back-tracked north a little until a spread out female and sprouter appeared north of Kellett Bluff. This was L55 and L109 and they came together as they traveled south along the bluff. When these two made it to the north end of Mitchell Bay, Dave began slowly working his way west to see who was on the other side of Haro Strait. Near the south end of Mitchell Bay, L116 started chasing a salmon while L82 continued slowly south nearby.
All the way on the other side of Haro Strait, about a quarter mile east of Kelp Reef, L87 and L90 were traveling about fifty yards apart from one another. These two spread out some more and Dave moved a few hundred meters to the west and L105 appeared. He milled briefly before fast traveling south. L72 showed up about a hundred yards ahead of L105. Dave began heading back east in hopes of finding new whales and saw L87 again. After spending a few minutes with L87 as he cruised south, there were no more whales in sight who were not all the way over on the SJI shoreline. Dave headed southeast towards False Bay but did not see any whales for about twenty five minutes. Two whales were then seen a little to the southwest and this was L72 and L105 again. The L72s cruised south steadily and were relatively cooperative. L90 appeared again and was about a hundred and fifty meters to the east of the L72s. She eventually joined them briefly before splitting off again. L90 currently has the sway-backed look she has had in the past when we have suspected her to be pregnant. After leaving the L72s, Dave headed inshore and pointed toward the area between the south end of False Bay and Eagle Point. The L86s had been reported inshore so that was the best chance of finding whales that had not been photographed yet. On the way over that direction, L91 and L122 showed up a little less than two miles southwest of False Bay. These two were loosely spread and heading south. About a quarter mile east of them L83 and L110 showed up traveling slowly south tightly together with Mt Baker in the background. 

While with the L83s at 1425, a male and maybe a couple others appeared about a half mile to the south. And then a group appeared about a quarter mile south of the male. It looked like a good sized group-too big to be the remaining L pod whales who had been inshore. The male passed heading north a couple hundred yards away and it was L85. The L12s had arrived and must have come in from the west. The group was a large, tight group of socializing Ls. Present were L22, L77, L124, L82, and L116 in one tight group and nearby were other socializing whales. The L72s, L83s, L91s, L25, and L119 were just a little behind the first group. L85, L87 and L90 also showed up and were in the mix. The socializing whales were going on lengthy long dives of ten minutes or more and often moved around unpredictably during that time. The socializing groups had individuals join and drift off for the rest of the encounter as they all moved southwest. There were multiple larger groups and many peripheral individuals and pairs. One of these socializing pairs was L110 and L119 with L110 very excitedly chasing L119 around. The encounter ended at 1610 about halfway between Middle Bank and the northern part of Hein Bank with the whales still heading southwest. 

The L54s and L88 were not present during this encounter. Everybody else in L pod was photographed by the end of the day with the exception of L89. Our friend and colleague Jared Towers had had the L12s up off northern Vancouver Island in front of Alert Bay on January 13th and L89 had not been present then either. L89 was last seen on November 5th, 2021 and he looked normal at that time. This is worrisome but we will continue looking for L89 until the rest of the southern residents are thoroughly documented in 2022.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-6

The first stop was Race Pass, and after scanning with binoculars for a few minutes, Tasli spotted a distant Killer Whale fin out in the middle of Juan de Fuca Strait. Upon approach, the whales could be identified as the T100 matriline, a family of 4 whales. The encounter began at 10:25 just as the whales were beginning to hunt a Harbour Seal ~ 3 nm SSE of Beechey Head. The whales were at the surface with their prey and trying to subdue it, with T100C and T100E doing the majority of the physical work, swiping their flukes and caudal peduncle at the Harbour Seal while mom (T100) and her youngest offspring, T100F circled close-by. After 10 minutes of pursuit, T100E grabbed the seal and dragged it under, at which point the whales began prey sharing and traveling quickly to the west.

They were not hearing anything on the Lime Kiln hydrophone suggesting the whales were coming down from the north. The day was windy and there was a small craft advisory in the San Juans so, while it was not going to be a day to go out, there might be a chance to get some photos from shore. Dave arrived at CWR about a half hour later and he and Kelley went to the porch to see if any whales could be spotted. Haro Strait was pretty nasty looking-not necessarily death defying in the north part of Andrews Bay but sloppy enough to look like a good day to stay ashore. There were also a lot of logs out there. We finally saw some whales at least a mile offshore in the direction of D’Arcy Island and they looked to be milling or heading back north. We saw some more whales a little farther away in the same direction and suddenly there was good number of whales spread out in the same general area. The whales were too far away to ID but we saw at least two adult males plus a suspicious looking young sprouter that didn’t really look like J pod whale. The whales were definitely pointed back north and traveling with the seas. Reasoning that the water wasn’t THAT bad and might be better north of Kellett Bluff, Kelley and Dave decided to give it a try and go see if it was more than just J pod out there. We then headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1100.

We headed west in Mitchell Bay and saw our first whales about a quarter mile south of Kellett Bluff. J26 was seen but not photographed. The water was not better north of CWR and we knew it was going to get worse as we got closer to the tidal slop near Kellett Bluff. Photography was put on hold for a few minutes while we followed the whales through the four foot standing waves at Kellett. The water got marginally better north of the bluff and we were able to catch up to the whales we had kept in sight. It was hard to stand up much less getting a good visual ID while trying to keep the whales in the frame but photos revealed the first three whales we got photos of were J22, J31, and L109. We saw an open saddled male-smaller than J26- behind us that we figured was L105 so we knew we probably had the L4s, L47s, L72s, L87, and L90 somewhere around, at least. L105 soon showed up and traveled loosely with J22. L90 was also in the area. L105 caught a wave and surfed away with water flying off his dorsal fin. He then disappeared and we looked for other whales. L90 joined J22 and those two traveled tightly together for a brief while. L72 was about a hundred meters to the west of them. We then moved up ahead and to the west a little and found two loosely spread mom/calf pairs. This was J35 with J57 and L86 with L125. These whales then spread out a little and headed northwest with J57 and L125 charging around together. L87 suddenly appeared on our port side and J45 was also nearby. J27 showed up two hundred yards or so to our east at the same time and water streamed behind his dorsal as he surfed a wave for a moment. We were somewhere around mid-Haro Strait by this point-between Gooch Island and Tiptop Hill on Stuart Island. We moved east toward Stuart Island and got on a newly formed tight group of four that included the J22s and the L83s. We could see another group forming closer to Turn Point and went there next. We saw the sprouter L109 again and then a tight socializing group that included J40, J42, J46, J53, L103, L118, and L123. This group logged briefly and was tactile. There was another small group nearer to the point that had at least J41 in it but we could not get to them before they disappeared into rougher water. While the water had improved slightly nearer to Stuart Island, there was an ugly tide rip with lots of big logs about a half mile north of Turn Point so we were not going any further. There was one group still behind us so we waited for them to pass us by. J16 passed by followed by J36 who blew a nice rainbow. They were followed by L05 and J44 who were traveling together as they passed us. We ended the encounter there at Turn Point at 1243 with the whales heading northwest toward Swanson Channel. We went home via Boundary Pass and Johns Pass to avoid the bulk of the lumpy seas blowing up Haro Strait. It was a wet, rocking and rolling day, though, and we had to clean a lot of salt out of our ears when we got home.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-4

Visibility was improving after a day and a half of thick fog in the region, and there was little breeze forecasted. At approximately 1145 the trio stopped for a scan just south of Otter Point and in the calm seas Joe was able to spot a tight group of killer whales roughly a mile to the west of the boat!
They began the encounter at 1152 and slowly approached several killer whales clearly in the midst of a sea lion predation. The animals were quickly identified as members of the T030 and T041 matrilines, not an uncommon association. The T030s are not as common as they once were in the inside waters of the Salish Sea, and have not been seen in the Juan de Fuca Strait for quite some time, though the T041s are relatively common in the western and central portions of the Strait in late summer each year.
The animals pursued the young Steller sealion for a few hundred meters before corralling it and commencing the physical portion of the hunt. T041 and T030A moved off to the periphery of the fray while T030 and T041A took their offspring through the motions. T041A3 in particular seemed to remain engaged with the Steller while the other four would circle away before returning to deliver a few blows, then repeat the cycle. This continued for quite some time, before T030A and T041 seemingly ran out of patience and closed their gap to the others. At 1302 the animals then finally took the sea lion into the depths, over one hour after the encounter had begun, and the crew determined that they had successfully drowned their prey. It was unclear how long the hunt had been going on before the whales were detected by the Mike 1 crew, but it is thought that the average sea lion hunt lasts roughly 45 minutes!
The prey sharing began with T030 surfacing with the sea lion carcass clenched in her jaw, and was rather mellow from then on. The animals were surfacing slowly and in various directions, making little way east in the current, and seemed to divide the spoils evenly as several members of the group were observed surfacing with scraps of flesh in their mouths. The animals eventually moved on, travelling east toward Race Rocks, and the crew ended the encounter at 1405 and headed east for Victoria.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-3

Since the report was an hour and a half old by the time we left Snug, we headed up mid-Haro Strait expecting J pod (who had been in San Juan Channel the previous day) whales heading south anywhere north of Mitchell Bay. When we were off Stuart Island and still not seeing anything, we began wondering if the whales went into Boundary Pass or if they were actually transients who could be a lot of places by now. 
As we neared Turn Point and were preparing to take a route home that might find us some Ts, Katie spotted a whale about a mile northwest of Turn Point at 1145. The whale surfaced cryptically along a tide line a couple/few times and then vanished. Another whale was seen briefly further to the northwest but it too was being hard to re-find. We finally saw a male to the northwest of us and headed toward him while our cryptic whale surfaced a distance behind us after an extremely long dive. The male came up off the southeast corner of Moresby Island not far from where the original report was and it was J26. J26 was traveling slowly north up Swanson Channel. We saw another male almost 3/4s of a mile to the east of J26. This ended up being J27 and he too traveled slowly up Swanson Channel. After J27, we were having a hard time finding any new whales so we went back to J26 to see if he would give us a better photo. J26 was being steady and predictable but he was not arching much. While we were with him, we saw a threesome to the east of us. By the time we got over to those whales, the third whale had moved off to the southeast a little. The pair was J31 and J56 and they were also traveling slowly up mid-Swanson Channel. The third whale was a couple of hundred yards to the southeast of the J31s and this was J42. J42 was the furthest east whale we saw and she was almost a mile off the Pender bluffs. The only other whales we could spot after J42 were on the western side of the channel. As we headed over that direction we could see J38 join up with J22. These two were traveling loosely together when J45 suddenly appeared just slightly behind them. While these three were in a loose group on our starboard side, J16 appeared for two or three surfacings about a hundred yards off our port bow. J16 soon disappeared and J22 also moved off to the northwest. J38 and J45 briefly continued to travel as a loose pair before J38 moved off to the west and they spread out again. We could not see any other whales and we figured the rest of J pod must be spread out to the north of us up Swanson Channel. It was getting dark with rain clouds to the west of us though, so we decided to end the encounter at 1338 about a mile north of Moresby Island.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-2

They set a course for Active Pass and were passing Clover Point by 1150. They picked up George off the rocks in front of his home north of Ten Mile Point, and the trio continued north for the whales. 
They were approaching Enterprise Reef at 1331 when George spotted a male killer whale travelling west from just outside of Active Pass. They watched the animal roll to his side and pec-slap, and many more began appearing. By this time, Mark had talked to Lisa Moorby on the North Pender Island shore and confirmed that she had seen over twenty animals pass her roughly an hour earlier, so they were expecting residents to be lagging behind a group of Bigg’s, confirmed as members of the T060’s along with their travelling associate T002B, that were seen from shore going east through Active Pass at ~1230. Sure enough, when they got alongside that first bull, Mark instantly recognized a rapidly sprouting J39. Always on the small side for his age, it seems that in his 18th year J39 is finally growing into his years. J38 was seen closer to the Galliano shoreline chasing a salmon and appeared successful in his efforts as several gulls followed behind him to pick up a few remaining scraps.
Over the next hour, Mark, Joe and George were able to confirm all of J pod but J19, though she was likely present in the large spread. The animals were trending northwest against an ebb current, foraging as they made their way up Trincomali Channel. J31 and J56 were foraging close together, near J27 and the surviving J14s. Successful predations by both J31 and J40 were observed, as both females carried their salmonid prey to the surface for a few breaths before scarfing it down.
Departing the foraging aggregation, the Mike 1 crew moved north in the channel to pick off a few solo individuals and two trios of northbound whales, including young J57 and J58. They left those J17s and J19s and moved north to find the apparent lead animal, J16, roughly a half-mile ahead. They ended the encounter off Wise Island at 1521 and eased south to begin the long trip home. A later shore report placed the whales reaching Porlier Pass at the north end of Galiano Island by 1650.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2022encounters/2022-1

Mark had earlier found them east bound in the kelp bed at Trial Island while guiding a whale watch trip and watched them race past the Steller sealion haul out at Seabird Point, Discovery Island. A second group had recently been observed by George Hamilton, spotting from shore at Ten Mile Point lookout, that were porpoising south in Haro Strait on an intercepting course. With the help of Gord Rowles, spotting from his 23rd floor apartment “Crow’s Nest”, Mike 1 was able to locate the group within minutes of powering up at the entrance to Victoria harbour.
Mike 1 slowed at 1614 to begin the encounter with a group of whales that were milling on an apparent sealion ~4 nm SSW of Discovery Island. Shortly, the large Steller sea lion carcass rose to the surface, amidst the whales, who took turns revelling over their prize. As Mark and Joe arrived, they had observed two groups of whales, one milling and one southwest-bound for that milling group. In hindsight, they realized that the group arriving was an additional one to what Mark had observed on the waterfront earlier in the afternoon.
The original group of whales, the initiators of the sea lion predation, were identified as the T068Cs and the T124As. Both matriarchs had young animals in tow, T068C5 being born in late 2020 and young T124A7 having been observed for the first time last week off the north end of Vancouver Island by colleague Jared Towers of DFO’s Cetacean Research Program and Bay Cetology. With her 7th confirmed calf, T124A joins an elite but growing list of Bigg’s matriarchs to have given birth to at least seven offspring. T060 was the first known to do so in mid-2019, and T109A joined her in spring 2021.
The new group welcomed from Haro Strait proved to be sisters T075B and T075C with their offspring, including a very young calf travelling alongside T075C! The animal appeared just slightly younger than T124A7, with folds still clearly visible along the trailing edge of his/her dorsal fin, and it was glued to mom’s side. This youngster has been designated T075C3, and is her second in just over two years after T075C2 was first observed in late 2019! The rest of the animals were difficult to identify in evening light with their unpredictable surfacing while feeding, but as many as 17 were present if all those presumed are accounted for after a more thorough analysis. The whales were still milling around the sea lion and active as the last light faded and Mark and Joe ended the encounter at 1639 and headed for the dock.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-96

Joe mobilized Mike 1 and met them at the dock for a late afternoon departure. They left the harbour just after 1530 and turned east, expecting to find the animals in the vicinity of Trial Island.
Slowing as they approached Harling Point on the Victoria waterfront, Mark spotted the whales inshore of the research boat. The encounter began at 1542 with a pair of westbound killer whales, T049A2 and T097. Both individuals were seen last week, just before Christmas, though T049A2 was then travelling with his uncle, T049C (see Encounter #91) and T097 was solo, two days behind them (see Encounter #93). The two bulls were making good speed in a strong ebb current and had reached Clover Point in only two breath cycles. Just west of Clover Point, the duo nabbed a presumed harbour seal and commenced prey sharing. As is often the case with solo animals, the two made quick work of their prey, though they did spend some time enjoying the spoils. After watching the exhibition for a little while, the crew ended the encounter just off Brotchie Ledge and entered the harbour at 1630.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-95

They shortly came upon a few scattered killer whales to the northwest of VH buoy just outside the harbour and began the encounter at 1115. The morning info placed the whales just meters off the beach along the Victoria waterfront, and after initially spotting only a single bull, they were thinking “Bigg’s.” Several more suddenly appeared, and with the large spread and erratic swimming patterns, they realized that they had stumbled into Southern Residents!
The first animal photographed was L82, but she quickly dove and was not seen again until much later in the encounter. The first few whales that the crew were finally able to lock on to were recognized as L72 and L105! L pod had not been sighted in the Salish Sea since early November when Dave encountered them in San Juan Channel (see Encounter #86). The other whales in the area were well spread and multi-directional in travel, making identification difficult. The group as a whole would disappear for several minutes at a time, presumably diving quite deep for winter chinook, which tends to be much nearer the bottom than their spring/summer counterparts in this area.
After around 45 minutes of trying to identify several juveniles and females with little success, the animals all suddenly aimed into the Royal Roads anchorages, where a small group was starting to form. L86s and L87 were joined by L91 and her youngster, L122, and they turned south with some L55s. Another group - L105, L72, and others - had formed just over a mile to the south, and only L82 remained on the periphery, well inshore of the rest, though every whale was now southwest bound toward William Head or Race Pass.
The two large groups travelled south for several breathing cycles until the northern one that Mike 1 was with briefly broke up to forage as they approached William Head. Several apparently unsuccessful lunges from L82 and L83 were observed, but shortly she and the other scattered whales reformed a tight group raced southeast to rejoin the once distant group that they had now overtaken. The two groups met at 1330 and swam steadily south toward Port Angeles, not giving away their afternoon plan. Mike 1 ended the encounter northeast of Race Rocks at 1347 and headed for the warmth of home, having confirmed each of the 19 killer whales making up this sub-group of L pod, including the youngest Southern Resident, L125, and the eldest male, L87.
Of note, Mark received a video from the early morning shore sighting when Mike 1 was inbound for the harbour, and it seemed to confirm that a second group of whales had been present, likely Bigg’s.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-94

Just prior, the trio on Mike 1 had paused to document a pair of humpbacks travelling a reciprocal course to the bulls, and as both species dove it appeared that they were on a collision course. When the T049 pair surfaced from their dive it seemed likely that they had surfaced prematurely due to a close (underwater) pass to the humpbacks. With the whales apparently committed to continuing their circuit – the same pair was seen travelling the same path less than a week prior, on December 17th – the encounter was ended at 1528 and the guys continued into the harbour.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-91

The trio (and Fin made four) departed Victoria at 1100 and made way for Race Rocks. After observing one of the largest elephant seals any of them had seen, and sharing each others pinniped facts, they continued on to the Juan de Fuca in search of more. An exhaustive search to Sheringham Point and back yielded just a pair of humpbacks and the three were ready to pack it in and head for Victoria when Mark received a call from George Hamilton with perhaps the find of the year.
George was at home in Victoria checking out a few sea lions on the Race Rocks Ecological Reserve webcam when he noticed a weather clearing off to the south of the park and decided to adjust the camera angle. He quickly spotted what he thought was a killer whale well south of the park, and called the guys on Mike 1. About seven minutes later they finally spotted what George had, and slowed to find a lone killer whale roughly 3.5 miles south of the webcam position at Race Rocks! Incredible. They began the encounter at 1403 just northwest of the VF buoy with a solitary T251, as the crew got one beautiful breathing cycle from him before a long dive and direction change. The animal was possibly travelling solo, as none of his immediate kin were spotted. The Mike 1 crew departed his vicinity as he zig-zagged west and spent 15-20 minutes searching for the rest of the gang, to no avail. When observed in the Juan de Fuca in October, T251 was observed several times travelling over two nautical miles from the remainder of his matriline (T252, T253 and T253A), so it cannot be ruled out that they were also in the area. They ended the encounter just west of where they began, at 1522, and headed for home.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-90

Dave talked to Mark Malleson on the radio and learned that the whales were the T167s, a group that he wanted to see. Dave departed Snug Harbor at 1125 and transited Mosquito Pass to the northwest entrance to Roche Harbor, only to find that the T167s had pulled a vanishing act for a series of surfacings. After waiting longer than even lengthy-long dives usually last, he decided that the whales must have given everyone the slip, as Transients often do.
Turn Point was considered a good potential option to re-find the whales, so Dave turned northwest toward Stuart Island. After maybe ten minutes of heading in that direction, he saw a large splash offshore of Tiptop Hill on Stuart Island. Shortly after, he spotted fins where the splash had been, and the encounter began at 1205. The whales were in a tight group heading north about three-quarters of a mile south of Tiptop Hill, at which point they submerged again before “Orcinus” was anywhere near them. When they came up after a dive lasting four and half minutes, they were closer to shore and still in a tight group moving up the Stuart Island shoreline. Dave got just close enough to get a few ID shots before the whales went on another long dive. After another four and a half minute dive, the whales came up about a hundred yards ahead of the boat and Dave took a few right side photos of the group before they took their next long dive. When the whales surfaced again, they were far up ahead and past Turn Point, and it was obvious that better ID shots would be hard to come by in the open water of Boundary Pass. Dave ended the encounter there at 1225, a little north of Tiptop Hill on Stuart Island. That was twenty minutes well spent with a group of Bigg’s Transient whales that we do not see that often, and it was merely a nanosecond in their lifetime.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-89

They were joined by Brendon at the boat and departed Victoria at 0915.
The three stopped to document the presence of two humpback whales just southwest of Race Rocks before continuing west along the traffic lanes of the Juan de Fuca. As they were coming up to speed, Mark spotted a distant splash on the horizon before he and Joe spotted the unmistakable profile of a male killer whale dorsal fin. Several more fins appeared and the crew slowed to begin the encounter at 1023 at 48° 15.80 ’ N / 123° 38.20 ’ W, south of Beechey Head.
The whales were spread across at least a mile north-south, and apparently travelling east. Southern Residents were shortly confirmed with photos of the J14s travelling loosely together. J35 was travelling alone to the north of the group, but her yearling J57 was found just a few hundred meters southeast of her, travelling exuberantly with J51 and company. J41 was travelling just east of them with her mother, J19. Over the next hour, all members of J pod were identified but J44, who was likely present but eluded detection in the 2.0 nautical mile spread of long-diving residents.
As they were waiting for an opportunity to photo-ID J26 and end the encounter, Joe spotted several more killer whales approximately 1.5 nm northwest of their location. As the spread of Js was to the southeast, and he was seeing at least two additional bulls, the crew assumed new whales. Sure enough, after confirming J26, Mike1 shifted roughly 1.0 nm north-northwest to find several members of K pod shadowing the Js past Whirl Bay. These whales were also well spread, but the guys were able to pick out many of the K13s and some K14s, who were shortly followed by K26 and K36. Neither K16 nor K35 were spotted, and it is possible that they were present in the large spread or travelling apart from the rest of K pod for the moment. The encounter ended at 1315 at 48° 15.65 ’ N / 123° 30.45 ’ W as the whales continued east, south of Rosedale Rock, only occasionally pausing to forage as they approached Race Rocks.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-88

Katie could not go so Dave and Kelley headed down to the boat and left Snug Harbor a little after 1100. We headed north and hoped to catch the whales up near Stuart Island. On the way there, we talked to Mark Malleson who said he found the whales in Boundary Pass while looking for a different report of probable transients. He saw the whales were residents and moved on to find something else.

We saw our first whales around 1150 halfway between Gooch Island and Tiptop Hill on Stuart Island. The encounter began at 1155 with J27 traveling down mid-Haro Strait by himself. The whales were very spread out. About a quarter mile to the northwest of J27 we saw J26 also traveling down Haro. J16 was about 100 yards to his east. J26 briefly turned east before continuing south again. J27 was then seen chasing a fish to the east of us. We next saw J45 by himself and then J39 also traveling by himself mid-strait off Spieden Island. We could see more spread out whales way over on the Canadian side off Halibut Island and the north end of Sydney Island. We worked our way west and saw J31 and J56 traveling together. J46 and J53 were also spread out in the same general area. We continued west and saw J38 by himself and then the J41s together in a group. West of them we found J19 and J22 foraging while loosely spread out. We also caught glimpses and took proof of presence photos of J36 and J37-both still without calves. We felt like we got most of the whales we could find on the western side of the strait and began working our way back east again toward Kellett Bluff. We saw the J41s again along with re-sighting J39 and J53 on our way back across. We found J42 off the mouth of Mitchell Bay and the last whale we saw was J27 off the south end Mitchell Bay.

A little while later, John Durban of the SR3 drone project called to say that they were with at least the K12s and some Ls spread out near Jones Island. Dave headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1425. While on the way there, John called Dave on the radio to report that they had seen L94. This meant that the L12s were present in the San Juans for the first time in 2021 since a brief evening visit in sloppy weather back in late July. The first whales were seen on the San Juan Island side of San Juan Channel south of Yellow Island and the encounter began at 1450.
The whales were very spread out in singles and small groups. J38 and J22 were the first whales photographed as they traveled southeast down San Juan Channel. About a quarter mile to the northwest of them was a single male traveling by himself. This was L85. There were lots of other whales around but they were spread from the San Juan Island shoreline to the Shaw Island shoreline. A little to the north of L85, L105 milled with J49 and another juvenile. J37 crossed the stern of the boat on her way to somewhere. L86 and L125 were also seen traveling quietly down the channel by themselves. Dave then saw a small group to the north near the Shaw Island shoreline and headed over there. This was the L22s, L91s, and J47 traveling together. J35 and J57 passed by on the other side of the boat not too far from another pair that turned out to be J46 and J53. South of these whales closer to mid-channel there were more loosely spread whales. J27 was milling in the area and L88 passed him by. L108 was also milling in the area. With the L12s and L54s here, this was the first encounter CWR had had with all of L pod present in inshore waters in over a year. About a hundred yards from where L108 had been milling, J27 began chasing his own fish. While J27 tried to catch his salmon, L85 and L87 passed by on the SJI side of the boat spread apart by sixty to seventy yards. Dave then headed back to the L22s/L91s/J47 group closer to Shaw Island to see if any new whales had showed up there. J35 had joined the group along with L94, L121, and L115 and these whales were loosely spread as they traveled slowly southeast off the Shaw Island shoreline towards Hicks Bay. A few hundred yards to their southwest, L88 traveled loosely with a rambunctious group of juvenile males that included J44, L117, and L123. L108 was also nearby. L88 moved about seventy yards to the south of the group and was joined by L54. Dave stopped a little south of Hicks Bay as the trailing whales trickled by. The L86s and J45 were near the Shaw Island in a tight group while the spread out J16s followed to the southwest of them. J36 still did not have a calf with her. The L82s were behind the J16s and J27 was the last whale to pass the boat. The encounter ended there at 1617 about halfway between Turn Island and Hicks Bay on Shaw Island. The whales eventually headed down SJ Channel towards Cattle Point. The SR3 team had reported seeing the K12s at the beginning of their encounter with the lead whales.

One report suggested eastbound whales with open saddle patches, while the other just stated “many whales” westbound. Both suggested Southern Residents, so they met at Mike 1 and departed Victoria just before 1600 to see what they could find.
At 1615 they began seeing a large spread of killer whales travelling west across the traffic lanes to the south of Victoria, apparently headed for Race Rocks. They began the encounter at 1622 at 48 ° 19.56 ’ N / 123 ° 27.76 ’ W with several members of the J16 matriline. Siblings J26 and J36 were among the first whales photographed, confirming that at least those members of J pod most recently observed travelling down Boundary Pass into Haro Strait (see Encounter #84) were likely present. The J22s and J37s were nearby, associating with several other animals. Those extras proved to be the bulk of the L47 and L55 matrilines! On queue, K35 burst out of the deep on the other side of Mike 1 and her crew realized they were viewing a majority of the clan, together in the inside waters for the first time since mid-September. K16 surfaced alongside J19, the remaining K13s and K14, and near the L72s, L87 and J47. After confirming the whales present in this loose concentration, the Mike 1 crew made their way southwest toward a number of animals that were now west of Rosedale Rock, to the southwest of Race Rocks.
These animals proved to be the missing K pod whales, the K12s. They were also westbound, but stalled as Mike1 passed them, before angling north to meet the bulk of the whales now transiting through the Race Rocks Marine Protected Area. After documenting K26, the westernmost animal they observed, Mark and Joe dropped back to just west of Race Rocks and waited for the animals to clear the park bounds. They watched as roughly 30 whales circled and socialized off West Race Rocks before lining up and diving facing west. When they resurfaced, the whales were arranged in their respective pods; the 20 Ls - including the youngest Southern Resident, L125 - were leading the 24 Js by roughly 400 metres. The K12s had vanished, and presumably joined the large aggregation roughly one nautical mile to the west-southwest.
Mark and Joe captured a sequence of left-side ID photos of each of the two eastern groups, as they had to this point only been working through spread animals and documented perhaps half of the whales present, before ending the encounter off Christopher Point at 1806 at 48° 18.07 ’ N / 123° 33.84 ’ W, with all of the animals heading west. No members of the L12 or L54 matrilines were observed, nor were any of their constant companions, the L22s, L25 and L88. Mark and Joe concluded that all members of J and K pods were present, along with the twenty members of L pod more commonly found in the inside waters in recent years, for a total of 60 whales!",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-85

We headed up Haro Strait toward Turn Point and were expecting to meet the whales somewhere near Stuart Island. After rounding Turn Point and not seeing anything, we began heading in the direction of Skipjack Island.

Around 1605, whales were spotted and the encounter began at 1610 about midway between Johns Pass and Blunden Island. The whales were spread out in groups and singles and were all heading down Boundary Pass toward Turn Point. The first group we saw included J31, J56, J37, J40, J46, and J57. J35 was about a hundred and fifty yards ahead of the group and J45 and J47 were traveling together about a hundred yards behind them. J56 and J57 were very active and playing with each other and with J46. J57 did numerous half breaches as he and J56 gambled along. J45 and J47 caught up to the group although they remained slightly peripheral to it. A few hundred yards behind the first group was another group that included J41, J58, J42, J49, and J53. J22 also showed up and joined and J37 dropped back from the first group to join this one too. J38 could be seen a good third of a mile to the southeast and another male was another half mile or more to the east of him. Once we were done with this second group, we moved over to get a better proof of presence shot on J38 and hopefully spot some whales to the east of us. We were getting shots of J38 when we noticed that the group with his mom in it had stalled out and were now milling nearby. J38 joined the group and they all lined up briefly before a couple members spread back out a little. While we were taking left sides of this line up, we finally saw a few other whales to the northwest of us.

We moved about a third of a mile to the northwest to a pair that turned out to be J44 and J51 traveling together. Another third of a mile to the west of them was J39 traveling southwest by himself. We were still hoping to find J36 to see if she had had her calf but we couldn’t find any whales on the horizon we hadn’t been on yet. After a little looking we saw a male a half mile east of Turn Point near the Stuart Island shoreline. This was J27 and he followed the groups ahead of him around Turn Point and into Haro Strait. We were not seeing any other whales in Boundary Pass so we decided to head down Haro toward home and see if any whales we were looking for had joined the leaders. We re-found the leaders about a half mile south of Turn Point. The whales had moved offshore a bit into some tidal slop. The whales were loosely spread out and heading south. We did see J19 who we hadn’t seen yet and she spyhopped to look at us. Since we did not know where to go to find J36, it was getting dark, and the clouds were threatening rain, we ended the encounter there at 1735.

There was a chance of seeing them from CWR so Dave flew out the door as quickly as possible. Dave arrived at CWR around 1130 just in time to take a few photos from the deck of the lone minke whale porpoising north past the reef. There were no longer any killer whales chasing it but it was getting the hell out of Dodge anyway. A small group of transients showed up at least a mile offshore heading slowly northeast toward Kellett Bluff. Dave took a few dot shots from the porch and, after looking at some photos on the back of the camera, realized that the male looked like T2C1. Since Dave hadn’t seen the T2Cs in a couple of years, and the rain was rather light, he decided to see if he could get some ID photos of them. He then headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat around 1210.

The encounter started at 1220 about a half mile southwest of Henry Island. The T2Cs were in a tight group and were moving slowly north. There were only four whales as T2C4 was not present. The whales turned northwest toward Halibut Island before going on a long dive. When the whales came up again, they were well on the Canadian side of Haro Strait and were now heading south. For the next half hour, the T2Cs zig-zagged on their long dives back and forth across the strait. Since the whales didn’t seem to want to be bothered, and it was starting to rain harder, Dave ended the encounter at 1305 about three quarters of a mile north of Kelp Reef without ever getting a proper photo ID pass out of them.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-83

Dave decided to give it a try and headed to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 0955. Off the north end of Henry Island, Dave caught a glimpse of a few fast-moving whales heading north about a third of a mile to his west. The encounter began at 1007.

The three whales turned out to be T60, T60F, and T60G and they turned almost due east towards Spieden Channel and began porpoising. Dave followed along and got a few shots of the trio as they sped towards the channel. Jane had said they had seen a male so Dave figured that T60C and maybe T2B, who often travels with the T60s, would be around somewhere. Around 1015, the trio slowed down about a quarter mile north of Battleship Island. About this time, two more whales, a male and a female, showed up about a half mile north of the others. This was indeed T60C and T2B and they were slowly snooping around the north edge of Danger Shoal. When they were done milling, T2B and T60C headed slowly south towards the other three whales who seemed to be waiting for them. T2B and T60C joined the others around 1030. All five whales turned southeast towards Battleship Island and began traveling slowly that direction in a loose group. The whales went on a long dive and came up milling in the kelp inside of McCracken Point near the north tip of Henry Island. The whales then went through the gap between the point and Battleship and stayed near the shoreline at the north tip of McCracken Point. The whales were pointed east into Spieden Channel. After another long dive, the whales split again with T60, T60F, and T60G surfacing near the northwest entrance to Roche Harbor while T2B and T60C came up just a little east of Barren Island. All five whales rejoined off the northeast entrance to Roche Harbor. The whales then began milling like they were on a kill near shore just inside the point north of the northeast entrance to Roche. After they finished with the kill they headed around the point and headed east on the San Juan Island shoreline. About midway between the previous point and Limestone Point, the whales began milling again like they were on another kill. T60F and T60G stayed behind for a few minutes to feed after the other three moved on before hurrying to catch up.

Dave then called Katie and they met at Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1025. We were off Tiptop Hill on Stuart Island when we saw our first whales and the encounter began at 1049.

The whales were spread out across Haro Strait in singles and small groups and all were heading south. The first group we approached appeared to have several small juveniles all rolling around and socializing with one another. When we got there, it was only J53 and J56 playing together. Another group appeared a few hundred yards to the east of them and were moving south more quickly. This was all three of the J35s plus J58 who was traveling with them. There were others whales spread out in singles and pairs to the south and west of the J35s group. A distant pair to the west turned out to be J44 and J49 traveling together and another pair to the south was J40 and J46. The J16s minus J36 were also spread out to the north of the J35s group. J27 was traveling alone to the west of the J16s. Ahead of him, J56 had rejoined J31. J45 was also in the area and the J22s were spread out another half mile to the west well on the Canadian side of the strait. Several whales seemed to have moved across to the other side of the strait and there were groups forming closer to Kellett Bluff. We headed that direction and got on the J16s minus J36 again off north Kellett Bluff. This time they were in a tighter group. There were a couple of other groups up ahead of them but they were already tight against the bluff and were heading south quickly.

We decided to head to Roche Harbor to top the boat off with fuel and then head back out after the whales had passed down the west side to the False Bay area. We left the whales off Kellett Bluff at 1145 and headed to the Roche Harbor fuel dock. After topping off the boat, we headed back out through Mosquito Pass and found that the whales were still spread out across Andrews Bay. We continued the encounter around 1240 off of Smugglers Cove. The whales didn’t make it very far in the hour we were gone and the first whales we saw were J16 and J26 again-this time spread out. J45 was inshore of the J16s just north of CWR. We headed south and found J38 off the County Park and then J19 off Bellevue Point. The whales stalled out about a quarter mile north of Lime Kiln State Park. For the next half hour there seemed to be a lot of foraging going on between the old lime kiln and the County Park as we sat about three quarters of a mile northwest of Lime Kiln. A few spread out whales passed us heading south but they didn’t head south of Lime Kiln yet. One of these was pregnant J36 who was at the top of the list of whales we wanted to see in case she had had her calf. She did not have a calf yet but we are hopeful we will see her with it sometime this Fall. A few of the whales that had passed us to the south milled their way back north of us again as they foraged. J53 chased and caught a salmon near us. Around 1345, the whales finally committed to heading south and began making their way down the west side. The whales were still spread out but all seemed to be within about a mile of San Juan Island. J38 was milling north of us when we heard a louder blow and saw a humpback heading north past him. J38 breached twice as he passed us heading south. We ended the encounter with J pod at 1410 just a little south of Lime Kiln and went to see if the humpback would fluke for us. The humpback turned into a pair of them but they were being kinda cryptic while we were still a ways behind them. We stayed behind the mother and large calf pair for several series of surfacings but the neither of the two whales fluked for us. We then moved up and got a few photos of their left side dorsal fins. We left the pair at 1430 still traveling slowly north-northwest about a mile west of the County Park.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-81

It was raining at the time but the whales looked like they would be on the west side for the day so we delayed our departure. Dave had time to see Michael and Flora off at the airport and, shortly after lunch, he and Katie met at Snug Harbor and left in the boat at about 1345.
We saw our first whales off the north end of False Bay and our encounter started there at 1412. The whales were very spread out in singles and small groups. First was an active group of three that ended up being J45, J47, and J49 playing together. Southeast of them near the south end of False Bay we found the J31s and the other J35s. J35 was with both the juveniles while J31 traveled slowly by herself sometimes as much as a hundred yards to the southeast of others. J35 also moved inshore a ways but both J56 and J57 were zipping around and socializing with each other. Southeast of them closer to Eagle Point we found J39 heading east down island by himself before he turned offshore. We then found J19 foraging by herself a little east of J39 but we didn’t see anyone down island from her so we headed offshore a bit to where we had seen distant whales earlier. There was a breeze coming out of the south and it was sloppier offshore but we had a little group forming. We saw J42 and another whale that was probably J16. This whale moved off to the southeast before we could photograph her but J42 started logging at the surface. A third whale who may have been J40 passed us on the other side of the boat. Another small group was approaching J42 from the northwest and this was the J41s. The J41s joined J42 and the group made a direction change and began heading north towards Pile Point. J37 also appeared and she and J41 traveled a little ahead of J51, J58, and J42. This was a rowdy threesome and there was a lot of tactile social behavior with the whales occasionally charging around. J42 did a couple of cartwheels and one nice breach. J58 was also doing a lot of splashing around, practicing her tail lobs, and playing with kelp. After getting pictures of this group, we moved offshore and west to get pictures of a loosely spread female and adult male. This was J16 and J26 and they were also traveling north toward San Juan Island. While getting photos of this pair, we noticed more whales appearing back inshore so we headed back that direction after we were done with them. J19 and J39 had joined the J41s, J37, and J42 group and all were heading north off Pile Point. J36 was inshore and ahead of this group. J36 was reported to be the most heavily pregnant of the three pregnant J pod whales but she didn’t have a new calf with her today. More whales appeared ahead and inshore of theses whales. A group of three rolling around together turned out to be J27, J45, and J47. Other whales, including the few whales we had not photographed yet like J40, J44, J46, and J53, were here. J22 and J38 joined the group from the southeast. Soon after, J16 and J26 arrived from a little offshore and also joined the rest of the pod. All of J pod then traveled up island in a single slightly loose group. We ended the encounter at 1540 just south of Hannah Heights as the rain began to fall again.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-80

At 10:47, Dave, Michael, and Charli left Snug Harbor to go see which whales were around.

The team arrived on scene at 11:16 south of Blunden with the T65Bs, T36s, along with T65A5. They had apparently just finished a kill, and were milling in a tight group and being quite social, with lots of surface active behaviors. At least one whale had parts of a prey item in its mouth, although its not clear from our photographs whether this is a seal or a porpoise. The whales started slowly trending northeast. They briefly split into two groups, with the T65Bs somewhat behind the rest of the whales.

The whales continued to trend northeast towards the Gulf Islands. After a few good passes, the team decided to call the encounter at 11:38 and headed back to the dock at Snug.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-79

She had spotted a small group of killer whales with a new calf slightly offshore of Ten Mile Point headed south for Discovery Island.

Mark felt it was likely the T099's as they had been spotted a few days before in Saanich Inlet, and a new calf belonging to T099 was reported.
He made his way to town and mobilized Mike 1. He picked up his long-time friend Duncan McCallum and his friend Meg Whyte at the Coast Hotel dock on his way out of the harbour. Duncan had introduced Mark to whale watching in the mid-1990s when Mark joined Duncan on the tracker boat out of the Oak Bay Beach Hotel to search for the Southern Resident killer whales one foggy morning. Mark will never forget that day when they found most of the Clan mid-Haro Strait heading to San Juan Island on a line from Discovery Island.
The whale watch fleet had received the report of what did turn out to be the T099's so the Mike 1 crew wanted to make the encounter as brief as possible with the intention to get some pictures of the newest addition to the pod without interfering with not only the T099 family's movements but also the viewing of the passengers on the two commercial boats on scene. Mike 1 arrived at 1254 ~ 3 nm southeast of Discovery and could see the group were traveling SW.
They ended the encounter at 1406 once they got a few decent shots of the new calf. It took just over an hour to do this as it was often tucked on the opposite side of its mom. The group seemed to be very attentive to their new family member as they stayed in a tight group for the duration of the encounter and appeared to continue their southwest heading.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-78

Early in the morning, Charli heard faint calls on the Lime Kiln hydrophone, and shore reports suggested that a fairly large, spread group of whales was heading for the south side of the island. Dave, Michael, and Charli left the dock at 9:17 to investigate and determine which whales were still in the area, and to check on whether any of the known pregnant whales had delivered their calves.

The team sighted their first whale a half mile southwest of Eagle Point at 9:53. The team first found J35 with her young calf J57, moving offshore with some speed. Next, they came across J42, travelling without any close associates.

The team found a group of whales foraging, which turned out to be the J41s. After J41 captured a fish, the team observed lots of prey sharing and socializing, including J58 with a bit of salmon guts hanging out of her mouth.

The team spotted a large adult male off in the distance. When they got closer, they identified this whale as J26, actively foraging on his own. After a few surfacings with him, they moved to another male further inshore. This male was J27, also actively foraging. As they photographed J27, the team spotted several whales spread out around False Bay, further in shore.

As they moved inshore and up island, the team identified several more members of J pod, including J31 travelling with J56, J39, young males J47 and J49 socializing, and J37. The team was now fairly confident that only J pod whales were present in this group. As they slowly inched north to start heading home, they also found J19, foraging nearby J35 and J37.

Mark received a call a few minutes later from her saying, ""I have them!"" as she spotted a few dorsal fins near McNeil Bay headed for Trial Island while driving along the waterfront.
Mark headed downtown to mobilize Mike 1, leaving Victoria harbour at 0835. He made his way east towards Oak Bay, and as he went through Enterprise Channel between the golf course and Trial Island, he spotted distant blows at the edge of the sun glare a couple of miles south of the Oak Bay Flats.
He started the encounter at 0855 as he slowly approached the group and soon confirmed T018, T019, T019C, and the young sprouting male, T060E. Mark scanned around to look for others and soon spotted the unmistakable boomerang-like fin of T019C's older brother, T09B. He was within a mile to the southwest traveling with T060E's partner in crime and older brother, T060D. The T060 brothers were part of the group of 17 individuals from the evening before and apparently had found some new buddies to hang out with.
T019B and the younger male T060D stayed tight together on the north edge of the group as T018 split off from her daughter T019 to the south of the group. T019C and the youngest male of the team, T060E, trailed slightly behind.
Mark ended the encounter at 0949 ~ 3 nm south of Discovery Island when it was apparent there were no other individuals around, and the first commercial whale watch boat out of Victoria arrived.
Mark heard later that the T060 brothers had later split off from the group and came into Oak Bay via Baynes Channel. The T065B's joined up with the T018's and Ken had a brief encounter with them on his transit to San Juan Island from Port Angeles.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-76

He hustled downtown to mobilize Mike 1 and departed Victoria harbour at ~1715.
As he entered Race Pass, he could see Brett Soberg on Forever Wild heading north for Victoria after recently departing the group. Brett had informed him that there were close to 20 individuals, and they appeared to be milling in two groups separated by less than a half-mile, and his crew was fairly confident that the T069's and the T137's were present along with some others that they hadn't had a chance to confirm.
Mark soon spotted a bull on the horizon, and as he slowly approached the area could see several more appear in the vicinity. He started the encounter at 1749 ~ 4 nm SW of Race Rocks and soon confirmed that the T069's, T137's, T060D, T060E, as well as all of the T046B's and B1's were present in two mixed groups.
Brett had initially spotted the bulk of them heading east in the Juan de Fuca, and others had joined them from the south. When Mark arrived, they were socializing, and it seemed apparent they had recently met up as their vocals could be heard resonating through the aluminum hull of Mike 1 as the group intermingled with each other.
Once Mark felt he had got proof of the presence of all 17 individuals present, he ended the encounter at 1850 and made his way for home as daylight was fading quickly. He drove home against the southeast swell making no more than 16 knots until the seas flattened out a few miles south of the entrance to Victoria harbour.

The team met at Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 0920. Charli had seen a group of five or so whales head north past the Center earlier.

We putted out into Mitchell Bay and immediately saw whales and the encounter started at 0925. The whales were very spread out and we saw one whale that was right off Smugglers Cove and another that looked like it was Canadian side of the Strait. There was a male about midway between the two and we went to him first. This was L87 and he was traveling north-northeast toward Open Bay. North of him we found J22 and K36 spread out and foraging off Kellett Bluff. We then headed to the northwest toward a group north of Halibut Island and saw J38 actively foraging by himself along the way. The group ended up being the K14s (minus K36) and the K16s. They were in a tight group and were pointed northeast when they went on their long dive. L91 and L122 were a couple hundred yards to the southwest of this group and went on their long dive soon after the K3s did. After a nine minute long dive, the K3s and the L91s all surfaced together about a half mile to the east-northeast of us heading slowly south in a tight group just a little north of Kellett Bluff. There were other whales spread out from the south end of Kellett Bluff to the other side of the strait still coming north. The L91s moved a little ahead of the K3s as they surfaced slowly pointing south. They all gave us a nice left side arch on their long dive and we moved to a new group rolling around about quarter mile to the north of us. This turned out to be most of the L55s-a group we were looking for to get better pictures of. We had L55, L109, L118, L103, and L123 and they were socializing and being tactile as they slowly headed south. They also gave us some nice lefts before their long dive. The L91s were a couple hundred yards to the west of the L55s. The L55s came up from their long dive still socializing but were now rolling in a more northerly direction. The K3s had moved several hundred yards offshore of the L55s with the L91s between them and all three groups were pointed slowly north. After a little while, L118 disappeared from the L55s and K42 joined them.

After getting some good right side shots on the L55s, we moved to a large group that was charging north about a half mile behind them. L118 had moved back to this group that also included J19, the J37s, L72s, L83s, L90, L82, L123, and L125. The J22s were also nearby. There was a lot of socializing going on in this group too. L123 and L125 were charging around and playing in amidst the other whales. Several of the other whales were occasionally rolling around or splashing too. L82 did a big spyhop next to the boat. A little after 1100, we left this group and moved a good three quarters of a mile north towards Tiptop Hill on Stuart Island and a whale we thought we hadn’t seen yet. This turned out to be K34 traveling by himself and he gave us a nice right side shot before his long dive. There were a few other spread out whales around in and one was K20. She also gave us a nice right side. About a hundred yards to the southwest of K20 was K38. One of the other single whales in the area was L115 traveling by himself. This was our third encounter in a row where we have photographed all the L47s except for L47 herself. We had heard that a DFO team had not been able to find her from their field work out in the western Strait of Juan de Fuca earlier in the Summer. Unfortunately, it is indeed looking like L47 is missing. K38 soon joined L115 and the two began traveling together. Most of the K3s were about three quarters of a mile offshore of this pair.

The large group that we had seen earlier, with a few additions like the rest of the J19s, J40, K27, and L106, was now porpoising north and catching up to the K3s. A loose group of whales coming up rowdily behind us in a tide rip was the L55s again-this time with L82 and L116. J35 and J57 surfaced in the middle of the L55s unexpectedly and vanished just as quickly. Some of the K12s were a couple hundred yards to the west of the L55s. Almost all the whales made their way over to the Stuart Island shoreline and headed northwest along it toward Turn Point. The K16s had stayed a little offshore and K35 chased a fish about a quarter mile northwest of Turn Point as the other whales were approaching it. The whale spread out in groups as they passed Turn Point but there was still a lot of milling and socializing going on. The Ks and Ls continued moving slowly north spread out in groups while the J pod whales quietly disappeared from the groups we were watching. We ended the encounter at 1236 about a mile north of Turn Point with the Ks and Ls heading north toward the Pender Bluffs. The whales back near Turn Point, who were mostly J pod whales, were milling and looking like they wanted to go back south. We headed home east into Boundary Pass and through Johns Pass before getting back to Snug Harbor around 1315. Dave got off the boat while Michael and Charli went back out to get some drone footage of J pod. They got some good stuff as J pod headed south along Henry Island and Andrews Bay during the afternoon.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-74

The seas were flat calm with a partly cloudy sunrise making it near perfect spotting conditions. After a long scan with binoculars to the north, south and east he made his way back to the west towards Swiftsure Bank.
The rain started as he was slightly west of the Port of San Juan and the visibility was reduced to 2 nm at best. When he got within 6 nm of the Bank a few humpback whales started to appear as expected. He was approaching the area that he had seen killer whales five out of the last eight days so he stopped for another scan and a listen with the hydrophone. With no sounds and only the occasional humpback seen within his limited visibility he continued south west along the drop off. More and more humpbacks started to appear along with increased bird life and sea lions. Then some small blows slightly to the east of his track line caught his eye. Mark stopped and climbed up on the front of the Mike 1 console to see above the low swell. Sure enough! It was what he was looking for. Killer whales. He could see a tight group of females and juveniles south west bound and was able to quickly confirm members of the L12's; L77 with her two offspring, L119 and L124 and L77's sister, L94 with her two offspring, L113 and L121.
After scanning around in the mist for the rest of the group, L89 appeared charging along up swell a couple hundred metres behind the gang and soon overtook them.
It became clear that the rest were slightly ahead as they too eventually appeared. L22, L85 and L25 were travelling in a trio, L88 was on his own, and L54 had her two offspring in tow.
An hour after spotting them Mark watched them turn around and head back to the north east to where he originally expected to find them, obviously their favourite fishing hole for the time being. He shadowed them from a distance for most of the encounter with hopes to collect some prey samples. He was not convinced they were targeting chinook salmon from his observations over the last week. With no signs of any scraps to be collected he decided to leave them be and end the encounter at 1138. He collected fluke ID's for the next hour and a half of the large aggregation of humpback whales in the area which he estimated to be 40 to 50 animals within a square mile.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-73

He took advantage of the morning light and calm seas and headed east towards Sombrio Point and stopped to scan with the hydrophone over the side a couple of miles southwest of Sombrio Point. With nothing heard or seen, he decided to head to the hot spot of the past week, 5 nm southwest of Carmanah Point.
As he got within a few miles from his destination, numerous humpback blows were seen on the horizon, and the birdlife greatly increased.
Mark slowed down as he approached the easternmost humpbacks along with numerous steller sea lions surfing in the swell. At 0844, a small blow caught his attention which put him on high alert, but within a minute, a low profile humpback appeared. His disappointment was short-lived when seconds later, a bull dorsal fin appeared slightly west of the humpback surfing down the swell, and then several more appeared. It was a decent-sized group of killer whales with what looked like at least four bulls along with ~ several more females and juveniles. Secretly Mark hoped that it wasn't the L12 and L54 matrilines that hadn't joined the rest of J clan on their foray into the inside waters of the Salish Sea on September 9th but was happy nonetheless to immediately confirm that it was them and they were still around. He hadn't seen them since September 9th, and that wasn't for lack of effort!
They were moving quickly east, all grouped up, but within a few minutes started to spread out and milled about before swinging back westward.
For the next five hours, they worked their way east, west, south, and north. At one point, he watched what looked like prey sharing, so he moved slowly in behind them with hopes of collecting a fish scale, but nothing was to be seen.
At 1130 he opportunistically photographed the tail flukes of the numerous humpback that were in the area, with some aggregations of close to 10 individuals while keeping an eye out on the behaviour and movement of the L's in the distance.
At 1334 Mark ended the encounter and could see that they didn't have a direction in mind as he wrote in the logbook that they were southwest bound and before he put the book away, they were northbound.

Since the whales were acting like they were going to stick around for the day, the team let the morning drippy-ness clear off before meeting at Snug Harbor. We left in the boat at 1204 and got on scene about a half mile southwest of Lime Kiln. The encounter began there at 1221.
The whales were very spread out from Edwards Point to south of Eagle Point and were all generally heading down island. We saw J27 and one or two others spread out foraging inshore off Edwards Point. Offshore of them, we found L83 traveling south by herself. Near Pile Point, we found K33 while J45 was inshore of him and closer to the rocks. J31 and J56 passed us on the sunny side of the boat and offshore of those two we found J44 and L110 traveling together off False Bay. L83 joined them briefly before moving off and traveling by herself again about a hundred yards ahead of them. We then moved inshore towards Eagle Point where we had seen some whales, getting a few photos of J45 traveling by himself along the way. The whales foraging near Eagle Point included J16, J42, J51, and L105 and they were spread out and coming up irregularly as they searched for fish. L105 then started traveling quickly east past American Camp when he stopped short and began milling like he found a salmon. Offshore of him we found the J41s and J46 loosely spread out and actively foraging. J53, J35, and J57 were also in the general area. Offshore of South Beach we found L90 and K34 also actively chasing fish. L90 was in the middle of chasing her fish when K34 came over to help briefly. L90 was still milling when K34 moved offshore a small ways and found a fish of his own. K34 was active and splashy in his fish chase and made a few contortionist moves before he apparently caught his fish and began moving southeast. To the southwest of K34, we found the J19s traveling south toward Hein Bank at a good clip in a tight group. J51 and J58 were a bit feisty and charged out a little ahead of J19 and J41 and did a double cartwheel together. The whales were still very spread out and we were having a hard time finding whales we hadn’t already seen. The whales we could see in the distance were whales we had thought we had got photos of and most of them were heading due south toward Hein Bank. We moved back north a little and briefly saw J31 and J56 again as well as J44 and L110 still traveling rambunctiously together. We briefly saw and got a nice arch out of J26 plus a passing backlit shot of J42 before going on a search around 1530 to find the whales we hadn’t been seeing.
There had been a group of transients (reported to be the T65As and T65Bs) moving up from the Eastern Bank area all day. The boats going back and forth between them and Cattle Pass had reported seeing a large tight group of southern residents somewhere south of Cattle Point heading in the direction of the transients. We were several miles southeast of the other residents who were in the north Hein Bank area when we found a group of three that turned out to be the J22s and J40. These three were non-directional and acting kind of furtively so we left them to find the larger group the boats kept talking about. The boats watching the transients had reported that the residents had suddenly shown up in amidst the socializing transients. The transients then dove and came up a distance away porpoising east. The residents stayed and milled in the same area where the incident happened. We arrived on scene not long after at 1625 in time to see the now distant transients porpoising off and the milling residents form up and start heading north. The whales in the group were the K14s and K16s (the K3s when they are together) along with the L72s, L91s, and L90. The group soon split into two with the K3s moving about 300 or so yards to the east of the five Ls. Both groups traveled slowly north toward the north Hein Bank marker where other groups of whales were forming. We got good shots of the Ls first and then the K3s as they headed toward the other whales. If there had been any sort of a physical confrontation with the transients, the residents showed no obvious fresh rake marks that we could see. Both groups eventually joined an even larger group that was milling in the area near the north end of Hein Bank. This group started heading slowly north back toward San Juan Island. The large group seemed to have all of J pod, the K13s, K14s, K16s, L47s, L72s, and L90 in it when we first saw it. However, the Ks and Ls quickly vanished out of the group and we had just J pod in a single tight group heading north at a medium speed. We ended the photo-ID portion of our encounter at 1754 a little north of Hein Bank. Michael and Charli wanted to get a drone flight over J pod so we put ourselves where we wanted to be and got set up for that. Michael got nearly a full flight’s worth of footage of the Js before we called ourselves happy with the day. We left J pod about two miles south of the flag pole at American Camp still heading north toward San Juan Island.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-71

The team initially planned to wait for the whales to approach East Point, however the whales took a sharp turn and headed down Active Pass and then Swanson Channel. The team left the dock at 14:19 to catch up with the whales as they made their way south.

The team arrived on scene with whales near Turn Point at 14:44. Initially, they found a few spread out whales, including members of J and K pod. After a brief look at K44, J35, and J57, they followed K42 and J47 for a while as they made their way south. A bit later, they were able to parallel K26 to get right side photo identification shots. The team then briefly encountered J36, before moving to a large male they had sighted offshore.

This large male turned out to be L87, a whale they had seen in previous encounters but had not gotten a chance to get clear ID shots of. The team paralleled the whale for some time, during which he did a large cartwheel followed by an impressive breach. After photographing his left and right sides, the team moved to a nearby pair of whales, K22 and K33, who were just ahead of another small group composed of the members of the J16s that the team hadn’t yet seen that day.

Behind these small groups was a large, tight group of whales, moving steadily south. The team moved into position to parallel this group and determine its composition. This group was composed of the J11s (except J39), the L47s (except L47), the L86s, the L72s, and L90, with the K16s following close behind everyone else. The team started on their left side before slowly moving to their right as the whales moved past Kellet Bluff and made their way south. The J16s were inshore of this group, right on the rocks of Henry Island. As the team moved inshore to head home, they encountered L103 and L123, who ended up being the last whales of the day. The team ended their encounter at 16:33 and made the short trip back to Snug.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-70

After departing the T007B matriline (see Encounter 69, Sequence 1), Mark and Joe had plans to meet a colleague around the canyons off the west coast of Vancouver Island and Washington, but a turn in weather forced them to change plans and head back to shelter of the Juan de Fuca. They were steering back in toward Cape Flattery about an hour later when a large clearing opened in the fog, and a solitary killer whale dorsal fin crested the swell almost two miles north of the boat. Two more appeared, and it was clear that this small group of killer whales was travelling quickly north on a heading that would take them almost precisely back to where the T007Bs had been left earlier in the day. They began the encounter at 1117 at 48 23.8‘ N / 124 57.6‘ W.
When Mike 1 finally neared the whales, T046E burst through the surface, racing to catch up to mom, who was leading the charge. Mike 1 followed the porpoising animals for a short while until Joe spotted the T007Bs just a few hundred meters ahead, milling at another predation. Both matrilines dove for a minute or two before the T046s surfaced on the spot where the others had gone down. T007B3 was then seen heading away from the scene. It initially appeared that the T046s may have stolen a meal until T007B4 surfaced in the middle of it all, sharing in the spoils. The remaining T007Bs, however, moved off to the periphery and were not seen again for almost an hour in the building seas. When they did reappear, they were sitting restfully at the surface until T007B4 rejoined, and all continued south.
Meanwhile, the T046s were enjoying a feast of their own, four of them savouring whatever mammal they had taken down. T046E breached and tail-lobbed nearly continuously a few hundred meters away from the rest, not joining the group and only occasionally met by younger brother T046F. Mark and Joe shadowed the whales from a good distance as they ate, but no prey was identified, and they were about to end the encounter when a pair of humpback whales joined the fray and began trumpeting and interacting with the group of killer whales. The interaction lasted three breathing cycles for both species but ended with the humpbacks moving on and the killer whales continuing their prolonged prey-sharing.
With fog setting back in and the wind picking up, the guys decided to end the encounter and return to Port Renfrew to gear up for the next day. The encounter ended at 1452 at 48° 26.9‘ N / 125° 00.9 ‘ W.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-69-2

Mark and Joe departed Gateway Marina in Port Renfrew just before 0830 and headed out into the fog searching for killer whales. They worked their way out toward the hotspot of the week at the west entrance to the Juan de Fuca and were slowing for a hydrophone drop and listen in 100-metre visibility when a familiar scent hit the boat…pinniped predation! Mark and Joe instantly noticed the large oil slick 20 feet off the port side. They shut down the vessel and listened for blows, which Mark quickly picked up some 200-300 metres off the port bow. They couldn’t spot the animals but idled in that direction and at 0952 saw several black dorsal fins slicing through the mist and began the encounter at 48° 23.3’ N / 124° 58.0’ W
An adult female and sub-adult male with distinctly wide bowed fins suggested that perhaps a rare group were present. Two other animals appeared, and the Mike 1 crew was able to identify the T007Bs! A nice find for the CWR crew, as these whales are more often encountered around Haida Gwaii and the north and west coasts of Vancouver Island. They were prey-sharing and spent the next 20 minutes milling in place, with only short dives to catch the scraps. Eventually, the group appeared ready to move on and began travelling south-southwest before a longer dive. Mark and Joe tried to keep pace on the dive, but after 15 minutes without resighting (or hearing) the whales, they had to accept that the whales had disappeared into the thick fog, and it was time to move on. They ended the encounter at 1038 at 48° 26.6’ N / 124° 57.9’ W and continued west-southwest in search of clear skies and more whales.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-69-1

J pod was thought to be in the Strait of Georgia and Mark Malleson had had an encounter with the L12s, L54s, and L88 off the southwestern coast of Vancouver Island (Encounter 67) that morning. Mark had K pod and the rest of the Ls the day before out there too and we were hoping this was who was coming in. When the whales got closer, Michael, Charli, and Dave met at Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1615.
We got on scene at 1640 about halfway between Hannah Heights and Discovery Island a little over the Canadian border. Most of the whales were spread out in singles and small groups heading quickly north up Haro Strait. Some whales were porpoising and, except for grabbing some quick pics as some whales flew by us, we were left in the dust. We were forced to play catch up for the first part of the encounter but we did see enough whales to confirm to us that we had K pod and the Ls that Mark had out west the day before. Some whales had made it over to the American side and were closer to San Juan Island but many were on the Canadian side of the border heading up the Kelp Reef line. As we tried to keep up with the fast traveling whales, we had K44 and L116 pass us as they were traveling together. The L86s, including L86’s newest calf L125, porpoised by us backlit by the sun. We also saw the L103s. Since we weren’t keeping up with the whales moving up the western side of Haro Strait, we moved east toward SJI in hopes of having a better angle on whales heading up the other side of the strait. We saw L109 traveling by himself up mid-Haro looking wobbly and well sprouted. To the southeast of him, we found L55, L83, and K36 all spread out and heading up island. We saw a little group south and inshore of the spread out whales ahead of them. We got on this group as they were off Bellevue Pt. and it included the K16s and the L72s. The L91s were another couple of hundred yards inshore of the two pairs. Also in the area were K38 and L115 who were traveling rambunctiously together in Andrews Bay. As the whales on the east side of the strait rounded Kellett Bluff, many of them took a westerly course and traveled quickly in the direction of Gooch Island and the other whales on the west side of the strait. Earlier we had seen splashes way in the distance to the north and we had heard that J pod had been coming down Boundary Pass from East Point. We wondered if the whales on the far side of the strait were already meeting J pod whales so we headed over there to find out. There were several groups of whales milling and socializing in the Gooch Island area. We quickly identified some J pod whales mixed in with the Ks and Ls. The whales were behaving in a Superpod manner with tight groups of socializing whales spending lots of time at the surface. Several whales vocalized in the air. The whales continued socializing for the next hour that we were with them, mostly in the area just a little southwest of Gooch Island although there were a few small groups and individuals spread out to the eastern side of the strait. Some of the groups looked like they may have been heading south but there was still a lot of milling going on. We ended the encounter at 1919 mid-Haro Strait about halfway between Gooch and Spieden Islands with K37 and J47 traveling together as they followed J19 slowly south.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-68

They steered directly to where the large groups of Ks and Ls had been found Monday (see Encounter #65) and Wednesday (see Encounter #66) mornings. They slowed in a nice clear patch just a few miles southwest of Carmanah Point and spotted a large group of humpbacks just ahead. Before they could put the binoculars up for a scan, a large bull surfaced just 200 metres off Mike 1’s starboard bow. The encounter began here at 1110 at 48° 31.8’ N / 124° 50.0’ W.
That first bull was shortly identified as L89, who was traveling near L25. L85 appeared as well, and Mark and Joe realized they were with at least some of the whales absent from the previous day’s encounter. The whales were trending south-southwest, and there were more ahead, so Mike 1 moved off in that direction and confirmed the L77s were present, along with L22. The L117 and L121 were traveling together not far from the L77s, and the rest of the L54s were with L88 just ahead. The animals flipped back and forth for a little while and several times were seen apparently chasing fish, though no predation was confirmed.
After an hour of this back-and-forth behaviour, Mark and Joe had yet to see any whales outside of the L12 and L54 sub-groups, and with reports of J pod in the southern Strait of Georgia and a large group of Southern Residents reportedly inbound off the Victoria waterfront, Mark and Joe concluded that the 14 present were the only ones yet to move into the inside waters of the Salish Sea and ended the encounter 1305 at 48° 31.8’ N / 124° 48.5’ W, now just slightly east of where they began.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-67

He headed southeast to a couple of miles southwest of Sombrio Point and put the hydrophone over the side while having a good scan. Nothing on the hydrophone, but in the calm seas, he could hear the occasional humpback blow within a couple of miles of him and confirmed with binoculars that it seemed they were the only cetaceans around. He turned back to the west and headed out toward Swiftsure Bank in the direction he and Joe had found them two days prior.
The swell was large and fairly confused due to a big ebb tide, and visibility was limited due to fog and light rain. When he got within four miles of the eastern edge of Swiftsure Bank, he came across a lot of birdlife with a small aggregation of humpbacks and several Steller and California sea lions. With no more than a half-mile of visibility, Mark decided to plunk the hydrophone over the side for another listen.
Before he could even conclude that there were any killer whale calls or clicks, he spotted a dorsal fin at the edge of his visibility and then a few more scattered around, confirming members of K and L pods.
For the next 3 hours, he worked through the group, hoping to find some of the ones that weren't seen on the 6th. He was able to confirm L125 along with her mom, L86, although she was swimming with L83. None of these three were seen on the previous encounter.
The group worked mainly east to west, surfing down the large swell and then climbing back uphill to the west. It appeared they were actively foraging with many gulls following them in anticipation for some leftover crumbs; however, only once did he observe a gull swooping down to the water, and it came up empty-handed. At 1410, over three hours from the start of the encounter, the whales were still almost in the exact spot where Mark had found them when they vanished! He had taken his eyes off them for less than a minute to grab an apple out of his cooler, and after a long scan, while he stood up on the front of the console to see above the swell, there wasn't a single fin to be seen. He decided to end the encounter as it seemed like a tall order to refind them in the limited visibility and swell but headed north toward Nitinat on the line they had taken two days prior to see if they were repeating their behaviour. After traveling two miles north, he turned back toward where he had lost them on a track slightly west of his reciprocal heading before receiving a radio call from his colleague Matt Burnaby that he had come across a small group of killer whales three miles to the east of Mike 1. The distance seemed too far to be the same whales that Mark had been 15 minutes prior, but perhaps a lead group had pushed off to the east earlier. The first whale he was able to confirm was L72 which he hadn't seen today, nor were he and Joe able to locate on the encounter two days prior! There appeared to be a fair number of animals spread out tracking north towards the Vancouver Island shoreline. Mark could conclude that the entire group that he had earlier and a few others that he hadn't seen, such as L72 and her son L105 were also present. Once the most inshore animals made it within a half-mile of the beach, the group turned to the northwest with a north-south spread.
Mark ended the encounter at 1551 off of Carmanah Rocks (48 37.2/124 46.8) with L82 traveling alone inshore of the rest of the group. He was fairly confident that it was all of K pod and Ls less the L12s and L54s.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-66

Having had reports of Southern Residents in the area over the past week, they first aimed offshore and then toward the Bank.
After about an hour of running time, they decided to drop a hydrophone and scan both visually and acoustically. They spotted a few sparse humpbacks before hearing what sounded like echolocation clicks! They carried on west in anticipation and very shortly spotted several distinctive dorsal fins cresting the swell. The animals were two miles from them, but as Mark and Joe closed the gap, they began to realize just how many animals were present, with more popping up between the bulls they had initially detected.
The encounter began at 1300 at 48° 30.7’ N / 124° 49.6’ W, with most members of K pod tightly grouped and charging north toward Nitinat on the Vancouver Island shore. The Mike 1 crew noticed several more animals ahead of the K pod whales, so they made their way there and found L25 and the L54s, including L88. The L12s and L22s, along with L85, traveled near this group as all continued toward the Island. K16 and K35 were just ahead of this loose grouping with L82 and L116 and appeared to be leading the charge today.
As the animals reached approximately 2.0 nm from shore, they fanned out in several directions to forage alone or in pairs. The trailing K pod whales quickly caught up and joined in. After splitting, the bulk of K pod again formed a large social group. This behaviour carried on for 10 minutes. Mark and Joe decided to move on in hopes of documenting some predation as all of the observed whales, including a boisterous L116, were foraging west. The animals were at this point spread across several miles, and after spotting and photographing L87, they decided to end the encounter at 1616 at 48° 37.9’ N / 124° 56.8’ W, with both L87 and L88 now heading back offshore roughly 300 m from one another.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-65

After giving some of the fog a chance to burn off, Michael, Charli, and Dave met down at Snug Harbor and left in the boat a little after 1100. We arrived on scene at 1136 about one and a half to two miles due south of Eagle Point.
The whales were spread out in singles and small groups and were all generally heading up Haro Strait. The first whales we saw were a loose group that contained all the J19s plus J42 and J53. These whales looked like they may have been chasing a fish as we were arriving. J53 broke off and left while the other five whales formed a bit tighter group while heading due north inshore toward Eagle Point. This group was acting social and there was some tactile behavior going on. We left them and headed south and found J26 traveling up island by himself off American Camp. After leaving J26, we found J38 chasing a salmon south of False Bay. South of J38, we found J44, J47, and J49 in a group together. These three were being social, tactile, and non-directional. About a quarter mile to the south and offshore of this threesome, we found another group that included the J31s (minus J51), J35s (minus J47), J40, J46, and J53. This group was loosely spread and seemed to be actively engaged in chasing fish. Both J31 and J35 drifted off in opposite directions although they stayed in the general area and occasionally drifted back nearer to the action.

In an effort to find some of the J pod whales we had not seen yet that day, we then headed further south. Even though we scanned with binoculars, we could only find J45 foraging by himself down there. We left him pointed southeast and headed back north toward False Bay. We saw J40 again and then J22 and J38 off False Bay. J22 and J38 were spread out, foraging and non-directional. North of these two, we saw J26 again as he headed northerly up island and inshore.

At 14:42, the team left Snug and headed north towards Boundary Pass. The team arrived on scene with the whales south of East Point at 15:26.

The whales were very spread out, and headed down Boundary Pass. Several small groups were close to shore, with other groups and singles spread well across the pass. The first whale the team encountered was J39, apparently foraging on his own. The team next encountered adult male J26, who soon joined up with a group composed of other J16s, J16 and J36, along with J31 and young daughter J56. This group was fairly surface active, with some breaches and very impressive cartwheels from J26.

The team then moved southwest of this group, moving towards the leaders. They found J46 and J53 foraging together a ways ahead, and further towards the front found J27 travelling with J31 and J56, with J40 nearby. Quite a ways down the pass from these whales, near Blunden Island, were the J35s. J35 and J57 travelled close together, with J47 quite a ways off shore of them. J44 was photographed travelling ahead of these whales on his own.

The team kept working their way to the front of the group. As they began to near Turn Point, they found the J19s working a tide line. Another whale was photographed nearby, who turned out to be J36, who had made her way to the front of the group while the team was with other sets of whales. The whales began to pick up speed, and J36 joined in closer to the J19s. Other groups of whales came porpoising towards Turn Point from behind the team, including J47, J16, and J42. J42 was one of two whales that the team had not photographed during their previous encounter in the Strait of Georgia. As J16 and the others continued towards Turn Point, J42 took a moment to mill near the research vessel before continuing on her way.

The team stayed with the group for a while, but soon let them get ahead so they could photograph the rest of the pod as they passed by. They once again encountered J39 as he passed on his own. He was followed by a large, tight group of porpoising whales, made up of the J22s, the J37s, the J31s, and J40.

Dave, Michael, and Charli decided to deploy and head up Boundary Pass, hoping to find the group as they exited Active Pass on their way into Georgia Strait. However, they did not find the group as they approached the pass. Around 10:30, the whales were re-acquired off the coal docks north of Point Roberts. The team arrived on scene at 11:18 and began their encounter.

When the team arrived, the whales were very spread out, generally heading northwest. The team first found a trio of whales, which turned out to be the J41s, including new calf J58. After this group passed the team, J40 and J53 began foraging in the area near the research vessel, followed by J46, J35 and new calf J57, also foraging, with J47 near by. J57 and J35 took a moment to socialize with each other near the boat for a before continuing on their way. J19 was the next whale encountered, followed by J45. The whales changed direction, and began moving southeast down the strait.

The team spotted an adult male a few hundred yards away. A distant photo showed that this was L88, a slight surprise as previous reports of the group suggested it was only members of J pod. L88 joined up with J45, and the two males travelled together for a while. They were soon joined by a third whale, J46, who stayed in front of the two others. A short way ahead of this group, the team located J31 and J56. L88 broke off from J45 and J46 and began following this mother and daughter pair.

The team moved over to a group of young whales and sprouters they had seen in the distance. They found J39, J44, L108, and L117, all young males, socializing together in a tight group. Ahead of them was a single female, L54, confirming that all members of the L54 subgroup were present with the J pod members. The team moved further down the strait, and encountered a pair of adult males foraging in the same area, L88 and J26. Near this pair was J40, along with a good chunk of the J17 matriline, J46, J44, and J53. Further inshore were two more pairs of whales. The first was J38, starting to look like an adult male, and young male J49. Further inshore from them was J16 and adult daughter J36.

The team then once again came across the J35 matriline, with J57 rolling around on his mom, and J47 staying peripheral. Behind them were members of the J11 matriline, J31, J56, and adult male J27, joined by J40, with J53 nearby. This collection of whales were pretty social, with some spyhops and one big breach from J53. The two youngest calves, J57 and J58, joined up for a bit of play, with J46 nearby “babysitting.”

The team broke off from this group, and found another set of socializing whales. This one was an all male group composed of J49, J51, and L108, engaging in a lot of socio-sexual behavior. Nearby, they found J49’s mom, J37, foraging on her own. As the team moved further down the strait, the again encountered J39, now travelling on his own. Finally, the team encounter L54 on her own, with her son L117 nearby socializing with J38. As the team left the whales at 16:48, the whales were headed down the strait, still very spread out.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-62

He left Oak Bay and headed west with George Hamilton immediately as they were doing some boat maintenance and conveniently had all of their gear with them.
They spotted the first group of animals close to shore off of the Sooke harbour mouth and started the encounter at 1328. The lead group included J38, J37, J22, J51, and J58, but the rest of J pod were close behind, and all were moving steadily towards Secretary Island. When they got within a quarter-mile of Secretary Island, J38, J22, and J37 started to quicken the pace, almost high speed porpoising for a minute as though they were chasing salmon. J51 did three breaches as he and J58 passed within a few metres of the kelp bed on the south side of the island. The entire pod then split up and slowly worked their way offshore, with a few foraging individuals double back slightly to the west. Mark and George scanned for others to the west but were only able to re-sight members of J pod that they had seen previously upon arrival when they were grouped up. J27 had fallen back close to the rear of the group that J16 and J26 had established and were also angling offshore.
The Mike 1 crew decided to end the encounter at 1428 southwest of Bechey Head as they could see that the animals were very spread out doing long foraging dives and appeared to be moving very slowly against the ebb current.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-61

The team had had an encounter (#58) with the L54s and L88 in Mitchell Bay on August 25th as the small group headed north at dusk. The L54s and L88 had been up in the Strait of Georgia since then and were now coming back down. It was not a nice day. The water out in front of CWR in Andrews Bay had been rough before we left and we would likely have to leave the whales once they neared Kellett Bluff. The water was indeed chunky as we made our way toward Kellett Bluff. There was a bit of tidal action going on near the bluff that made for some four foot standing waves we had to slog through. The water got a little calmer off north Henry Island but we were heading with it. The whales were reported to be still off Turn Point so we kept heading that direction.
We arrived on scene about a mile and a half south of Turn Point at 1444. The whales had moved offshore to about mid-strait where the water was the roughest. The L54s and L88 were spread out and heading south fairly quickly into 2-3 foot seas. The first whale we saw and approached was L88. He was surfacing regularly and we got a good right side shot on him despite the difficult water conditions. About 300 yards or so to the west of L88, we saw L108. L108’s dorsal fin has grown since last year and he is now an obvious sprouter. L117 was about 100 yards behind L108 and he quickly caught up and joined his brother. These two were charging enthusiastically into the slop and L108 breached a few times. The whales stopped and milled abruptly before pointing east and moving closer to L88. L54 herself was remaining scarce but was seen about a half mile or so to the southeast of the other three whales. L108 and L117 joined L88 and continued south as a group although occasionally one whale would drift off from the others before coming back. The whales stopped and milled on a couple of occasions before continuing south in a bit of a rowdy manner. L108 breached again and we later realized that both L88 and L108 had been dragging a long strand of kelp with them. Around 1520, we decided to go look for L54 who had been ahead and inshore of the other three. By the time we had a bead on her and were making our way there, L54 turned west and went to join the other three. We got a proof of presence shot on L54 and then ended the encounter at 1529 off north Henry Island.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-60

The whales were reported as spread out, and this combined with their travel pattern made Michael and Charli suspect that they may be southern residents inbound from the Strait of Juan de Fuca. As they prepared to go investigate on Orcinus, the whales were identified over the radio not as southern residents, but as members of the T60 matriline. Michael and Charli decided to deploy anyways, as in their last encounter with this group they had focused on drone operations, and were not satisfied with the photo IDs they had gotten on this group.

Michael and Charli left the dock at 11:32, and headed south along the west side of San Juan Island. During the team’s transit, the whales had altered their course further to the south, and by the time the team arrived at 12:15 the whales were approaching Iceberg Point. While originally reported as spread, the T60s (without T60D and T60E, who have been travelling separately) along with T2B and T59 had grouped up. When they hit the Lopez Island shoreline, they turned right, heading further east along the southern side of the island.

The team paralleled them as they stuck close to shore, moving in for a photo ID pass as the whales approached the entrance to Aleck Bay. The whales were close to shore, moving in a tight group. T60 and T60G stayed close together, while T60C was glued to T2B. As the whales passed Hughes Bay, the team slowly went behind them to get on their other side, hoping to get some usable left-side photos despite the fact that the photos would be fairly back-lit. The whales went on a long dive, and next came up several hundred yards from the vessel, approaching the western tip of Colville Island. The team caught up with them as they patrolled the northern side of the island, allowing the team to get a few backlit lefts. When they got to the eastern tip of the island, the whales stuck to the shoreline, circling the island. The team left = at 13:11, as the whales hunted seals in the kelp along the rocky shore.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-59

At 19:30, both Charli and Sara saw a single male killer whale on the Westside of San Juan Island, between San Juan County park and the Center for Whale Research. Both recognized that the whale had a large finger on its left saddle, a distinctly resident killer whale feature. They contacted Michael, and the team met at Snug just a few minute later, getting off the dock at 19:54.

The team headed out to Mitchell Bay, initially heading down island before seeing blows to the north, off the south side of Henry Island. The team started their encounter at 20:00. They found two whales, a young male and a juvenile, that they initially could not identify in the dark. In front of this pair was an adult female with an open saddle patch on her left side. The team soon realized that these whales were L108, L117, and L54, the remaining members of the L54 matriline, and that the large male seen off the west side was likely L88, a whale who consistently travels with them.

L54 occasionally tailslapped as she dove, while the two young males socialized and moved a bit further west. The team stayed with L54 for a while, keeping her on their starboard, while the two young males eventually made their way to the team’s port side. Flora spotted a large fin further off shore, presumably L88. Michael was initially unsure about whether the team could safely get to him out in the strait as the light was fading. However, he soon surfaced only a few hundred yards further out than the team, so they made their way to him. Photographs of his right side confirmed that it was L88. He surfaced slowly and frequently, apparently quite relaxed. The team stayed with him for a few minutes, before calling the encounter and heading back to the dock at 20:22.

The team got up early the next morning to search the area for the L54s, along with SR3 and UW research vessels, but despite a large coordinated search no one was able to relocate them the next day.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-58

The team had gotten fairly good photos of this group during the summer, but hadn’t yet been able to get any behavioral footage using the drone, so they were eager for the whales to make their way into US waters (and airspace). In the early afternoon, the whales made their way down Plumber Sound and into Boundary Pass, heading for the US/Canada border in reportedly good conditions.

Michael, Charli, and Sara left Snug at 14:36, heading north. They arrived on scene at 15:13, just south of Saturna Island. The whales hadn’t yet crossed the border to allow the team to launch the research drone, but they were heading east/southeast, so the team just needed to bide their time. At 15:30, the team launched the drone for the first flight of the day. The whales were uncharacteristically spread out in ones and twos, and exhibiting short surface intervals. Initially, the team was only able to do consistent follows over T37B1. As the whales approached the red buoy marking the point where the border turns to the north, they grouped up and took a dramatic turn southeast towards Point Doughty, allowing the team to get some footage of the whole group. Soon, however, they once again split up into ones and twos. T34 and T34B were the furthest east, followed by T34A and T37B1, with T37 and T37B the furthest west. Eventually the T37s grouped up and listed to the west, while the T34s remained in the same vicinity. The team initially decided to stick with the T34s, continuing to do drone flights and photo ID.

After some time, it became apparent to the team that T34A’s calf, T34A1, had not yet made an appearance during their encounter. Later review of the drone footage and photographs would confirm that T34A1 was not with T34A at all during the encounter. After one last flight with most of the T34s, the team broke off to see if perhaps T34A1 was travelling with the T37s. The team followed the T37s as the made their way across the north side of Point Doughty, and then tucked close to shore as they passed North Beach. A comprehensive photo ID pass on this group confirmed that T34A1 was not with them either. A single encounter is not enough to definitively rule a whale missing, however it is unusual to not locate a calf as young as T34A1 during an encounter where their mother is present. It is possible that T34A1 was off on their own somewhere within vocal range during this encounter, but future surveys of the group will be key in determining what’s happened to the calf.

At 17:15, the team arrived on scene Cowlitz Bay, on the southwest side of Waldron Island. The whales were in a resting pattern, logging at the surface for some intervals and then taking long dives with unpredictable headings between surfacing sequences. After the first sequence, the whales split into two groups of two as the rounded Sandy Point and headed northeast. The team attempted a few photo ID passes, bust between the unpredictable direction changes and not wanting to disturb the whales’ resting pattern by moving at high speeds, wasn’t able to get close for proper ID shots and decided to focus on drone follows.

Great water conditions and perfect lighting provided excellent views of this group of whales. The whales rejoined into a single group as they approached Skipjack and Bare Island, still resting and socializing. When they reached Bare Island, the whales split up and encircled the island, apparently making multiple seal kills in the kelp beds around the rocks before meeting up on the north side of the island and continuing northeast, with T60 carrying a seal in her mouth.

A bit north of Bare Island, the whales once again split up, spread out, and began milling. T60C and T2B apparently did another hunt together, leaving a large pool of blood and, according to a whale watch vessel on scene, an intact seal carcass behind them.

At 14:39, the team arrived on scene just off San Juan County Park, with a pair of whales that turned out to be T77C and T77D. While the team had photographed these whales recently, they were interested to see how T77C’s wound had continued to heal, and to collect behavioral data using drone follows.

The two whales made their way up the west side of the island, crossing the mouth of Mitchell Bay and heading into Open Bay. There, the team observed them initiate a prey pursuit dive, characterized by both whales turning belly-up before quickly diving. The whales next surfaced close to shore, apparently pursuing a seal, but they did not successfully make a kill.

The whales hugged the shoreline tightly as they continued north along Henry Island, still in hunting mode. They tucked close to a pebble beach, and from the drone the team observed them again unsuccessfully pursue a harbor seal, which escaped into the shallows, followed immediately by another unsuccessful pursuit of a nearby river otter.

After their unsuccessful hunts, the pair of siblings made their way towards Battleship, where they circled the island multiple times, finally making successful seal kills. While observing the whales, the team heard reports of a group of six whales, consisting of most of the T60s, T2B, and T59 coming south through President Channel.

They quickly mustered and headed to Snug, leaving the dock at 12:09. En route, they heard that the whales had been IDed as the T18s. While the team had successfully gotten ID photos of these whales in recent encounters, weather and location had prevented drone flights. The team decided to focus on collecting behavioral data on the group using the drone, rather than doing a photo ID focused encounter.

Michael and Charli arrived on scene at 12:46 near Yellow Island. When they arrived the whales had split into two groups, with T19B and T19 near the team and T18 and T19C much further east and out of sight. The team took some time to get the lay of the land, as the whales bounced between the several small islands in the area.

At 13:15, the eastern whales barreled west to meet up with the others. When the whales came together, the team took the opportunity to launch their research drone and begin some behavioral sampling.

The team mobilized and left the dock at 10:31, crossing Haro Strait and arriving on scene just west of Discovery Island at 11:07.

The T18s were again split into two pairs, with T19 and T19B taking the lead followed by T18 and T19C. The whales rounded the north side of the islands, following the shoreline and making their way to the eastern side of the islands. The team paralleled them for a few minutes, before breaking away as the whales went inshore of Fulford Reef. From a distance, the team observed T19 appear to make a kill of a harbor seal inside the reef.

As the whales passed the reef, the team slowly made their way inshore to get a better chance to photograph the group. The team set up to let the whales pass about 80 yards off their starboard side. The whales then went down for a several minute long dive.

Michael, Charli, and Flora left the harbor at 12:44 to head down island to search for this group, planning to do photo ID passes and drone follows.

At 13:10, the team arrived on scene southwest of False Bay, with a group of 4 whales. The team identified the whales as T101, T101A, and T101B, with a single extra whale, all headed slowly southeast following the San Juan shoreline. After reviewing photos, the team later identified the extra whale as T77C, who had been travelling with his sister T77D and T49A2 for the last few days, but had apparently broken off from these two to visit with the T101s.

As the team tried to get in position for photo ID passes, the whales exhibited dive times of 3 to 5 minutes, and made zig-zagging direction changes, eventually flipping and heading back north towards False Bay. The whales split into two groups, the leaders being T101 and T77C, and the followers being T101A and T101B. The team got into position for a photo ID pass on T101A and T101B. As the team paralleled the whales, the whales made a direction change and headed for the boat. The team shut off the engine to allow the whales to pass by them, before heading for the leading group.
As the team made their way to the leaders, T77C broke off from the group, heading west. Luckily, Charli managed to get a couple frames of him as he left, allowing us to identify him later. After T77C left, the T101s formed back up into a single group, and made their way further inshore. After a few more minutes of paralleling the whales, the University of Washington research vessel Moja arrived on scene to begin looking for fecal samples. The CWR team backed away from the whales to launch their drone to do behavioral observations and search for fecal samples, while Moja followed behind the whales at about 400 hundred yards.

The whales hugged the shoreline tightly, swimming and rolling through kelp forests as they made their way up the San Juan coast. As they approached the Lime Kiln lighthouse at 15:20, the team landed the drone to respect the half mile exclusion zone around the park. After the drone landed, the team learned that Moja had found a fecal sample, a very rare event when studying Bigg’s killer whales.

The team met up with the T101s north of Lime Kiln, as the whales continued to hug the shoreline.

The team arrived on scene about a half mile north of Jones Island at 16:20. The whole matriline was in a single tight group, very slowly making their way north in a resting pattern. Michael brought Orcinus in for a left side photo ID pass on the group, who were extremely cooperative and relaxed. After documenting the group photographically, the team backed out and prepared to launch the drone for behavioral observations and scat collection.

The whales continued their slow movement northeast into President Channel, staying fairly close to the Orcas shoreline. Uncharacteristically for transients, the group stayed close to the surface between their surfacing intervals, allowing for long, continuous follows using the drone. A bit after 17:00, the whales crossed the Channel to the Waldron Island side, and began heading due north.

While the water was nearly flat calm, the combination of glassy water and overcast skies made it difficult to observe the whales underwater from the drone, and even more difficult to potentially catch any scat samples that may appear. The team ended drone operations at 17:35, but decided to try for one more photo ID pass before heading home.

The team slowly caught up with the whales and got into position. The whales had begun to exhibit very long dives between surfacing sequences, so determining exactly where they’d come up next was a challenge. Luckily, the whales surfaced about 80 yards off Orcinus’s bow, allowing the team to ooze into position for one last photo ID pass as the light began to fade. After getting some right side photos to go along with the lefts from the start of the encounter, the team left the scene at 17:56 and headed back to the dock at Snug.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-50

Michael coordinated with the UW scat project to head out and try to document at least a few of these groups, while also collecting behavioral data from the drone and potentially finding scat samples for the UW project.

Michael and Charli left the dock at 13:03, and arrived on scene with the T99 matriline in North Pass as they made their way to the west side of Jones Island. The team first made a couple brief photo ID passes to document the current looks of the group, as they hadn't been photographed by the CWR in several months. Soon, the UW research vessel Moja arrived on scene, and Michael and Charli launched the drone to record behavioral data and search for scat samples.
The whales made their way due north towards Waldron Island, making fairly good speed. The whales stayed in a single tight group, and engaged in occasional social contact as they made their way towards Cowlitz Bay. Around 15:00, the group tucked way into the bay and slowed down considerably, taking a moment to rest and socialize before continuing on their way.

After exiting the bay, the whales split into two groups, with T99 and her youngest offspring T99D travelling a ways away from T99B and T99C. The team stayed with the group as they made their way north into Boundary Pass, however as the team can't fly their drone in Canadian airspace, they decided to leave the group before they got to the border, and at 16:00 left the scene to head south in search of another group of whales that had been reported nearby (see Encounter 50).",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-49

At 14:50, the team arrived on scene with the whales about a mile southeast of Reuben Tarte Park.

The whales were split into two tight groups, one much further inshore than the other. The team first got photos of the offshore group, which contained T37 and the T34s. After a brief pass on this group, the team pulled offshore as the whales made their way past Reuben Tarte, and rounded the corner into Spieden Channel.

Once the whales were in Spieden, the team slowly made their way inshore to try to document the rest of the whales present. As they made their way towards the inshore subgroup, the whales suddenly cut off shore and made their way to meet up with the other group. After meeting up, the whales turned towards a group of private boats that had been at whale watching distance, briefly ""mugging"" these vessels before continuing west through the channel.

The team managed to get another photo ID pass as the whales headed west in a tight group. As they passed, T34A1 had fallen a bit behind and quickly porpoised to catch up with the group. As the whales passed the research vessel, one of the adults took a moment to harass what appeared to be a Common Murre fledgeling. The whale took a few lunges as the bird, and then continued on its way, leaving the bird shaken and possibly injured but still alive and floating.

The team left the whales at 15:52, as they continued to head west through the northern side of Spieden Channel.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-48

At 12:53, Michael, Charli, Nikhela, and Minola left Snug Harbor in Orcinus and headed to the Cactus Islands, arriving on scene at 13:23.

When the team arrived on scene, the whales were hugging the shoreline of Ripple Island, apparently hunting and socializing. After a few looks, it became clear that these where not the T37As, but were in fact a group of three immature whales, T77C, T77D, and T49A2.

As the whales were close to shore, the team was not initially able to get close for good photo ID passes. Instead, they launched their research drone for a flight. However, as Ripple Island is a nature reserve, the team could not approach closely with the drone, and filmed from a distance. The team did observe some sociosexual behavior as the whales circled the island.

After a few laps around the island and a drone flight, the team obtained some useful images of the group. T77C's wound on his left side, which was first observed in June, is almost completely healed, leaving only a small indent where the wound used to be.

The team stayed with the whales for only a brief time, leaving the scene at 14:30 as reports of a second larger group of whales in San Juan Channel came through over the radio (see Encounter 48).

We also received reports that a group of Bigg’s killer whales, identified as the T37As, were slowly moving north through Haro Strait. While the southern residents were still quite a ways out, the team decided to try to maximize their time by first getting a quick photo-ID pass of the T37As, and then wait for the residents to make an appearance.
Michael, Katie, and Lodie left Snug Harbor just after 1300 and headed south down the west side of San Juan Island. They arrived on scene at 1320, about a mile west of Lime Kiln Point. The T37As were in a tight group resting, moving north-northeast. The whales gave only brief surfacing sequences and long downtimes. The whales hugged close to the shore of San Juan at Deadman’s Bay, and very slowly made their way up the shoreline of Lime Kiln park, as the team observed from a distance. Once the whales made it north of Lime Kiln, the team attempted to parallel them and do one or two photo ID passes. After a couple brief passes, the team had acquired proof of presence shots of all individuals. The team ended the encounter on the south end of Andrew’s Bay at 1457 and headed down south to wait for the residents to arrive. Unfortunately, weather conditions quickly deteriorated, and the residents made their way into the islands very slowly.

One whale had an open saddle and looked like it was probably K22. This, of course, got everyone down here excited that we would probably have southern residents within 48 hours. SRs used to take three to four days to make their way down from Johnstone Strait but are now not stopping much to forage on the way. Lots of people were up early on the morning of July 1st in anticipation of SRs showing up. The SR3 Drone team was off the dock first and made it up to the East Point area to wait for any whales coming down. Michael and Dave were both over at CWR before 0845 and eventually made a plan to go help in the search. While we were loading up in the driveway, Katie called to relay a sighting of whales heading south near Thatcher Pass from our friend Traci Walter who was on the morning ferry. Traci said it looked like a good group of whales and could very well be residents. This changed our plan of heading up toward Alden Bank and we ended up headed down the west side of SJI instead after leaving Snug Harbor at 0945. Haro Strait was fairly sloppy until around False Bay which slowed our progress but it then smoothed out. The day ended up being calm but there was an annoying leftover lump that had us all still rocking when we got home later. We made it on scene at the south end of Rosario Strait by 1050 about mid-strait off Watmough Head.
The whales were very spread out and foraging. The first whales we saw were K12 and K37 who were spread by a couple of hundred yards and pointed southeast. A third whale was in the area but slipped away. After looking at photos later, this third animal turned out to be K38. The next whale we saw was K20 and then K38 also showed up in the general area. The whales turned east past Lawson Reef toward Deception Pass. We could tell that there were others over nearer to Deception Island but they were too far away to keep track of. We saw K33 pointed southwest about a mile and a half southwest of West Point on Whidbey Island. K22 showed up and briefly joined K33 before they spread out again and began to head west. After a little searching, we then spotted a lone sprouter about a mile to the north of us. This turned out to be K42 and he was charging west in that annoying calm lump. K42’s dorsal fin had grown significantly since we last saw him about seven months earlier.
By 1300, all the whales were heading quickly west spread out from near the south Lopez Island shoreline to several miles offshore. We found K27 and K44 spread by about 75 yards charging west. Then we found K22, K33, and K37 again all roughly paralleling each other with several hundred yards between them. After that, we saw K20 and K38 again-also spread. K34 was the whale furthest offshore-a good three to four miles off of Iceberg Point. The whales turned northwest and began heading up San Juan Island off South Beach.
>From the whales we had been seeing, we knew we had the K12, K13, and K14 matrilines present. While we felt confident at that point that the K16s and K21 were not present, we still needed to find the rest of the K14s and K43. We eventually spotted K26 off the flagpole at American Camp. He was also charging up island but then found a fish and stopped to give chase. We briefly saw K14 and K36 inshore up closer to Eagle Point. We then had a couple of backlit whales speed past us heading north. This was K43 and K44 and they started milling too. K26 approached from the south and goosed K43 as she did a big spyhop. He then headed north in a straight line and we were able to get some good shots of him. K26 has three new nicks in the top half of his dorsal fin. We also got a few more shots of K14, K36, and K44 as they moved up towards Hannah Heights. Around 1610, several whales turned due south and began heading offshore. We turned around too and briefly saw K20 and K36 again before we decided to head back inshore one more time. There were a few whales moving slowly down island just south of False Bay. We saw K33 again and then K12 and K37 behind him. K12 looked like she might have been chasing a salmon before she continued slowly southeast about a mile northwest of Eagle Point. We ended the encounter there at 1707 after K12 arched and gave us a nice right side shot.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-45

The whales sounded like they were going to stay on the U.S. side of the border so we headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1310. We arrived on scene about a mile southwest of the north buoy of Hein Bank at 1355. A group that included T36, T36B, T36B3, T77C, and T125A were milling and socializing with each other and were not really going anywhere. Another group including T128 was about three quarters of a mile to the southwest of these whales. We got some photos of the first group including a shot of T77's odd looking wound that seems to be healing. We then started heading toward the other group but they turned north and started to charge back toward the first group before we could get there. All nine whales present were then in one loose socializing group pointed slowly north toward Salmon Bank.
We made sure we had a proof of presence of all the whales in the group before we backed off some so Michael could launch his drone for his social behavior study. Since the whales weren’t moving fast at all and also weren’t going on long dives, Michael got a full battery’s worth of video on the first flight. We then recovered the drone, got a few more photos, and then Michael got another long flight in while the whales continued to travel very slowly north. A little while earlier, T49C had been found at the bottom of Rosario Strait and he was now reported to have been heading west along the Lopez Island shoreline. At one point, all the whales in the group we were with made a turn to the east and it appeared like they must have heard T49C say something. We thought he might show up and join the group but they soon pointed back north toward Salmon Bank. We left the group around 1510 about one mile southwest of the Salmon Bank Buoy to go in search of T49C. We headed inshore toward Long Island before looking through the binocs and finding the boats who were with T49C a good two miles to the south of us. We took off in that direction and got to T49C around 1535 as he was charging west near MacArthur Bank. T49C continued fast traveling westerly on a line that would take him north of Hein Bank and in the direction of Constance Bank. T49C was cooperative and maintaining a straight line while he was up for his short dives. We ended the encounter at 1610 approximately a mile north of the north buoy at Hein Bank.
Another group of transients had been found just north of CWR so we decided to see if we could get them on the way home. The larger group had headed north toward Cattle Pass and Whale Rock before heading up San Juan Channel. Due to poor cell phone service, we did not get the message that Mark had had an encounter with the T65Bs and T75Cs earlier in the day. These were the whales that had hit the west side of San Juan Island earlier and had headed up island. We got on scene with the T65Bs and T75Cs off the north end of Henry Island and had a brief encounter with them near Battleship Island as they headed slowly north. Mark showed up a little later in a yellow boat and we realized our encounter mix up after talking on the radio. We decided to lump our encounter in with Mark’s encounter 43 since he had the last look at them that day anyway. Right before we left the T65Bs and T75Cs, we heard that a pair of humpbacks were seen heading north off Lime Kiln. We headed back home toward Snug Harbor and found the humpbacks off Kellett Bluff. It was a mother and calf pair and they were traveling slowly north with no fluking. The adult whale looked really skinny and we hoped this was because she was still nursing.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-44

They fired up Mike 1 and departed the harbour at 0940. As they approached Race Rocks it was clear that thick fog in the Pass could make finding the whales difficult. At this point, a commercial whale-watch boat had located the animals, and confirmed their eastbound direction of travel, though they had not been seen in over ten minutes.
Mike 1 came to a stop in the fog and listened for blows; Mark heard two after roughly six minutes, but nothing further. They decided to round the shore of Bentinck Island and with the help of a MMO colleague monitoring the military blasting at Bentick Island they were soon able to relocate the whales, now clear of the fog and still eastbound. The encounter began at 1050 at 48° 18.6’ N / 123° 31.3’ W with just two animals, shortly confirmed to be T075C and her young offspring T075C2. After following the pair for a sequence of breaths, three more animals were spotted just ahead of them. The T075Cs and Mike 1 soon caught up to the leading T065Bs. They dove, and were next seen a mile astern of the research boat, now travelling northwest.
The five whales had grouped up and significantly slowed their pace through the water, though were still making good time in a strong flood current. As they continued north-northwest for Royal Roads the Mike 1 crew moved off, staying well outside a kilometer as the whales began several sequences of 10 to 12-minute dives followed by just 1-2 minutes of surfacing. After 45 minutes of restful wandering and no sign of predation, Mark and Joe ended the encounter at 48° 23.5’ N / 123° 25.8’ W, just southwest of Victoria, at 1225 and entered the harbour. The group of five were last seen trending to the east, and were later encountered by Dave at Battleship Island.

We then headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1145. We arrived on scene north of Beaumont Shoal at 1205 but the whales had taken a turn to the northwest and were now too far on the Canadian side of the border to get a good look at. We looked at them through binoculars while we debated waiting it out to see if they crossed back across the border versus going home and trying to get some work done. It was starting to look grim so we reluctantly pointed toward home. We were not hurrying home but were a couple miles from the scene when we heard that the whales had once again changed direction and were crossing to the US side. This time they had a much better direction for keeping them on the US side so we hurried back.
The encounter started at 1258 maybe a quarter of a mile from the border off Hannah Heights. Most of the whales were in one large tight group heading slowly north. T65A2 and T37B1 were traveling and interacting with one another on the periphery of the larger group. They sometimes moved as far as a couple of hundred yards to the east of the big group but would repeatedly turn and approach the group again. Both T65A2 and T37A1 would briefly join with the others throughout the encounter.

It was reported to be a group of twelve animals so we decided to go see who they were. We headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 0740. We were passing Friday Harbor when Michael spotted whales off the east side of Turn Island. The whales were milling and the encounter began at 0815. The first two whales we saw were T46B2 and T46B3 and they were circling and diving in the same general area. They went down on a long dive and then T46B, T46B4, and T46B6 came up and began circling and milling in the same area as the other two. It was obvious that the whales had a seal pinned on the bottom and were taking turns waiting it out. While she was up for her short dives, T46B6 came over to the boat (shutdown) once to check us out. The trio went on their long dive and then T46B2 and T46B3 came up again. While they were up, T46B2 and T46B3 also came over to the boat to check us out. T46B2 surfaced slowly right alongside the boat and she seemed to be a very big whale and was extremely round around the middle. At age 13, she is likely to be pregnant. These two went down again and the other three began surfacing. While they were up, T46B6 appeared to get bored and she began doing tail waves.
Around 0840, the whales began heading west toward the Turn Island shoreline like they may have been shadowing a seal making a break for it. We never saw the seal, though. All the whales went on a long dive and they came up near the reef on the north side of Turn Island. The whales then moved right back to where they were milling before and continued milling again off the east side of Turn Island. The whales were still milling off the east side of Turn Island when we ended the encounter at 0900. We were just a little disappointed that we only had the T46Bs but it was a gorgeous morning so we decided to head down SJ Channel and go on a whale search. We headed out Cattle Pass and did a big loop around Hein Bank before heading back toward San Juan Island but did not see any more whales. We met up with “Moja” off False Bay and Michael switched boats in order to fly the drone over the T46Bs for his behavior study and to help look for whale poop. Dave headed to the fuel dock and then went home. Later in the day, T46B1 and T46B1A showed up and joined the rest of the T46Bs who had headed south in SJ Channel and had exited Cattle Pass earlier.

They turned back into shore and were soon with a group of 10-15 killer whales. They started the encounter at 0825, observing two groups travelling quite far apart, with a single bull and female travelling inshore and behind a large group of roughly 10 females and juveniles. The youngsters were quite playful, with several spyhops and rolls observed as the whales travelled east at a good pace. The large group was determined to be composed of the rare T064Bs and T068Cs, a more commonly encountered T077 and her youngest offspring T077E, and two animals travelling away from their given matrilines of late, T037A1 and T065A5. The animals to the north of the group were T049C and T068C1. Eventually the groups redistributed, with the T068Cs joining C1 to the north of the action and slowing significantly, while T049C broke off to the southeast in an effort to catch up to a still fast-paced group of T064Bs, T077s, T037A1 and T065A5. Mark and Joe ended the encounter then, at 0918, two nautical miles SE of San Simon Point.

Later, on their return from the western reaches of the Juan de Fuca, the Mike 1 crew again came across that lead group, including T049C, now finishing off a predation just northeast of Race Rocks before moving quickly toward the Victoria waterfront.

A quick check of fuel, weather, and time suggested that perhaps two encounters were possible, if there were no glitches in the machinery operation. “Chimo” had not left its boathouse yet in 2021, though its engine started up immediately yesterday and it was purring along beautifully at 25 knots in the glass calm Strait of Juan de Fuca.

As the animal surfaced again, it was clear that the bull was traveling on a north-north easterly line toward Mike 1. They began the encounter at 1136.
The bull was apparently just beginning his breathing cycle and surfaced several more times, though he showed little saddle patch in the swell. No matter, the familiar towering fin of L85 is distinct enough! On his second cycle, the ID was confirmed, and Mark and Joe began scanning farther into the deep for more of the L12 and L22 sub-groups. A female appeared just 300 metres from L85; it was L25, the presumed eldest Southern Resident. They also spotted a second grown bull nearly 3/4 of a mile directly astern of L85 but were not able to re-sight him after just two breaths. They instead moved to a pair of animals traveling close together, L77 and L124, who were shortly joined by L119. These three briefly foraged and were heard vocalizing through the aluminum hull of the research boat. Nearby but slightly behind the trio was likely L22, though neither Mark nor Joe was able to photograph her as she dipped in and out of the overhead swell.
After a second fruitless effort to re-find a presumed L89 and photograph L22, the Mike 1 crew turned and traveled slowly up-swell in the direction from which the whales had come. Roughly a mile south-southwest of the spread L12s, they spotted a tight group of three, quickly confirmed to be L54 and her surviving offspring, L108, and L117. All three were traveling steadily toward the others, and their constant companion L88 was shortly spotted just a couple hundred meters behind. He was less directional, circling over possible prey, but no predation was observed before he too moved along.
Mark and Joe ended the encounter there at 1310 at 48° 32.0’ N / 124° 49.5’ W, 5.5 nautical miles SSW of Carmanah Point. Conditions were deteriorating, and it would be a long ride home.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-34

By early afternoon, they had made it as far as the Sea Bird Point, Discovery Island, and turned west. The two departed for a short encounter off the Victoria waterfront. They passed Ogden Point in Mike 1 at 1515 and met the whales 6 minutes later at 48° 22.5 N and 123° 14.6 W, just southwest of Discovery Island. The five animals were the T046Bs, less the dispersed T046B1s, and they were slightly spread while traveling west-southwest steadily toward Constance Bank.
The whales suddenly turned and porpoised roughly a half-mile south before apparently corralling a harbour seal under the surface. The hunt lasted roughly 20 minutes until the distinct smell of pinniped hit the air at 1600. Young T046B4 seemed particularly satisfied with the effort, spyhopping and rolling around with a mess of innards for over ten minutes. The animals eventually finished sharing the spoils and turned west again, T046B4 still with her prize, all surfing the southeast seas toward Constance Bank.

The commercial whale-watch vessel Goldwing had just departed the animals rounding Bentinck Island for Pedder Bay as Mike 1 powered up out of Victoria’s inner harbour at 2002.
Mark soon spotted the whales coming out of Quarantine Cove and began the encounter at 2017 at 48° 21.0 N / 123° 31.6 W. The four animals were spread across 200m travelling very close to the shore of Parker and Parry Bays, and were soon identified as the T069As! Rare visitors to the Salish Sea, the T069As were last documented by the Center in August of 2017 when Dave Ellifrit was on a busman’s holiday at the north end of Vancouver Island with Jared Towers out of Alert Bay. The T069A’s are more often seen along Vancouver Island’s west coast and the central coast of BC. Mark last encountered them over a decade ago in the Salish Sea.
The group made quick work of a harbour seal at 2042 as they combed through kelp beds in about 20 feet of water, and spent just a few minutes prey sharing before moving off in the direction of the Haystock Islets. The matriarch and her eldest, sprouting T069A2, travelled between the Islets and Vancouver Island, while the two youngsters who had been dawdling at the site of the last meal raced to catch up via the east side of Haystock. Mark and Joe momentarily lost sight of the two larger animals as they slipped behind the Islets, but no signs of predation were observed from either pair. As light faded and the whales seemed content to continue their shoreline foraging, Mark and Joe broke off for Victoria at 2102, leaving the whales approaching Albert Head (48° 22.9 N / 123° 30.1 W).

Mark quickly mobilized and met Joe at Mike 1, departing Victoria harbour at 0759. Hanna was onshore in Oak Bay and, in the still air, actually heard the animals before she saw them, roughly the same time that Mark and Joe slowed at the cardinal buoy at the east entrance to Enterprise Channel. She dialed the Mike 1 crew in, and they began the encounter at 0759 at 48° 24.7 N / 123° 17.3 W as the whales surfaced roughly 800 metres off the bow, moving out of Baynes Channel toward Brodie Rock. Even at a distance, T046B2’s distinct notch gave the crew a clue as to the matriline, and on the next breathing cycle, the T046Bs were confirmed, still traveling southwest. The dispersed T046B1s were not present, making a total of five Bigg’s killer whales.
Mark and Joe paced the whales for a few moments until all dove. T046B6 shortly reappeared, taking several breaths before the rest of the whales also popped up, milling almost precisely where they had gone under, apparently harassing some prey beneath them. The surfacing quickly became more animated, and a harbour seal finally broke through the water for a breath in the middle of the fray. The Bigg’s appeared to make quick work of the seal, landing the finishing blow just three minutes after the initial milling was observed. However, one of the young females surfaced with the still struggling seal almost six minutes after that.

Mark came across them in the morning while guiding a Prince of Whales tour southeast of Discovery Island, traveling east with the T099's and the two brothers T125A and T128.
Mark had alerted Dave Ellifrit as they had gone into the United States, but they had turned back across the border into Canada twice on him, and he had headed home, so Mark mobilized Mike 1.
Mark arrived with them at 1418 within a mile of Seabird Point as they were pointed northwest up Haro Strait.
Moments before Mike 1 arrived, T125A and T128 were reported to have broken off from the group and were headed southwest towards Constance Bank.
Mark was quickly able to get great left and right-hand shots of the group as they traveled tight together on a consistent track line and dive pattern, so after 40 minutes, he decided to go and re-find T125A and T128.
Mark came across T128 at 1517 ~1 NM SSE of Staines Point lighthouse at Trial Island traveling southwest for Constance Bank, and his brother, T125A, was paralleling him a half-mile to the south.
Once Mark got left and right side shots of both of them, he ended the encounter at 1517 as they approached Constance Bank.
Mark heard reports that the NW group were pointed back towards San Juan Island, so he alerted Dave that he likely would have a third time lucky crack at them.

The situation was “busy” and it was another fifteen minutes before Dave could get close enough to get the first photos. The whales zigged offshore a little and then on the next series they zagged back toward the Stuart Island shoreline. It took longer than normal but the whales finally showed themselves to be the T75Bs. T75B has a new calf of the year, T75B4. The T65As plus T77 and T77E were also reported to be heading up President Channel. The T75Bs headed west near the Stuart Island shoreline until they started milling around 1550 about a quarter mile east of Turn Point. They had made a kill since T75B and T75B2 were carrying something when they passed the boat but the water clarity was not good enough today to confirm that it was a seal. After some more milling and feeding, the whales continued west toward Turn Point before rounding it and heading southeast. Dave tried to end the encounter here at 1610.
However, as “Orcinus” approached the entrance to Snug Harbor, Dave stopped and took a quick look through the binocs to see what stage the wedding was in and saw that the ceremony was still in progress.

Dave headed down to Snug Harbor and left in “Orcinus” at 1445. Taking the inside route through the islands, “Orcinus” finally arrived on scene near Lummi Rocks at 1555. The whales had been spread out in groups heading south near the Lummi Island shoreline when the encounter began. The first whales seen were T65, T125A, and T128 traveling slowly together in a tight group. T36 and the T36Bs were following about 200 yards behind them. Another group was about a quarter mile behind these two groups but they were not coming up as often. Around 1610, all the whales stopped and began milling about a half mile south of Lummi Rocks. T65, T125A, and T128 briefly joined the T36s before all the whales began heading north again.
“Orcinus” headed up to the northern group who had surfaced near the west side of Lummi Rocks and were also heading north. The whales then put on the jets and began cruising quickly north a couple hundred yards off the Lummi Island shoreline. T63 was traveling by himself but was following a group of females and juveniles by about 150 yards. This group ended up being the T46Bs and T46C2. T46B1B was not present. The T46Bs and T46C2 were covering large distances on their long dives but were not arching at all on their short dives. T63 was surfacing more regularly but he had to move fast in order to keep up with the group. T63 had a large lump on his back between his blow hole and dorsal fin that was not there at the end of March. Hopefully it is just a temporary swollen bump that will go away in time but it may be something to keep an eye on if he sticks around. A few hundred yards behind T63, the threesome of T65, T125A, and T128 were catching up but were still a few hundred yards behind. They eventually caught up but moved several hundred yards to the southwest of the other lead whales. The T36s were still somewhere behind the rest of everyone else. By about 1715, all these whales were past Village Point on Lummi Island heading north toward Alden Bank. Around this time, “Morning Star” spotted another bull who turned out to be T87 and a few other whales near the north end of Clark Island. These whales were heading south so Dave decided to head over there before they disappeared down Rosario Strait. “Orcinus” got over there by 1730 and found the T124As (minus A1 and the A2s) and the T124Ds (minus D2) traveling quickly south in a loose group along Clark Island's eastern shoreline. T87 was following this group by a few hundred yards. The T124As and T124Ds made their way past Lawrence Point and kept heading south toward Peapod Rocks. T124A3A was surfacing more often than the other whales and always looked like he was trying to keep up. The whales spread out some just north of Peapod Rocks but all passed on the east side of them. Once south of Peapod Rocks, the whales spread out even more into singles and pairs as they foraged south down Rosario Strait. The encounter ended at 1830, mid-Rosario Strait off Buoy Bay.
Reports of the T123s heading west through the San Juan Islands had been filing in all afternoon. They were now heading northwest up San Juan Channel so there was hope of catching them on the way home.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-25

He decided to make his way in that direction with hopes they were coming south.
At ~1345, as he approached Darcy Island, he got confirmation that they were slowly approaching the entrance to Active Pass. He decided to commit, so he altered to port and worked his way north up Sidney Channel and expected that he would get them as they were either working their way through the pass or more likely exiting the pass as the flood current would push them through quickly.
At 1424 he spotted a bull dorsal near Gossip Shoals amongst a large group of Bonaparte gulls at the east entrance to Active Pass.
He slowed down as he approached the area where he had seen it and, within a minute or two, spotted a pair of bull killer whales slightly north of him, which turned out to be T049A1 along with T123A. They were tight together and coming up in unison on every surfacing. When they dove, Mark scanned around for others as the original report was five animals seen from shore with only one bull.
He soon spotted a group of what looked like 5 or 6 females and juveniles a half-mile to the northwest, working their way northwest. He confirmed the rest of the T049A's less T049A2 and T049A3 and the rest of the T123's were in the group of 6. T049A2 and T049A3 often disperse from the T049As.
After a few minutes, T123, along with her nine-year-old daughter T123C broke off from the group a quarter mile to the west of the others as they continued their north west track in the Strait of Georgia.

They stopped at the Victoria fuel dock to top up on their way out of the harbour at 1025 and, while they were fuelling, received a second-hand report of a couple of eastbound killer whales seen from shore near Otter Point, slightly west of the mouth of Sooke harbour.
At 1118 they came across a group of five killer whales approaching Secretary Island traveling close to shore on a path between Possession Point and Secretary Island (48 20.2/123 43.0). There were two bulls and three cows, and Mark was quickly able to determine that it was the three members of the T101's, although this was his first encounter seeing them since the disappearance of T101's eldest son, T102, who was last seen on September 17, 2020, and was presumed dead. With Joe Zelwietro's help, Mark confirmed the other two traveling with them were the T100B's, T100B, and her 11-year-old offspring T100B1. The group of five were in a tight group making good time with the flood current along the shoreline of East Sooke Park. When they reached Bechey Head, the T100B's separated from the T101's but continued paralleling them within a quarter-mile offshore as they made their way across the mouth of Becher Bay.

He hopped in the truck to meet Joe at Mike 1 and they departed just after 1400.
As they approached Trial Island, George Hamilton called to say he had spotted the animals from his own boat as they headed southwest from the Chain Islets. Mark and Joe slowed as they exited Enterprise Channel and spotted the animals just ahead of them. They started the encounter at 1427 at 48° 24.6 N / 123° 16.8 W, and shortly confirmed the T049Bs. All four members were present and swimming in a single tight group as they moved offshore toward Staines Point at the south end of Trial Island. The group was averaging five to six minute dives and though they briefly angled toward the kelp beds along the east side of Trial, no predation was observed.

Mark felt that with them aiming towards San Juan Island, they would be in US waters close to when he would arrive on the scene with Mike 1 even if he got into motion immediately, so he called Dave to alert him of the sighting. Dave headed out his door almost immediately and had mobilized Orcinus out of Snug Harbour, San Juan Island, within 45 minutes. At ~ 1030, after Mark was relaying sighting information from George to Dave via cell phone, unfortunately, the whales had veered slightly west and were now well on the Canadian side of the border south of Kelp Reef, so Dave had to stand down. George could see that they were likely predating on something as they appeared to be milling, and he could see a fair bit of activity.
Mark mobilized Mike 1 at 1102 from departed the dock at Victoria harbour. He had arranged to pick George and his daughter Piper up out front of their waterfront home at Ten Mile Point, so after a quick pickup on the rocks, they arrived on the scene with the group of Biggs at 1150 ~ 1.5 NM SW of the Kelp Reef marker. Mark could see from a distance that this group was chasing a harbour porpoise. Mike 1 trolled in closer to get a better look at the predation and saw who turned out to be T124D knock the porpoise into the air. Within a few minutes of the group circled around the area where T124D made what appeared to be the final blow. They drowned it at 1155 (48 33.9/123 14.6). Sarah Burnaby on Kodiak had arrived on scene 30 minutes before Mike 1 arriving and had seen the predation going on when she arrived, likely what George had witnessed through binoculars from shore.
Mark confirmed seven individuals in the group; The T124A's with the T124D's, less T124D2.
The group continued northward against the ebb current after milling around and prey sharing for ~25 minutes before they started to travel northward against the ebb current as they slowly passed through the reefs between the Kelp Reef marker and Little Darcy Island. Several of them appeared to have a chunk of their prize in their mouth as they slowly made their way.
T124A3A lagged well behind the group, but T124A leading the way, would circle back to slow up the procession to allow him to keep up.
At ~ 1240, George and Mark could see more harbour porpoise ahead of the group, and almost instantly, T124D took chase of another one! This time the Mike 1 crew saw the predation event from start to finish. T124D1 appeared to be doing all the ramming of the harbour porpoise and put it out of its misery in short order. The start of the chase was observed at 1241 and the drowning within ~ 12 minutes later at 1253 (48 33.9/123 14.6).
After prey sharing their second harbour porpoise in the past hour, T124A pulled away, which appeared to be with purpose, well to the northwest towards the southeast corner of Sidney Island while the others meandered along in her path and shared the last of their most recent prize.
Mike 1 decided to make their way up to T124A to confirm that she wouldn't meet other Bigg's associates that may have been rendezvousing with them.
With no sign of any other individuals on the horizon, Mike 1 ended the encounter at 1327.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-21

Dave headed to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1725. “Orcinus” got out into Mitchel Bay and quickly saw a young male killer whale about a half mile off Smugglers Cove and the encounter started at 1730. He was traveling north slowly and not arching. After he went on a long dive and came up a little further north, Dave was able to catch up and identify him as T65A2. He was being a real low rider and was not showing his saddle at all. Dave finally saw the other whales way up ahead approaching Kellett Bluff. The whales near Kellett Bluff had gone on a long dive by the time “Orcinus” got there and then Dave saw another group about a quarter mile offshore paralleling them. The whales near Kellett came up again and these three whales were T77, T77E, and T65A4 traveling together in a loose group. When they went on a long dive, Dave moved offshore to the outside group. This was T65A, T65A3, T65A5, and T65A6 and they were traveling north rather quickly in a tight group. This group kept moving ever closer to the border so, after getting some good ID shots, Dave moved back inshore for one more pass with T77, T77E, and T65A4. These three looked like they might be angling toward the rest of the T65As who looked, from a distance, like they were heading more northwesterly now. T65A2 was several hundred yards to the southeast of the threesome. T65A2 was still traveling slowly by himself in a more northerly direction toward Stuart Island.

T77A and T49A2 were acting pretty relaxed and there was a little rolling around going on between them. T49A2 did two aerial scans. They passed through Spring Passage and picked up a little speed as they pointed toward Green Point on the east tip of Spieden Island. Both of them went on a long dive and came up heading east back toward Jones Island. T77A and T49A2 then traveled southeast along the shoreline on the west side of Jones Island.

J57 and J58 were enjoying themselves while playing with one another. The skies were sunny with some clouds for most of the day but there was a big rain squall covering up the sun when we were with J pod.

The cloud just made things darker and we had about a 10 degree window that we had to put the whales in to get a decent shot at all.

Those whales were now milling off Lime Kiln and were last seen pointed back north. T87 was also reported to be in the mix. T87 is one of the oldest male killer whales on the coast with an estimated age of 59. He was first known from Southeast Alaska in the 1980s where he still spends part of his summers and he started becoming a regular off-season visitor to the Salish Sea in the early 2000s. Dave first encountered him nearly thirty years ago in the winter of 1992 near Race Rocks. T87 has become a well-known whale up and down the coast and it is always good to see him. Dave was heading out the door to CWR anyway so he left quickly and decided to drive the west side in case the whales headed south. The day was gray but the water from Hannah Heights to Lime Kiln actually looked fairly calm despite wind being in the forecast. Dave didn’t see anything as he drove the west side so he headed to CWR with the hopes that the whales continued north. After driving down to the house to look from the porch, Dave spotted the whales pretty much immediately after finally getting his binoculars to focus about a mile offshore but firmly on the US side of the border. Dave headed to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1015.
As soon as Dave got out into Mitchell Bay, he got a call on the radio from Tom Cogan who had the whales in sight. Andrews Bay was not nearly as calm as the waters to the south and Dave bounced his way toward where Tom was pointing him. The whales were soon spotted and the encounter began at 1025 about a mile offshore of CWR. The whales had not gone anywhere and it was obvious that they were feeding as they milled on the north part of a large slick that ran to the south. Lots of gulls circled overhead looking for scraps while Dave bounced around in the trough of 2-3 footers waiting for the whales to pick a direction. It was the T90s with T87-T90 being T87’s probable younger sister. The group finally started moving north after about 15 minutes of milling and feeding with T87 and T90B in the lead. These two were rolling around together some. T90 and T90D were slightly behind these two but were catching up. T90C briefly disappeared and may have stayed behind to continue feeding. By the time the whales had made it to Smugglers Cove, T90C had caught up to the others and she traveled with T90 and T90D while T87 and T90D were loosely spread to the inside of them. The whales picked up speed as they headed north toward Open Bay. When the whales reached the mouth of Open Bay, they slowed down and grouped up tightly abreast of one other. The whales then went on long dive that had to be at least ten minutes long before finally coming up along the rocks of the southwest tip of Kellett Bluff. They then headed north along the shoreline of Henry Island and passed between Battleship Island and McCracken Point. T87 and the T90s turned east into Spieden Channel and picked up speed again. The skies got a bit darker and the breeze was picking up so the encounter ended at 1202 off the west entrance to Roche Harbor.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-17

We got on scene at about 1300 with J pod still in a resting formation near the San Juan Island shoreline a couple miles northwest of Point Caution. The encounter began at 1303. At 1315, we went in for a quick photo-ID pass. J pod was still resting and not arching so we let them pass us by while we got proof of presence photos and then pulled way off to let them wake up. By the time J pod had made it to Rocky Bay about a half hour later, a lead group had moved ahead of the others by a little bit and this appeared to be the J19s and J36. The whales looked like they were beginning to wake up by the time they made it to Reuben Tarte and a part of J pod gave the onlookers there a nice pass by. By this time, the rest of the J16s had also split from the main group and looked like they were foraging on the Jones Island side of the channel.
The bulk of J pod traveled slowly west into Spieden Channel with a lot of rolling and tactile behavior. The J19s and J36 rejoined the large group while J16, J26, and J42 caught up to the rest by the time they had made it to about mid-Spieden Channel. The whales became more active as they approached Center Reef with several tail lobs and a couple of big, high spyhops before spreading out as they headed west into Haro Strait. Most of the J35s took the more northerly inshore route while others began foraging west of Danger Shoal. Another large group appeared to still be socializing. J35 foraged by herself near the western tip of Spieden Island while J44, J47, J53, and J57 rolled around and played with one another a few hundred yards to the south of her. We then moved back offshore and to the west to the large socializing group that included the J31s, J37s, J41s, J40, and J46. This group was rolling around and tactile. J26 was following this group before he passed behind us and headed offshore. J39 was also in the general area. The large tactile group broke up some and we followed a small group that consisted of the J37s, J40, and J46 as they began moving quickly northwest about a quarter mile off the Stuart Island shoreline. As this group moved closer to Turn Point, the J31s rejoined them and now the J35s were paralleling the group while closer to the Stuart Island shoreline. Nearing Turn Point, the J35s joined the offshore group and all these whales turned west and toward us. We shut off the engine and then the whales began milling all around/under/beside the boat for a couple minutes while we sat there. J57 rolled around on his mom’s back right off our stern before J35 did a slow turn and a slower glide right along side us with J57 in tow. J35 had had a similar relaxed attitude around the research boat when J47 was young and she had also brought him over to introduce him years ago. J38 appeared again and he and J47 were socializing together off Turn Point. The whales began moving off to the west-northwest in the direction of Moresby Island. There was still a lot of milling going on as the whales spread out and we ended the encounter at 1625 about a half mile off Turn Point.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-16

He ran down to the deck of the main house with the spotting scope and began scanning for fins. “J2” came in to view at this time and headed to a spot where the whales should have been. Sure enough, dorsal fins soon appeared way out in the middle of Haro Strait in line with Johnstone Reef and looking like they were just over the Canadian side of the line. It was a large loose group that looked like it could very well be J pod coming across the strait. The whales were too far away with just enough haze to be able to identify them. Dave headed back up to the ID office and got on the radio with Jeff on “J2” and found out that the whales were a large group of transients including the T10s and T63-a popular whale known around here as “Chainsaw” due to two large nicks in his dorsal fin. Dave then called Katie and they met at Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1310.
As we headed out of Mitchell Bay, “J2” informed us the whales had crossed the border and were heading north. Perfect. We soon saw the whales and the encounter began at 1329 off CWR-just barely on the US side of the border. The whales were still heading quickly north toward Henry Island in loosely spread groups. Our first pass was a semi-backlit one with a lot of whales coming up at once. We saw some hints of the T49As and T71s as they passed. “Chainsaw” is also easy to pick out of a crowd. He seemed to be in a group that included several young males slightly behind the others. By the time we got to the good light side, the groups began splitting up and many whales started traveling quickly toward Open Bay. Most of the T71s and a few others took a more northwesterly route perilously close to the border so we decided to go for the whales safely on the US side. Those whales were well on their way to Henry Island and, due to a breeze and their speed, were leaving us in the dust. T71C left whatever whales he (?) had been with and crossed our bow on the way back to the T71s. We then got a good pass on the T10s and T65 who were trailing the other groups heading toward Henry. There was a nasty tidal chop near Kellett Bluff so we decided to go around it and try to catch up to the lead group who were plastered to the rocks near north Kellett.
About twenty minutes later, we were starting to make an approach on the lead group of females and offspring as they neared Battleship Island when they went on a long dive and came up spread out and pointed back south. They then went on another long dive and pulled a vanishing act. We putted toward other whales who had also spread out while keeping an eye out for the group we hadn’t gotten a good look at yet. T49A1 passed us heading quickly north in the direction the lead group of whales had originally been traveling before they began milling. We had one more quick pass with the T10s, T63, and T65 while they traveled north-northwest near the border before heading off to look for the lead group again. We eventually found them at 1445 off the west end of Spieden Island. This was the T36As and the T49As (minus T49A2 and T49A3 who were not present today) in a tight group. T49A1 had joined them and they had finally slowed down as they traveled past the entrance to Reid Harbor and along the Stuart Island shoreline. We ended the encounter at 1503 about a half mile southeast of Tiptop Hill on Stuart Island. Once we got home and looked at our photos we realized that T68B1 and T68B1A were also mixed in with the T71s. These two brought the total number of whales photographed this day to 21 from the T10, T36A, T49A, T65, T68B1, and T71 groups.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-15

After waiting a bit for confirmation that whales were heading for San Juan Island, Dave met Katie at Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1210. As we neared Bellevue Point, we saw our first blows on the shoreline just north of Lime Kiln. We began the encounter at 1224 but we waited off Bellevue Pt. for the whales to continue north. Except they didn’t. In a tight group, the whales milled back and forth along a small section of shoreline between Lime Kiln and Bellevue Pt. Through binocs, and Katie taking dot shots with her longer lense, we could see that it was the J16s (minus J26) and the J19s together on the shoreline-despite a rising wind and a swell rolling out of the southwest. At about 1240, J16 and J42 split from the group and headed west. The others also eventually came offshore and milled a bit before heading back down island.

We decided to go around these whales and head down island to try and find some other whales. The water got sloppier the further down island we went but we found J26 by himself heading slowly up island off Edwards Point maybe a few hundred yards off the shoreline. Several hundred yards behind him we saw another whale we thought might be J45 but it disappeared before it could be photographed. Near Hannah Heights we saw a group of three animals that turned out to be the J31s and J40. They traveled slowly up island in sloppy seas. After getting shots of these three, we headed back north to find more whales and calmer seas. We eventually found those calmer seas and a small group of whales at least a mile off the County Park. This was J19, J36, J51, and J58 and they traveled slowly north in Andrews Bay. Another whale we figured was J41 was foraging by herself about a half mile up ahead. J36 and the rest of the J19s eventually split up some and began foraging in Andrews Bay too. We hung on the periphery well away from any whales and hoped other whales would come up from the south. No more whales seemed to be coming though so we finally ended the encounter at 1533 with the J19s and J36 being spread out off CWR.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-14

He confirmed at least four individuals with a newish calf but felt there could be others in the area as his instinct was that he was looking at fish eaters as they appeared to be foraging along the current line.
Mark picked Brian up in James Bay on his way to mobilize Mike 1, and the two of them departed Victoria harbor at 0842. Mark had contacted Gordon Rowles to reacquire them from his 23rd-floor perch after Brian had left the lookout at Beacon Hill. Gord had recently seen them pass south of Trial Island, and it appeared they were making their way towards Discovery Island before they disappeared from his line of sight.
The Mike 1 crew stopped for a scan when they were off the southern tip of the Victoria Golf course, and Mark re-sighted them through his binoculars in the Oak Bay Flats north eastbound for Discovery Island. The encounter started at 0908 at 48 24.5/123 15.9.
As Mike 1 got abeam of them, Mark confirmed that they were the J17’s. Fish eaters, as Brian had suspected! The J17’s were last seen two days prior westbound in Race Passage but must have decided to turn back rather than connect with the rest of J pod, which had headed west out the Juan de Fuca 24 hours ahead of them. 
The family of six were traveling in a tight group as they crossed the Oak Bay Flats and then sped up and spread out slightly as they approached Seabird Point, Discovery Island. J35 and her calf J57 led the charge past the steller sea lion haulout at Brinn Rock, and a few minutes later, it was apparent that J35 caught a fish (48 25.9/123 12.4).
Mike 1 trolled over towards their footprints moments after a gull made an attempt to grab a scrap left behind, and Brian poised with the dip net stared down into the water also with hopes to scoop a fish scrap but unfortunately also came up empty. 
The J17’s came back together in a tight group a few minutes later as they continued north across Haro Strait on a line slightly north of Limekiln Lighthouse, San Juan Island.
Mike 1 ended the encounter at 0953 ~ 1NM SW of Beaumont Shoals (48 26.3/123 12.2).",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-13

He made his way towards town to mobilized Mike 1 and departed the harbor at 1430 as he received a recent report of them passing the Ogden Point breakwater from the harbor patrol.
As Mark passed by Brotchie Ledge he saw a recent slick and could smell predation. He confirmed that it was the two brothers, T049A2 and T049A3, east bound along the shoreline in front of Beacon Hill Park. They were spotted east bound in Race Passage the day before and then turned back to the west, last seen in Becher Bay.
He started the encounter at 1441 as they slipped past the shoreline in front of Beacon Hill and could see that they were still packing the remains of a likely seal as they continued eastbound.
For the next hour Mark watched the pair move swiftly along the shoreline of Victoria’s waterfront as they treated many shore based viewers looking down below their feet as they cruised by. It looked as though they got another seal in the shallows in Gonzales Bay but barely skipped a stride as they continued along towards Oak Bay.
At 1545 Mark received a report from Evan on Kodiak that he had spotted 4 killer whales east bound on the east side of Constance Bank so Mark ended the encounter with T049A2 and T049A3 at 1554 as they meandered through the reefs of Oak Bay on a line for the Chain Islets.

Enc Summary Sequence #2:
Mark arrived with the killer whales reported east bound at the east edge of Constance Bank as Evan on Kodiak was departing at 1613 ~ 5NM south of Trial Island (48 19.4/123 17.7). Mark was able to quickly confirm that it was T002B traveling with T060C and within 300 meters to the south was T060, T060F, and her newest calf, now almost 2 years old, T060G. They were moving quickly ENE on a line for Middle Bank.

Sure enough, he immediately spotted a group of 4 or 5 females and juveniles with an obvious new calf upon arrival at the hilltop. They were within a mile of shore heading towards Trial Island. Mark hustled back to the truck and arranged to meet Joe at Mike 1. They departed Victoria harbour at 1045.
Mark picked up the faint scent of a fresh predation as they passed Staines Point at the south end of Trial Island moments before his friend and colleague, George Hamilton, fishing in Oak Bay radioed to report the animals moving north into Baynes Channel. Mark and Joe turned north and passed through a large oil slick and detected a second strong-smelling predation just south of Great Chain Island. They shortly caught up to the whales as they charged into a building ebb current in Baynes and began the encounter at 1116 (48 26.4/123 15.7). The whales were mid-channel and being pushed north while facing east with the strong current. The crew on Mike 1 counted five animals, but George called again to say there was a straggler around 300 meters from the group. The main group was quickly identified as members of the 124A matriline, including a new calf! The little one was travelling alongside the 11-year old T124A4, and would be her first offspring! The T124A group is quite prolific, the matriarch having given birth to six of her own offspring, three of them now with calves of their own.
The whales were somewhat hard to follow, as they zigged and zagged their way slowly east upon entering Haro Strait, presumably well-fed with long dives. Mark and Joe were able to confirm the entirety of the T124A matriline (less the dispersed T124A2s) including T124A1, who is not always with the group. The whale that had been gallivanting about alone proved to be T124A3A, who unfortunately lost his mother late last year. He has remained with his grandmother and the rest of the family, and eventually did join the group before they crossed into the United States shoulder to shoulder. Mike 1 ended the encounter at 1222 as the animals crossed the border offshore of Lime Kiln Point (48 29.1/123 10.9).

Around noon, Jane called again to say they were now hearing Southern Resident calls on the Lime Kiln hydrophone. Katie and Dave eventually met at Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1355. Mark was out on a POW boat and had briefly seen some of the J16s heading toward SJI while on his way to the transients.
Northern Haro Strait was lumpy and we bounced our way south until we saw our first whales off Deadman Bay at 1410. Since it looked like they were entering the park we decided to wait for them where we were near Bellevue Point. Except they never showed up. We drifted south a little with the ebbing tide and figured out the lead whales had turned around and were now heading down island. We putted south and found the group again off LandBank almost a half hour after we had first seen them. They were milling a little and were briefly pointed north again before continuing down island not far off the shoreline. All the J19s plus J35 and J58 were traveling together in a tight group. J57 and J58 were doing a lot of rolling and splashing and there was a half breach from one of the adults. About ten minutes later the group was joined by J47 coming from offshore. We left this group off Hannah Heights and moved down island toward Kanaka Bay and found J37 and J49 laying at the surface together. They had a salmon and were rolling and being tactile with one another while they shared their fish. The water was much calmer down here. Near the south end of False Bay, J38 foraged by himself. J22 was also in the area a little north of him. J38 started doing pec slaps and another whale appeared east of him near the shoreline. This was J45 and he headed toward J38 and joined him. These two began socializing and we soon moved on. After making sure we got a photo of J22, we headed toward Eagle Point where Katie had seen a couple of fins and found a tight group of three spending a lot of time at the surface. On the way to them, Katie saw a whale with kelp in its mouth. This threesome was J16, J26, and J42 and they were pointed up island and moving very slowly with some rolling around with one another. J26 surfaced with kelp draped over his back.
We moved back up island and found a group of four traveling down island in a tight group at the south end of False Bay. This was J36, J40, J46, and J53 and they moved quickly southeast until they stalled out and began milling off Eagle Point. We kept moving back up island and found the J35s again traveling slowly up island in a tight group. The J19s were in a tight group about a hundred and fifty yards to the northwest of the J35s.

Mark received a message from Jane Cogan at 0610 the following morning that she heard faint SRKW calls on her private hydrophone.
At 745, Mark spotted a breach south of Great Chain Island from his living room window and confirmed with binoculars a bull killer whale on its second breach along with others quickly westbound in the Oak Bay Flats.
Mark got a hold of Joe to get in gear, and they left Victoria harbour on Mike 1 at 0840.
They saw their first whales ~ one nautical mile east of the VH buoy on the Victoria waterfront still plowing quickly west through the building seas. The encounter began at 0852 at 48 22.5/123 20.7, with L55 leading the charge. The whales were spread both north and south of her; L105 was the next whale seen, traveling near L72 and L123. The seas were 3' and with 25 knots of headwind, it made for challenging photo identification.
Mike 1 continued to slog its way west, tracking the animals as they made their way towards distant flatter water in the lee of Parry Bay between Albert Head and William Head.
The next pair of whales that Mark and Joe spotted simultaneously was L86 and her new calf, L125! They were racing quickly westward, and L125 appeared to have no trouble keeping up with his/her porpoising mother. The pair joined up with L55, L90, and several members of the L47 matriline just as L72 and L105 also arrived.
By this point, both Mark and Joe were fairly confident that only the sub-group of L's that they and Dave had encountered with the J's and K's two days prior (see Encounter #08) were present. Sure enough, reports of J's and K's heading south in San Juan Channel a few minutes later confirmed their suspicion.
The western whales shortly slowed down and spread out as they neared Parry Bay, and William Head and the Mike 1 crew were able to add L82 and L87 to their census for the day. The animals picked up the pace once more as they passed Pedder Bay and powered into the 6' seas in Race Pass as they rocketed west with the building ebb current.
Mark and Joe ended the encounter at 1103 at 48 18.5/123 32.2 and put their stern to the huge seas while they watched the last of the L's clear the Pass and head out the Juan de Fuca Strait.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-9

Dave then called Katie so she could get ready for a potential encounter. Also, Dave’s car was still stuck in his driveway due to piled icy snow from last weekend’s snowy weather. So, if any encounter was going to happen, Dave needed a ride. Mark later called to say he and Joe were heading out on the Canadian side. A little before 0900, Jane reported that she had spread out whales trickling by their place. Dave called Katie again and she came and picked him up and they headed to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 0945.
We got word from the SR3 drone team that the trailers had rounded Kellett Bluff about 30 minutes previously. It was sunny but breezy and Haro Strait was pretty lumpy but we were already out so we decided to try to catch up to the whales. We slogged our way through 2-3 footers in a boat whose deck was covered in ice and snow as we headed in the direction of Turn Point. Mark and Joe were also bouncing their way up the Canadian side of Haro Strait just a little ahead of us.
We finally saw our first whales right after Mark, who had better sighting lighting from his angle, told us they were just ahead of us. The encounter started at 1014 about a half mile south of Tiptop Hill on Stuart Island. We saw several peripheral singles and pairs and a larger group inshore. K34 was the first whale we got a good look at and he was traveling with a sprouter who turned out to be L109. We moved in toward the large which was getting larger as some of the peripheral whales joined it. This large group consisted of the bulk of J pod along with all of the L4s and L87. J27 and L87 were part of the group furthest from the boat and those two were taking long dives and not surfacing as much as the others. The J16s were the closest whales and they were doing a good job of running photographic screen for the animals on the other side of them. Due to some back lighting along a dark shoreline and the J16s constantly coming up perfectly in the way of everyone else, it was hard to get an idea of who all exactly was in the group. Oh, and did we mention that we had choppy seas and a boat with a deck covered in ice? We were seeing young calves but it was hard to tell who the mothers were as saddles disappeared behind swells. We were convinced that both J57 and J58 were present but-who was that other calf? We finally got a decent look at it and its mother and it was definitely a new calf coming up next to L86. The calf had a much larger left eyepatch than both J57 and J58. J57 and J58 actually looked larger than the third calf and they are both going through a stage that all young calves go through when their skin has a very mottled appearance. You could still see fetal folds on the new calf and it had a closed saddle with a small finger on the left side. The new calf had filled out some and we estimate its age to be between a month and a month and a half old. L106 was also in close attendance with his mom and new sibling. Interestingly, it was J44 and J47 who were closest to the L86s but they seemed like they may have been more interested in L106 than the new calf. The whales filed past Turn Point around 1055 and entered an even chunkier tide rip in the intersection of Haro Strait and Boundary Pass. L86 and her new calf L125 disappeared in the slop and we ended the encounter at 1013 right near the border with a tight, rolling group consisting of J46, J53, J56, J57, and J58. The whales kept heading north toward Swanson Channel and Mark and Joe continued on the Sequence 2 part of the encounter.

EncSummary:
Mark and Joe hit the water in Victoria just after 0900 to join Dave in north Haro Strait with a large group of Southern Resident killer whales that had initially been heard on hydrophones around dawn. They travelled north in Haro Strait until they spotted many scattered, small blows along the Stuart Island shoreline and to the south. As Dave was arriving on scene, Mark and Joe decided to slog their way north through some uncomfortable seas, hoping for lee while they waited for the northbound whales to cross into Canadian waters. They found some calm seas to the northwest of Turn Point and waited for some action. All of the animals were moving quickly and whether they chose to go north or east from Turn Point, they would soon be nearing Canadian shores.
The first animals to reach Swanson Channel were J38 and J22 and Mark and Joe began their encounter sequence at 1018 at 48 39.9/123 15.6. They were steaming north at a good pace, along with J39 and a couple of the K13s, K20 and K44. More animals were spread east toward the Pender Bluffs, so Mark and Joe picked their way carefully that way.
A large group quickly arrived from the south, slightly offshore, so the Mike 1 crew zigged that way. This group turned out to be a mix of Js and most of the L55s! The five L55s that were most recently encountered by researchers in January in Johnstone Strait - and later that week seen from shore heading southwest from Hannah Heights, San Juan Island - have apparently rejoined the rest of the 18 Ls (and L87) that they are more often associated with. The group milled in place for a few moments, before also turning north. Letting these animals pass, Mark and Joe were next met by a group of five Js and Ls, also northbound tight together. J38 and L105 towered next to J47, L115 and L118. As Mike 1 maneuvered inshore to stay clear of the group, Mark spotted what they had been hoping for…L106 and L86 alongside the newest Southern Resident L125! The trio was working north along the beach, and eventually met the rest just meters off Mouat Point, North Pender Island. All then surged north for Active Pass, dazzling many shore base viewers as they went. Mike 1 ended the encounter at 1335 (48 48.4/123 19.7) and made way for Victoria.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-8

They were heading north into Baynes Channel so Mark called Joe to mobilize Mike 1 and pick him up on the rocks in front of his apartment rather than waste time by going home to grab his gear and then drive back downtown to the boat. Like a well-oiled machine, Joe arrived with Mike 1 at the shoreline in Oak Bay and they were on their way at 1401. Within seven minutes of departure they started the encounter within a quarter mile north of Ten Mile Point light.
Upon arrival they could see that they just missed a kill as the two individuals were milling about in a large sweet-smelling slick amongst scavenging gulls (48 27.4/123 15.7). As Mike 1 eased into the area to confirm their identity, Joe was slightly quicker than Mark to confirm that it was the two brothers T060D and T060E. He second guessed himself for a moment as he saw in the back of his camera his distant photo showed a second notch in who he thought was T060E’s fin. It did turn out to be him, now with a new notch half way down the trailing edge just below his known notch.
The pair had finished up their snack upon Mike 1’s arrival and were working their way along the shoreline of Ten Mile Point before they zagged slightly offshore on a line toward Zero Rock.
This pair, often quite elusive and difficult to photograph well, were very cooperative this time perhaps because they were especially well fed on the Oak Bay seals. Mark and Joe were able to get decent left- and right-side pictures of them early on in the encounter and then shadow them for the duration as they tracked towards Zero Rock. Disappointing to the Mike 1 crew, the whales calmly continued on past the reef at Zero Rock without making any predation attempt on one of the numerous seals wallowing in the shallows. Mike 1 ended the encounter here (48 31.6/123 17.5) at 1507.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-7

He could not confirm a direction of travel as the whales were moving either directly toward or away from him, and still several miles off, but was able to count at least five or six animals and at least one bull. As he raced home to collect his gear he called Joe who made a pit stop at Clover Point to confirm that the animals were just a quarter mile off the Point and moving steadily eastward before continuing to town. They met at Mike 1 and departed the harbour at 1201.
With some direction from shore-spotter extraordinaire, Gord Rowles, they were able to catch up with the group of Bigg’s as they traversed the Oak Bay Flats. The encounter began at 1214 (48 24.4/123 16.2) as the whales were travelling quickly east for Sea Bird Point, and dove in a tight group as the boat slowed on approach. When they surfaced, the two bulls instantly gave away the T085 matriline, and the matriarch surfaced shortly just ahead of them alongside her youngest, T085D. Mark and Joe encountered these whales as they entered the Salish Sea on January 19th of this year, see Encounter #04 for more details.
Today, the four members of the T085 matriline (T085C was once again absent) were accompanied by two others, though both appeared young to be forming their own group; sure enough, after some time Joe was able to identify the pair as T077C and T077D. The two were reported away from the rest of the T077 matriline in the summer of 2019 at 13 and 10 years old respectively, but were observed back with the group in December 2019 (CWR Encounter #102, 2019). Mark and Joe recently encountered T077 and her youngest travelling with members of the T064B and T075C matrilines in late December 2020 (CWR Encounter #73, 2020).
The whales zigged offshore and swiftly nabbed something under a large bait ball. None of the predation was observed, but a large group of gulls and cormorants frantically took to the air and an oil slick was clearly seen and smelled at the surface. When the whales did eventually surface a few minutes later, T085A was approximately 400 meters south of the lead group. That group turned offshore to rejoin him before they all meandered east for a few breaths before an abrupt change of direction to travel quickly north. The reason soon became clear when a lone harbour seal head popped up in the wake of several of the animals. T085A, bringing up the rear, made quick work of the prey. One powerful swipe and it was not seen again (48 24.4/123 12.9)! The animals that had been ahead turned around and met T085A for some prey sharing, which lasted for the next 20 minutes. Several scraps were observed by both gulls and the Mike 1 crew as the whales moved on to the north, now entering Haro Strait. The light now on their quarter, Mark and Joe collected a single sequence of left-side identification photos before concluding the encounter at 1314 (48 26.6/123 12.9) and heading for home. The six whales were still moving north into Haro Strait and in a tight group when they were last seen.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-6

John Durban called to say they were out on their research boat “Helen” with some K13s (or at least K34) northeast of D’Arcy Island and were just barely on the American side. It was sounding like SRs had come down Haro Strait mostly on the Canadian side. Mark and Joe had headed out in “Mike 1” to get photos of the whales on the Canadian side of the border. With hope that a few whales would be still be on the American side of the border, Dave grabbed his gear, headed to Snug Harbor, and left in the boat at 1425. Once he was out into Mitchell Bay, he gave the SR3 Drone team a call on the radio to see if there were any whales that the US researchers could get to. They soon replied back that they had a few spread out whales south of Lime Kiln. Excellent. As Dave started to head south, he got a call on the radio from Tom Cogan saying they were seeing a pleasure boat with maybe something out in the direction of Baynes Channel. Dave pointed offshore a bit and began heading that way. The pleasure boat had vanished but a male killer whale came up right in the direction “Orcinus” was heading. This was J27 and he was traveling slowly south about a mile west of the County Park and the encounter began there at 1450.
After J27 went down for a long dive, Dave headed down island to find some other whales. “Orcinus” went around “Helen” flying a drone over J39 off Land Bank while he was chasing a salmon (he caught the fish) to see if any whales were south of him. Further southeast, Dave saw what appeared to be a logging whale but, as he got closer, it turned into a “logging whale log”. There was a lot of logs and driftwood floating around and Dave did a number “Orcinus’s” port trim tab after he hit a large one while heading in the direction of a blow heard. That whale turned out to be J39 and he was moving southeast off the south end of False Bay. Since he was not seeing any whales south of J39, Dave headed back up island to find a whale that “Helen” said they thought was J22 as they watched her chase and catch a salmon. A whale appeared off Kanaka Bay and it was indeed J22 and she was still milling and foraging in that area. “Helen” then reported that they had J31, J56, and J46 off Hannah Heights so those were the next whales to go too. They were in a loose group heading southeast toward Kanaka Bay. J46 and J56 came together and milled briefly like they may have been chasing or sharing a fish. By 1620, the light was fading but “Helen” had found one last group on their way home while Dave was photographing J31, J56, and J46. J26 and J45 were heading southeast off Hannah Heights while J27 was offshore heading southwest. J26 and J45 then took a hard right, headed southwest, and spread out. The encounter ended at 1635 about a mile off Hannah Heights with J26 as he steamed southwest and out.

EncSummary:
At ~1330 Mark received a report from Jane Cogan that she was hearing J and some K pod calls on their hydrophone. The animals were known to be in the Strait of Georgia two days prior and Mark assumed they would soon be heard or seen from shore heading south in Haro Strait. Shortly after Jane’s initial acoustic detection she confirmed they were south bound near Darcy Island and most of the group was well on the Canadian side so Mark and Joe got into motion.
They departed Victoria harbour on Mike 1 at 1440 and made their way north through Oak Bay and Baynes Channel. He had confirmation from John Durban, who had recently arrived on scene, that the bulk of the animals were trending south and still on the Canadian side. As Mike 1 exited Baynes Channel eastbound, Mark confirmed with Dave over the VHF that J27 was along off the San Juan County Park, and J39 was not far away. Several other animals were well south and west, and as Mark put the radio down he spotted the first dorsal fin just ahead.
They slowed and began the encounter at 1506 (48 28.3/123 13.2)). J37 was the first whale they encountered, and she was apparently the farthest southwest. Nearby, the J41s surfaced and after a few breaths were joined by J49 and J40. J37 caught up and the group zig-zagged their way south-southwest in the moderate ebb current toward Sea Bird Point at the south end of Discovery Island.
Moments after the J14s and 41s surfaced from a long dive, a small group consisting of K20 and K27 with her son K44 raced onto the scene from a few hundred meters north. J36 and the J19s were alongside these Ks and another 400 meters north of them were several others, also coming quickly south. These whales proved to be J35 and her youngsters J47 and J57. All of the animals all converged just west-southwest of the VD buoy at Beaumont Shoals and milled socially for a minute before they all slipped under the surface for an extended dive.
When the animals surfaced, they were in two groups approximately 200 meters apart, and J36 and K20 had moved off to the northeast and some distant whales. Those two were not sighted for the remainder of the encounter. The eastern of the two groups now left with Mike 1 consisted of the J14s (less J45) and J35 with her young. To the west were the J19s with K27 and K44. All of these animals were milling at the surface, seemingly undecided on a direction, though the ebb current continued to pull them southwest. After several sequences of this behaviour the animals all suddenly turned west and picked up the pace. Mark and Joe paced them for a few minutes but were eventually left behind and ended their encounter at 1633 (48 24.3/123 12.4) as most of the J14s, the J35s, the J19s, and K27 with K44 steamed west at about 8 knots, loosely spread south of Sea Bird Point.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-5

The animals were apparently working their way east across Constance Bank so Mark and Joe quickly got in gear and departed the harbour on Mike 1 at 1040.
They aimed southeast of Trial Island and before long picked up two distinct male dorsal fins on the horizon, along with a couple more blows between them. They slowed and began the encounter at 1059 (48 22.8/123 17.1). From a distance, based on the group composition and time of year, Mark and Joe had hopes that the animals would be the T085s. As they approached the southernmost killer whale, they were able to confirm T085A! While rare in the Salish Sea, when the T085s do make an appearance it tends to be around mid-late January.
The animals were spread in a loose north-south line, travelling ESE. T085A was the first whale encountered; the 29-year-old bull was roughly .5 nautical mile south of T085 and her youngest, T085D. These two were travelling close together but difficult to confirm as they zig-zagged E to SE and were taking as few as three breaths before a five- or six-minute dive. After collecting identification shots of them, the Mike 1 team moved on to confirm T085B, the second mature bull in the group. He was another half mile north of the pair, but had a lot more south in his stride and eventually met his mother and younger sibling as all four animals reached the border northeast of the ODAS buoy. All of the whales, including a lone T085A still well south of the rest, continued east as Mark and Joe ended the encounter at 1210 (48 21.3/123 10.8)). On their way out of Victoria they had spotted several feeding humpbacks very near the harbour mouth, so headed that way hoping to identify some southbound migrants on their way to warmer waters and the breeding season.
T085C was not present during the encounter, nor was she present when CWR last encountered the T085 group in early 2019. At 15 or 16 years old it is possible that she has dispersed from the matriline.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-4

He and Joe had planned to head out on Mike 1 at 1100, as the sea conditions in the Juan de Fuca Strait west of Race Rocks looked good for a search, so they got in motion.
They left Victoria harbour at 1110 and worked south on a line slightly east of Race Rocks. They came across a possible old oil slick from a kill slightly east of Race Passage, but with no sightings after a good binocular scan from them and from Gord with Big Eyes from his 23rd-floor perch, they continued west for Race Passage. As Joe trolled slowly through Race Passage as they scanned in all directions, Mark went to the stern of Mike 1 to have a final look behind them.
They both felt that with the tail end of the flood current that the whales would have made it this far by now. Sure enough! At 1151 a bull and a female or juvenile surfaced less than a quarter-mile off their starboard quarter along the shoreline of Bentinck Island (48 18.3/123 32.8). Mark hollered to Joe, ""Killer whales!"" and had him do a 180. They trolled back to the northeast in the confused seas from the strong current and moderate east winds until they had a re-sight of a group of 4 individuals northeast bound exiting Race Passage and heading toward a bait ball.
Joe was the first to confirm that it was the T060 group less T060's second and third eldest sons, T060D and E. These two have intermittently dispersed from the family since August of 2019, around the same time T060G was born.
It appeared that they found a seal amongst the bait ball and prey shared as they slowly traveled north towards Pedder Bay. They were doing very long dives, upwards of 9 minutes, while they searched for another meal. They found one offshore of Pedder Bay (48 20.7/123 29.2). After making short work of likely another seal, the whales continued north before turning east offshore of Parry Bay and taking a line for Constance Bank. They picked up the pace to nearly 7 knots for a few minutes as they continued their eastern track before slowing down and milling as if they were waiting for another prey item to come to the surface for air. Mark and Joe ended the encounter here at 1318 (48 20.2/123 26.0) as the animals decided to abandon this possible hunt and continue traveling with a slight change of direction to the northeast.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-3
2021,2021-01-06,1,2,11:30:00,02:11:00,-33540s (~-9.32 hours),Mike 1,"Mark Malleson, Joe Zelwietro","J, K",NA,Victoria waterfront,48.3699989318848,-123.406669616699,48.3650016784668,-123.471664428711,"Mark received a call from Joe Zelwietro at 1028 that he was looking at several eastbound killer whales from shore, in the vicinity of Constance Bank. They mobilized and departed the harbor on Mike 1 at 1120. By the time they reached Ogden Point, the whales had flipped around to face west and blows could be seen spread from the Victoria pilot station to Constance Bank. The encounter began a few hundred meters west of the “VH” buoy at 1130 (48 22.2/123 24.4).
Two of the first whales encountered were J38 and K44, travelling side-by-side and confirming suspicions that the animals were Southern Residents. At the same time, there was an outbound container ship in the pilot station that apparently annoyed Mark and Joe more than it did the whales, as they cruised calmly alongside for a few minutes before it outpaced them and headed for sea. J40 was identified in a small group of females and juveniles which also included J41, J51 and J58. J37 and her youngster J49 were just apart from them with J31, J46 and J44. At least two of the J16s, the matriarch and J42, were just beyond them to the west. There were a few others in the area, but the animals were only together briefly before splitting into pairs and foraging.
Well to the south of this initial pocket of animals were two bulls, one grown and one sprouting, so Mark and Joe proceeded that way, looking for more of the whales that had been present for recent Southern Resident encounters. These animals proved very difficult to approach due to the strong ebb current and long foraging dives. Eventually the pair surfaced roughly one nautical mile offshore of William Head; it was J27 and K34 working a current line, though no obvious predation was observed. At this point, the whales were spread several miles north and east, but nothing obvious was south of them. Mark and Joe decided to work slowly back to the north and Victoria, opportunistically collecting IDs along the way. Many of the whales they came across were now ENE bound moving out from Parry Bay and Albert Head toward Victoria or Clover Point, though occasional chases were still being observed. Mark photographed J22, J36 and J37 in a tight group to the southeast of Albert Head before Mike 1 moved inshore to again find J16, now joined by J26. The two were actively chasing fish and appeared to catch at least one (and possibly a second) but the boat was not close enough for her crew to notice scales in the water or any other proof of predation.
As J16 and J26 dove aiming east, they ended the encounter at 1411 (48 21.9/123 28.3) and after briefly identifying a pair of westbound humpbacks, headed for home. The bulk of the killer whales that they had encountered were still visible as Mike 1 approached the harbor entrance, and all were still spread out, foraging and trending east within a couple miles of the Ogden Point breakwater. Between them, Mark and Joe managed to confirm many of the 34 animals from the previous few weeks; representatives from each matriline of J pod and the K14s were present. K38 was the only individual from the K13’s confirmed; however, the whales were well spread and with the long foraging dives it is likely that the rest of the K13’s and K14’s were around - at one point, J26 was timed at over eight minutes on one of his trips below the surface!",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-2

The weather was not great as it was breezy with rain squalls in the area but the whales were close so Dave decided to give it a shot. After grabbing his camera and warm cloths, Dave headed to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1020.
As he putted out of the harbor, Dave debated the wisdom of going out since was it now raining with a big black cloud hanging over Kellett Bluff and Haro Strait was lumpy and white cappy. It looked pretty dark and wet out there if the whales had gone up Haro Strait. As the boat neared the mouth of Open Bay, Dave was looking hard through rain covered glasses deep into Open Bay in case the whales went in there when he got a big whiff of blubber oil on the wind. Dave then looked south and saw a large, obvious oil slick in the choppy seas about a quarter mile south of the mouth of Open Bay. The whales had obviously made a kill and were hopefully still close by. Sure enough, a fin soon appeared at the northwest edge of the slick and then a few more popped up with it. The encounter began at 1026. The four whales were milling and feeding while the sun peeked out a little and a rainbow appeared. The whales were being friendly while they fed but were not coming up for good ID shots at first. The sprouter looked like he might be T60D but then Dave saw that he had a nick so it must be someone else. This was not a group that Dave was familiar with although he had an idea who it might be-he just needed a better look at the mom. At 1032, all four whales went on a long dive and disappeared from the area they were feeding in. After a long five minutes, Dave got out the binocs and started scanning and eventually spotted a fin deep in Open Bay. The whales had appeared to be hunting again when they were in Open Bay. By the time the boat got there, the whales had grouped up and were heading back out of Open Bay in a tight group. The group was pointed southwest when they went on a long dive at the mouth of Open Bay.
Dave got a good enough shot of the mom to convince him that he had the T167s. T167A had sprouted since the last pictures Dave had looked at of him. The T167s have shown up a few times in the last several years (Mark just saw them on December 31, 2020) although they are not a common group in our area and Dave hadn’t had a chance to see them yet. Dave had seen T167 herself several times back in the late 1990s up in Southeast Alaska when she still used to travel with T165 and T166.
After another six minute plus long dive, the whales showed up again in a tight group about a quarter mile west of the south end of Kellett Bluff. The whales began milling and feeding again with lots of gulls overhead trying to get a scrap. There is a good chance that the T167s made their kill in Open Bay and carried it out before feeding on it. The whales milled, fed, and rolled around for more than twenty minutes before they went on another lengthy long dive. When they came up again, they were traveling north in a tight group toward Kellett Bluff. The encounter ended at 1125 with the whales heading north near the northern Kellett Bluff shoreline.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2021encounters/2021-1

It has become increasingly common to find humpbacks throughout the Salish Sea in winter months, to the point that they are now seen every month of the year.

While photo-identifying the individual, shore-spotting colleague Gord Rowles sighted a single male dorsal fin to the south of Constance Bank. Mark and Joe easily locked on to the animal in mirror-like seas as they neared the area. He was surfacing unpredictably, showing three different headings before diving for approximately eight minutes. When the animal reappeared Mark quickly recognized him as T227 (formerly U039), an outer-coastal wanderer that he has encountered every few years since the mid-2000s. The elusive bull was foraging for the duration of the encounter, but no predation was observed.

Earlier, on approach to T227, a group of animals had been spotted southeast of him travelling east. Though no obvious interaction was observed, T227 appeared to have been shadowing them before pausing to forage; he had been observed doing this with another group on November 11th as well, the last time he was encountered. Mark and Joe departed T227 at 1358 in search of these animals.

The group had continued east, and Mike 1 caught up with them well east of T227, still travelling quickly. They were identified as the T073A and T167 matrilines, two families of four that are far more common in SE Alaska than the coastal waters of BC and Washington. The T167s in fact have only been observed in BC coastal waters five times ever! The encounter was short but sweet, as the animals were moving quickly in a tight formation. After collecting a sequence each of left- and right-side identification photos, Mark and Joe left the animals still eastbound aiming at a distant Smith or Whidbey Island.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-75

They travelled southwest to Race Passage and encountered three humpbacks in Becher Bay, foraging lazily side by side by side. They shortly departed the humpbacks and travelled southwest out of the bay, angling offshore in the direction of Pillar Point. Mark soon spotted a sliver of black on the horizon ahead of them and slowed as two distinct dorsal fins appeared again. They began the encounter at 1320 (48 17.8/123 42.4).

The two killer whales were travelling west-southwest in the Strait at about four knots. They were quickly identified as some rarely encountered outer-coastal Bigg's, T233 and her presumed first offspring, T233A, approximately three years old. After a few sequences of slow meandering travel, the animals hastened the pace, reaching 7-8 knots and travelling in a precise line. Mark and Joe moved away from the whales a few hundred meters and began scanning farther west and south, wondering if the hastened travel meant that others were in the area.

No other whales were observed, and the encounter ended at 1419 (48 16.6/123 50.9) as the two whales crossed into the United States, continuing quickly on their WSW trajectory. No predation was observed.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-74

As they were leaving the dock in Victoria harbour at ~1250 they received a report that there were Bigg's killer whales exiting Port Angeles harbour. This made three days in a row that killer whales were spotted there. It was reported that members of the T064's were present, and it was believed to be them seen on December 27th as well. No members of the T064 group had ever been confirmed in the waters of the Salish Sea, and Mark had only encountered them once in southeast Alaska during a Fisheries and Oceans survey during the winter of 2009.
Christopher Hanke on Saratoga/ Puget Sound Express out of Port Townsend came across the reported Port Angeles killer whales at 1335 off of Ediz Hook and reported to Mark that they had exited Port Angeles harbor and was heading north for Race Rocks. Mike 1 continued SW towards Victor Golf after stopping to identify a humpback whale ~ 1 nm NW of the Victor Hotel buoy. Christopher gave Mark the last position of the Bigg's as they were leaving them at 1416 (48 10.1/123 26.6) and mentioned that they hadn't been able to confirm their identity but staff member Bart Rulon, photographer/naturalist, was in the process of flipping through the catalog with hopes to confirm.
Mark and Joe spotted the group at 1507, traveling north towards them ~ 2 NM southwest of Victor Golf.
They were able to identify T064B, T064B1 and a younger one assumed and later confirmed to be T064B2. Joe also confirmed the T075C's and thought possibly the T075B's as well until they heard back from Saratoga that Bart had confirmed T077, which was who Joe had initially thought could have been T075B. T077 was with her youngest calf, T077E, but no other of her offspring were present, making this group a total of 7 individuals.
Within a few minutes of the start of the encounter at 1518, the group had stalled out and had grabbed what looked like a seal at 48 15.0/123 28.8, and prey shared for a few minutes before making a direction change to the west.
Mike 1 stayed with the group for close to another 40 minutes making sure they had decent left and right side shots of the group, especially the newest addition to the T064B's, T064B2, which was not in the latest Fisheries and Oceans catalog. The encounter ended at 1559 ~.5 NM southeast of the Victor Foxtrot buoy (48 13.9/123) as the whales started to track to the southwest.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-73

As Mark turned, a tight group of roughly ten animals appeared halfway between the bull and the boat, so they began the encounter at 1345 (48 19.8/123 17.4)
Even from a distance the sharp, roughed-up dorsal fins gave away the group as a motely crew of Bigg’s killer whales! The group was comprised of T036, her daughter T036B and her own youngsters, T075B and hers, T137 and a couple of oddballs, T036A1 and T037A1. T037A1 has been travelling with the T036 and T137 group in recent weeks, both in Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, though T036A1 joining them was news to Mark and Joe. They wondered if perhaps others were around, though none were seen. They spent just two sequences with the group, enough to identify all eleven animals present and assess the behaviour given their proximity to the incoming J and K pod whales. Several changes of direction were observed, but the no predation occurred and the whales seemed more indifferent than anything else as they lazily moved east.
The male was still surfacing south-southwest of the group, but making way for them. Mark and Joe had a hunch as to his identity, and as they approached were able to confirm it was indeed T137A. T137B and T137D have departed their natal group for the moment, travelling with the T035A and T038A group since late September of this year, and were not present in today’s encounter.
They ended the encounter at 1355 (48 19.4/123 17.0) with the whales moving slowly east, but not with great intention. After a final scan south for any others, the Mike 1 crew made way for Victoria.

Based on the previous day, both Gord and Mark assumed residents, and Mark casually got in gear for another encounter. He met Joe downtown and they departed Victoria at 1200. The whales were well south of Victoria, still offshore of William Head and Parry Bay, and in similar fashion to the previous day, were well spread and foraging. The encounter started at 1215 (48 20.5/123 24.7). J19 was the first animal they observed, followed soon after by J38. J41 and 58 were foraging together near K20, the first K pod whale sighted for the day. Others soon followed, though once again the animals were multi-directional and would disappear for minutes at a time.
After confirming each matriline of J pod, and enough Ks to assume the same composition as yesterday, Mark received a call from a shore-based contact, Brenden Kelly who had spotted a small group of killer whales tight together well ESE of the known residents and were reported to be moving quickly east. Mark estimated the group to be three or four miles east of them and it was reported to contain at least one bull. Mark and Joe had accounted for each male in J pod and the male Ks they had spotted the previous day so figured they were likely some Bigg’s slipping past the Residents. They decided to confirm, departing the Southern Residents at 1332 (48 20.8/123 21.2) still foraging and moving northeast.
Returning to Victoria from their encounter with Bigg’s killer whales southeast of Trial Island, at 1439Mark and Joe spotted the eastbound Southern Residents beginning to group up ~ 1nm south of Brotchie Ledge (48 22.9/123 21.8) as they approached Clover Point. They slowed as they approached the animals and determined that J27 and the J14s were the most inshore group, and leading the charge east. They were closely followed by the bulk of J pod, the J16s J17s J19s and J22s, while both the K13 and K14 matrilines remained slightly offshore as they also worked east. The animals were lazily socializing as they passed a few hundred meters south of Clover Point, but accelerated toward Staines Point at the south end of Trial Island. There they seemed to flush some fish off the wall there, as some chasing and exuberant breaches were observed as they moved into Oak Bay and pointed at Baynes Channel. It’s not unheard of for SRKW to take that route in and out of Haro Strait, but they far more regularly opt to pass south of Sea Bird Point, off Discovery Island. However, the whales picked up the pace here reaching six or seven knots, so Mark shut down the boat and they watched the whales cruise into the Oak Bay sunset. Both of J pod’s newest additions, J57 and J58, were looking quite well bouncing around with the rest of their kin. The encounter ended at 1555 (48 23.6/123 17.7) with all of the animals pushing north for Baynes Channel.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-71

After a week of stormy weather in the south Vancouver Island-Juan de Fuca region, he was ready to pounce! Mark had Joe Zelwietro meet him at Mike 1 and they departed the harbour at 1035. Initially spotted near Pedder Bay, NE of Race Rocks, Gord reported the whales as northeast bound for the Victoria waterfront. After stopping five minutes out of the harbour to photograph a westbound humpback, Mark spotted a single bull foraging his way north in the distance. They slowly made their way to him, the low winter sun illuminating more blows to the south and west. The encounter began at 1048 (48 20.0/123 25.1) with J27 working northward for the VH buoy. From there, Mark and Joe began carefully working through the spread out members of J pod. They next encountered J19 and J39 a few hundred meters ENE foraging solo. The whales seemed to be working as far east as a line south from the VH buoy before turning right around and heading back for Albert Head. No obvious success was observed, but several chases were, and there was certainly something keeping the animals on the spot! As far as Mark and Joe could ascertain, the spread was roughly two nautical miles north-south, and at least a mile and a half east-west. They spent a few minutes tracking J38 and J22, and then a quite playful J37 and young J49, who rolling on top of one another and vocalizing quite audibly at the surface. They eventually carried on, jetting off to the east in a blur.
After an hour of picking their way through only a handful of whales, they considered ending the encounter and hoping for more cooperative behaviour tomorrow. The whales were doing long foraging dives and members of each matriline but the J16s had been identified, including both late summer additions J57 and J58. Back toward Parry Bay was a pocket of three or four animals working some fish, well south of the main aggregation. Hoping for the missing whales the Mike 1 crew looped south and after an extended dive from what proved to be J16 and J42, there were suddenly six to seven animals converging just 200 m west of the shut-down vessel. Within moments it became apparent that all of the J pod animals were coming together! Patience had paid off, and Mark and Joe were pleasantly surprised to also spot K26 arriving with two others from the direction of Albert Head. No K pod whales had yet been spotted, but given the direction they were arriving from, it is possible they were foraging in Royal Roads, inshore of the Js. The animals met and milled around, briefly moving south, but shortly the 24 members of J pod split to form two distinct groups and move north, led by the J14s, J17s, J19s. The new arrivals from K pod turned out to be the nine whales comprising the K13 and K14 matrilines. They joined the lead group of Js, which now included J22 and J38, though J38 and a sprouting K42 fell back to bring up the rear. The J11s and J16s trailed by a couple hundred meters and took two or three sequences to catch up by 1415. The Mike 1 crew took advantage of the tight grouping to pick off their missing IDs before ending the encounter at 1424 (48 21.0/123 24.6), leaving the whales moving peacefully eastward but making little way.

At 1325 he received a call from George Hamilton who, while fishing in the Oak Bay Flats, reported a group of killer whales traveling fast eastbound through Enterprise Channel and turning northbound towards Baynes channel.
Mark called Joe to have him go to the rocks in front of his apartment where he would pick him up allowing an immediate departure from the dock.
Mike 1 departed Victoria harbour at 1330 and with a quick pit stop to pick up Joe a couple of minutes later they re sighted the killer whales milling off of Strongtide Island at 1400 (48 26.2/123 16.4). They slowly approached a group of females and juveniles which they recognized as the animals from the December 9th encounter near Race Rocks, the T075B's and C's. There was another group with them today, the T049B's. Several members of the group all of a sudden started breaching and at one point it looked as though there was three individuals airborne at one time! This went on for a few seconds until T049B2, T075B2 and T0753 worked their way over to the inside of the reef off the south western corner of Vantreight Island. A seal had narrowly escaped them as it had half its body out of the water on the rocks in the shallows as the trio circled around the rock. T075B3 did a final pass by only to realize that the seal was out of its reach and then joined the rest of the group that was milling around at the south end of Baynes Channel. This group, still very animated, continued circling around the area for the next 45 minutes and occasionally breached and tail lobbed before it became apparent that they had found a likely seal to prey share. The gulls arrived for scraps as the oil slick formed. Once this group of nine Bigg's had finished their kill they pushed north against the ebb current until they got into the back eddy inside the Ten Mile Point light. Mike 1 ended the encounter at 1501 as Mark and Joe watched them work their way as a tight group northbound along the shoreline of Ten Mile Point (48 27.3/123 15.7).",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-69

Mark invited Val to join him and Joe in an attempt to relocate them. They departed Victoria harbour at 1430 and made their way towards Race Rocks.
With a maximum ebb current at Race and moderate southwest winds the seas were a bit choppy. As they approached Race Passage close to 2 hours after the 1300 sighting off of Sooke they guessed that the whales would be between 6 and 8 nm east of Sooke by now as they were swimming against a strong ebb current. This would likely put them somewhere between Becher Bay and Whirl Bay. As Mike 1 exited Race Pass at 1453 they spotted a group of killer whales approaching directly off of their bow near Whirl Bay on their last 2 surfacings before going into a long dive (48 18.3/123 33.8). It appeared they were moving quickly so Mike 1 turned around and trolled eastward until the group resurfaced a few minutes later off their port quarter. The whales passed by Mike 1's port side on a line for Race Pass and Joe immediately recognized them as the T075B's and T075C's, five individuals as reported.
The seas were relatively calm where they were but were stacked up with the strong SW wind and adverse ebb current slightly offshore. Unfortunately the whales decided to turn offshore, making it very challenging for the encounter. The Mike 1 crew was able to track them for the next 35 minutes as they worked their way to the south of Race Rocks. The seas were now ~ 6 foot and short and steep so the only hope to continue tracking the whales was if they were to cross the current line and get into the flatter water on the east side of Race Rocks which Mike 1 was forced to do. Unfortunately the whales did not and after several minutes of the crew scanning in all directions and waiting for them to reappear, Mark spotted a group of gulls circling to the south in the big seas and confirmed with binoculars the whales were under them, likely prey sharing. With no way of safely making their way back against the six feet standing waves, Mike 1 ended the encounter at 1529 (48 17.4/123 30.9) and returned to Victoria harbour.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-68

Lots of phone calls followed as more people called to make sure I knew about the report of likely southern residents and the researchers tried to make a plan. Since the whales were still in Canada and might still come down the Canadian side of Boundary Pass, we decided to wait a bit before going out. The SR3 Drone Team had gone out earlier to wait for the whales to cross the border and finally got them near Skipjack Island. Once we got the word, Dave and Katie met at Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1140.
We got on scene at 1210 as the whales headed south around Sandy Point on Waldron Island. It was J pod along with the K13s and K14s and they were in small groups and singles loosely spread at first but the groups began spreading out as they turned toward San Juan Channel. The whales were active and there were several tail lobs, pec slaps and a few breaches. We caught glimpses of most of the whales present during the first pass south of Sandy Point and then went to work going from group to group trying to make sure we got a photo of everybody present. One of the first groups we got on was an all-male group involving J38, J47, J49, K26, K34, and K42. This group was being social and tactile while doing a lot of rolling around. We then moved to the northeast and found all four of the J19s traveling together. After making sure we got good shots of J58 and the others, we looked for another group to go to. We saw a group of females to the southeast of us in the direction of Jones Island and far in the lead of the other whales. J16 and J26 passed us while we heading to the females in the lead group. The group of females included J22, J31, J37, K14, and K36 and they were briefly in a tight group before they spread out again. Several minutes later, two or three individuals began porposing toward Jones Island. They soon stopped in the same area and the whales began some intense milling. The behavior looked very much like what we have seen in the past when the whales were harassing a harbor porpoise but we never saw one. We later searched our photos for evidence of what they may have had but we couldn’t find anything and are still unsure. Perhaps they found some salmon.
We then headed back west to get some photos of J35 and J57 as they traveled slowly southeast toward our previous group of milling females. Another group consisting of J36, J40, J42, J46, and J56 were to the north of the J35s. J40 joined J35 and J57. By about 1350, several groups turned around and pointed back west but there was a lot of milling going on. We continued our search for whales we had not seen yet and came across a threesome rolling around and laying at the surface. We knew one of the three was K38 but we were only seeing melons, fin tips, and other body parts of the other two. It took a couple of minutes but the other two turned out to be J44 and J45-two of the whales we were looking for. To the northwest of them was the all-male group we had had earlier in the encounter again. The group was still mostly together having lost K34 but gained J39 and K44. K44 was one of the last whales we were still looking for. This group was milling their way southeast back down San Juan Channel. Not too far from them, another large group had come together but this one was all females and young whales. Both of the new calves were in this group that also included J35, J41, J51, J36, J40, J42, J46, and J53. All the whales were now pointed slowly southeast down San Juan Channel loosely spread in groups and singles.
We were pretty sure we had a photo of everybody but we decided we should make sure we had a proper photo of K27. By 1530, the sun was already sinking beneath the hillsides of north San Juan Island and making it pretty dark for the whales in the shadows. We headed toward a loose trailing group and had a last look at a few whales as they filed by. One female logged at the surface and blew a long, slow raspberry at us before she arched and dove. It was K27! We got some dark shots on her before ending the encounter at 1545 about a quarter mile west of Pt. Caution. While we were wrapping up the encounter, a single humpback whale passed us traveling slowly east following the Js and Ks.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-67

He had gone up on the hill with hopes that the group that Mark had the evening before or some others would be in the area. Mark had joked with him earlier in the morning that if he did spot some it would guarantee a spot on Mike 1!
They left Victoria harbour at 0950 on Mike 1 and headed towards the south west corner of Constance Bank. Within a few minutes could see a bull on the horizon and as they got closer they could see several other animals spread south for approximately 2 nm. With this large spread it appeared as though it could be Residents until they saw the unmistakable fin of T019B over a half mile away. The encounter started at 1008 (48 18.8/123 22.4) ~ 6 nm east of Race Rocks.
They decided to begin with the closest animals and work their way to the south to confirm that all the animals from the evening before were present and ensure that no new ones had joined in the 18 hours since Mark left them between Turn Point, Stuart Island and Moresby Island.
The first pair they photographed was T034A and her newish calf T034A1; they then worked what looked like T034 and T034B which they lost track of, but re-found and confirmed at the end of the encounter.
The next group of 4, a few hundred metres to the south was the 25-year old bull T019C with an 8-year old male T037B1 traveling close to T019C's older brother T019B and T037B1's grandmother, T037.
T019B and C's grandmother, T018 was slightly farther south traveling with the 13-year old sprouting male T049A2 and his younger brother T049A3. The most southerly animals were T049A2 and A3's mom T049A, and their younger siblings, T049A4 and T049A5.
Mark and Joe had seen a bull well ahead of the group to the west, likely T049A1, so they worked their way toward Race Rocks until they spotted him along with T019B and C's mom, T019.
The only one they hadn't confirmed was T037B but seeing as Mark had photographed her the evening before and she was likely overlooked in the spread they decided to end the encounter at 1154 (48 15.8/123 35.4) ~3.5 nm SSE of Beechey Head. The animals were making their way west at a steady 6 -7 knots with the outgoing ebb current and no sign of predation was observed during the entire encounter.

He left Victoria harbour at 1355 on Mike 1 and made his way in the direction of Turn Point.
At 1446 he spotted the large group of Bigg's socializing and it appeared that they may have been finishing prey sharing as a few gulls were hovering above them and one occasionally swooped down to pick up the last of the scraps as the animated group sauntered south west down Boundary Pass.
Mark spotted a pair of animals who were slightly west of the group ~1 nm south of Tilly Point on South Pender Island and started with them (48 42.8/123 12.2). Mark identified these two on the outskirts as T049A2, a 13 year old sprouting male with his 9 year old younger brother, T049A3. They were rolling over each other and entertaining themselves independent of the rest of the group during the entire encounter although the large group did eventually join up with them.

Through Big Eyes, Gord felt they were a small group of Southern Resident killer whales. With J pod reported the day before exiting Active Pass northbound into the Strait of Georgia, perhaps some K's or L's were coming in.
Mark made his way downtown and powered up Mike 1 at the entrance to Victoria harbor at 1011 and at 1016 spotted them ~1 nm south of Clover Point (48 22.8/123 20.7) headed for the southern tip of Trial Island. At first glance, Mark figured they were a group of 8 or 9 Biggs from a distance, but once he was abeam of them, he immediately could see they were Southern Resident killer whales. The lead group consisted of 3 animals, K20, K34, and K38. Less than 1/4 nm behind was another group of 6 animals, K14, K26, K27, K36, K42, and K44. With great spotting conditions and confirmation from Gord on Big Eyes, it appeared that only the nine individuals, the K13's and K14's, in the area.
Once the lead group got to Staynes Point, the southern tip of Trial Island, they turned around the corner of the island, getting out of the main ebb current, which allowed the others to catch up. The group then proceeded across the Oak Bay Flats towards Discovery Island and worked into the shoreline along the kelp line as they approached Seabird Point lighthouse. They became quite animated, as if they were flushing out salmon from the kelp bed with several tail lobs and a breach from K27. The large aggregation of Steller sea lions that have been wintering here the last few years seemed startled and extremely riled up as many of them in the water started porpoising along the shoreline as the K's approached. These stellers then grouped up, and the rest that were still hauled out on Brinn Rock anxiously watched them swim past.
From Seabird Point, the K12's and K13's worked their way northwest up the middle of Haro Strait on a line between Kelp Reef and Kellett Bluff, and Mark ended the encounter at 1243 at 48 28.6/123 12.3 (~1.5 nm NW of Beaumont Shoals).
Dave went out later in ""Orcinus"" and had a brief encounter with the K13's and K14's from 1420 to 1440 off Mitchell Bay.

At 1145 he came across J pod members working their way east on the eastern edge of Constance Bank (48 20.3/123 18.4). The seas were quite confused with a strong flood current working against the southeast swell generated from strong southeast winds several miles to the southeast. Many of the whales were taking advantage of the lively seas, with some catching a few waves and surfing back towards the west and others breaching over the tops of the swell.

Within a few minutes of scanning with a pair of 8 X 42 binoculars, he spotted some splashing well to the southwest of Constance Bank. Eventually, he confirmed the blow of a humpback whale as he was confirming that he also saw some smaller distant blows. He called his friend Gord Rowles to verify if they were killer whales with the use of Big Eyes from his 23rd-floor apartment. The active humpback had also caught his attention and was in the process of confirming the smaller blows as well!

He then saw a group of females and juveniles and soon confirmed that both the new calves, J57 and J58, were with their respective mothers, J35 and J41, along with J51. J19 was soon to join up with this group, and they moved steadily to the north. Mark then located J38, J22, and J37 milling about as a threesome slightly south of the lead group, and J27 and J39 playing with each other a little over .5nm to the south of them.
A group of three southwest bound humpbacks came barrelling past the J's, and a few members of the pod momentarily turned around and started to follow them before turning back to the north.
Mark then spotted J26 to the northwest of the group, and as he made his way in that direction, he could see the remainder of the pod was starting to gather up and rendezvous. At ~1340, the entire pod had joined up ~ 2 miles south of Victoria harbour's Ogden Point breakwater (.5 nm west of the VH buoy). After a few minutes of slow northbound travel, they all turned around and started to spread out. They worked their way back to the southwest in the direction where they were first spotted earlier in the day.

Fin and Hanna were ready to call it a day so Mark headed off solo.
With George keeping a lookout from shore, Mark came across the group feeding on a probable seal on the west side of Jemmy Jones Island west of Baynes Channel at 1509. He confirmed the T035A's and T038A's were still with T137B and T137D who had been seen several times with them in the last few months. The animated group prey shared for the next ~30 minutes before continuing on south west through Oak Bay. They passed along the shoreline of the Victoria Golf course and then cut across Enterprise Channel for the shoreline at Harling Point. At 1527 they found another seal in the rock pile at the mouth of Gonzales Bay (48 24.3/123 19.7) and frolicked around for another ~30 minutes while they prey shared. This time they drew in a few onlookers, one kayak and a couple of paddle boarders which were out for an evening paddle and were able to take in the last of the activity before the whales got back on their westward track along the shoreline of Victoria's waterfront.

Mark, Hanna, and Fin left Victoria harbour at ~1030 on Mike 1 with hopes to relocate this reported group of 4 animals, which included one bull as Gord hadn't seen them again as they disappeared in the sun glare. He figured that they had either headed southeast beyond his visual range or were going southwest away from him, so Mike 1 started the search by heading south towards Coyote Bank, crossing over the area of Constance Bank where they had initially been spotted. At 1058 they stopped to photograph a pair of westbound humpbacks on the northeast corner of Constance Bank (48 21.5/123 20.8) and, after a binocular scan, continued the south to Coyote Bank. After a good scan while at Coyote Bank, it was decided to work their way west towards Race Rocks. At ~1130, Mark spotted a bull dorsal pointed south ~1.5nm east of the Victor Golf buoy. As Mike 1 drew closer, with no other fins insight, Mark and Hanna guessed it could be T049C as he had been seen patrolling throughout the area several times over the past few weeks. When they were inside a mile from the bull, they slowed down to confirm the bull's identity with binoculars and spotted three smaller fins a half-mile to the northwest of him.
Mike 1 started the encounter at 1136 (48 16.0/123 25.4) when Mark concluded that the bull was T251 and the other 3 were the remainder of the T252's. Within a few minutes, the group came together after T252, T253, and her newish calf T253A came over to Mike 1 for a curious pass by. T253 and her calf T253A were initially quite animated as T253 did a couple of breaches, and T253A zipped around the area. No obvious predation was observed as they continued on and tracked steadily to the southwest until the group made a northwesterly turn along the tide line southwest of Race Rocks. The bull, T251, once again separated from the trio and led the charge towards the feeding birds and scattered humpback whales ~ 1.6 miles south of Church Rock. As the skies darkened and the rain started, Mike 1 ended the encounter at 1257 (48 16.8/123 35.2) as the T252's worked their way west ~ 2.5 miles south of Becher Bay.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-60

They stopped ~3 miles south of the harbour for a couple of humpbacks when Mark received a second-hand report of a single bull spotted by a fisherman at 48 20.0/123 23. This was less than 2 nm to the southwest of where they were. Likely the illusive T049C again, they trolled slowly in the direction of the report. After a few minutes of scanning in all directions, Mark figured they needed all the help they could get, so he called Gord to see if he could scan from his 23rd-floor apartment perch.
Gord eventually spotted a bull dorsal fin well to the southwest of them and was able to get Mike 1 close enough to confirm it was T049C before he gave them the slip.
Mark's friend Keith was with his family near Constance Bank on his sailboat, looking for humpback whales and had given him a call to see if any were in the area. Mark told him to head towards them to help them relocate T049C as they continued scanning the area and assured him he would at least come across humpbacks on route. When Keith was within a mile of Mike 1 he called to say he spotted a bull killer whale eastbound to the south of him. Mike 1 was able to see T049C moving quickly eastbound towards the anchored freighters at Constance Bank before he disappeared for another 30 minutes. Mark figured that they must have missed a dive sequence by him altering his track to the south into the sun glare, so they worked their way slowly in that direction. George eventually got a distant glimpse of an eastbound dorsal fin at the edge of the sun glare, and after another 30 minutes, they finally located him a mile to the north of them after overshooting him.
At 1334 he finally found something to prey upon at 48 17.6/123 21.5. Although there had been a couple of Dall's porpoise observed high tailing it out of the area moments before, there was no sign of a chase, so likely it was an unsuspecting seal that he grabbed. He milled around the area for over an hour after doing several cartwheels, several tail lobs, and a couple of incredible full breaches. He didn't leave any crumbs behind during his feasting that the Mike 1 crew could collect for analysis as the gulls would beat them to them, nor did they want to disrupt his feeding in any way. They put the net away when he finished snacking to observe the interaction between him and a humpback. The humpback had been observed earlier to the east while T049C was feeding, but it appeared that the curiosity got the better of it, and it came to check him out. The pair circled around one another for ~10 minutes before T049C proceeded westward, and Mike 1 ended the encounter at 1506 (48 17.6/123 21.6).",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-59

With long dives, many direction changes, and big distances between sequences, it was challenging to track him, but Mark was able to locate him on occasion from the sound of his exhalations due to how calm it was. Occasionally he had to differentiate T049C's exhalations from the numerous humpbacks in the area to know which way to look.
At 1229 T049C came across a likely seal at 48 19.2/123 28.3 and milled at this location for 11 minutes while he ate it. He then proceeded westward towards Race Rocks and entered the Ecological Reserve at 1305, did a big pectoral slap, and took a couple of breaths before disappearing for over 10 minutes.

On his approach, he confirmed the T123's but no sign of the T059's. He continued scanning throughout the area while he watched the T123's moving amongst the feeding birds.
At 1227 they started to move quickly northeast, and Mark could see that they had located a large Steller sea lion feeding on a fish (48 18.7/123 40.4). They went to work. T123A stayed on the peripheral while T123 and her other two offspring took turns making quick passes by the Steller.
With long breaks between these rushes, they drifted slowly northwestward with the ebb current as the taunting continued.
At 1325 Mark decided to head west as a couple of commercial whale watch boats out of Victoria were now on scene, and he had a report that killer whales were seen westbound off of Otter Point an hour earlier, likely the T059's. The steller hunt had now been going on for over an hour, and it didn't appear to be ending anytime soon.
Mark continued west as far as Jordan River, now 8 miles past the shore-based report off Otter Point an hour and a half later. He decided that they may have made it further with the help of the strong ebb current, so he turned around in the grey skies and light rain and headed back east closer to the shore with hopes that he had gone by them. The consolation prize was to return and watch the T123's finish the Steller hunt.
He arrived back on scene at 1448 and could see they were still at it 2 hours and counting, now slightly to the northwest less than a mile south of Secretary Island. At about the 3-hour mark, T123A joined in the efforts and took his fair share of rushes on the Steller.

Haro Strait was clearer than we thought it might be and we saw our first whales at 1135 off Andrews Bay. J26 was actively chasing a salmon and J47 came over to help. After a chase that lasted a couple of minutes, both J26 and J47 spread out and headed south. J49 also appeared in the area and headed down island. About a quarter mile south of these three, we saw another fish chase going on and at least two whales were there. When we got closer, we saw that it was J41, J51, and J41’s new calf J58. Both J41 and J51 were chasing the fish and J58 was right there in the middle of the action. After the chase, the threesome pointed down island and then inshore. J51 split off briefly and did several single bellyflops while he was by himself.

A Victoria-based whale-watch vessel had happened across the animals at approximately 1520 on their way home from viewing humpback whales in the Strait of Juan de Fuca (Canadian whale-watchers focus their tours on Bigg’s killer whales and humpback whales). While slowing to identify and then allow the resident killer whales to pass, the crew enlisted Mark’s help over radio to identify J41 as the female with a minutes-old calf. On the heels of the reports, Mark left Victoria harbour at 1700 in an effort to confirm the new mother/calf pair.
Turning the corner at Race Rocks, the swell was monstrous by Salish Sea standards, reaching 10 or 12 feet in some areas. The first whales were encountered south of Otter Point at 48° 19.028 N / 123° 49.621 W and southern residents were confirmed as J16 and J26 surfaced in unison. The whales were quite spread, both to the west and south, and with rain squalls passing through and swell well overhead, conditions were not ideal. From the J16s, Mike 1 shifted south to where L103 and L123 were foraging, as was a nearby K44 with another young male. There were several more L pod whales spread within a mile or so of these four, including L90, L91, L55, L83 and L122. Seeing more animals scattered toward Sheringham Point, they headed northwest to continue the search for J41 and her youngster. They ran into L105 and L106, along with J44 foraging nearby. All of the whales soon began pushing hard offshore, pointing toward Clallam Bay, in the direction of the large concentration of L pod whales the crew had just left.

As he continued west of Race Passage, he spotted a pair of humpbacks eastbound off the entrance to Becher Bay. It turned out to be a mom and calf, so after a few minutes with them, he could only get a fluke shot of the mom and continued westward.
Another stop offshore Sheringham Point lighthouse proved successful as he heard several humpback blows to the south, saw some humpback tail flukes through binoculars as they dove, and then heard a smaller blow to the north of him.

He decided to stop ~4nm SSW of Sombrio Point to drop the hydrophone for a listen as the visibility was less than a mile and was hoping to detect the Southern Residents one last time.
Just as he was about to turn the hydrophone on he heard multiple killer whale blows spread out. Once he got his bearings on the direction they were coming from he quickly pulled in the hydrophone and turned on the engines to Mike 1 to troll in their direction. He soon saw a pair of small fins at the edge of his visibility which surprisingly looked like Bigg's. He soon confirmed that he had members of the T046B's as the next pair to come into his view were T046B1 along with her newest offspring, the unmistakable leucistic T046B1B. He could see a few other members of the T046B's scattered around the area as well as a distant bull which turned out to be T046D.
The group seemed to be slowly traveling west back towards Port Renfrew until at 1404 T046B1 started to chase what turned out to be a seal. T046B1B came along her side immediately once she had the seal trapped at the surface. They both took runs at the seal as they circled it and within a few minutes the rest of T046B1's offspring arrived from the outskirts to get in on the action.
At 1429 T046B1 finally pulled the seal under and drowned it. She and her immediate family prey shared until 1501 while T046B and T046D stayed on the outskirts.
They then all headed east and spread out. Mark assumed that he would eventually spot other members of the T046's but it seemed that only T046D was present.

It was only 12 nm from Magdellena to the mouth of the Port of San Juan, so Mark calculated that they would find them between 6 and 8 nm miles west of the earlier reported position by the time they got back out to the area. The visibility was less than a mile but with them spread out it would make it easier to find them.
Mark slowed down when he got 8 miles west of the previous sighting and trolled along at 8 knots to the east. Joe and Bill were out front of the console on either side, and Mark even took the odd glance behind them as he continued on with all three of them scanning in all directions.
At 1638, when they were ~2.5 nm SSW off Sombrio Point (48 27.1/124 18.7), Mark stopped and shut off the engines and came out from behind the console to scan and listen. He said to Joe and Bill, ""They have to be here."" They both said in unison, ""They are here. We thought that is why you stopped! A bull had surfaced up ahead of them at the edge of their visibility approaching them. They soon confirmed K33 and moved slowly through the area to conclude that the animals were spread out from north to south in a line as they slowly worked their way west with brief foraging dives. The Mike 1 crew was only able to find six animals, K33, K26, L54, L88, L108, and L117. It was likely that the K12's, K14's and L54's were there in their entirety, but with the limited visibility, they were not able to confirm. Perhaps there were some others that were well ahead or behind.

They proceeded west towards Swiftsure Bank with calm seas and limited visibility.
At 0948, they came across a sea otter ~3nm south of Carmanah Creek (48 32.8 124 44.2) before continuing on to where Hanna and Mark had come across a large aggregation of humpbacks, sea lions, seabirds, and the T049A's the day before.
As they approached the area, the birdlife increased as well as large numbers of frolicking Steller sea lions as well as California sea lions.
They then spotted a large group of ~20 humpbacks tight together, preparing for an almost unison dive when Hanna shouted out ""killer whales!"" for the second day in a row. So much for collecting humpback tail flukes! Encounter 47 had begun. It seemed as though the Bigg's were harassing a small California sea lion when Hanna first spotted them, but they chose to move on. Mark immediately recognized the unmistakable T109B4 as he had an encounter with a group of Bigg's, which included this group on his way to Port Renfrew on September 9th.
Mike 1 tracked the T109B's for a lengthy time with hopes to see some predation as there was plenty of prey in the area. With less than quarter-mile visibility and long dives, it was a tall order to keep track of them. The whales seemed to be tracking between 300 and 330 degrees on the compass and averaging less than 4 knots, so Mike 1 trolled along at 4 knots and would stop and shut down every 6 minutes and listen and look. Most of the time, the whales were within their view, but a couple of times after waiting what seemed like forever, they would hear them and then troll towards them until they would reappear. This was getting old after close to 2 hours of tracking them with no signs of predation, so they were about to end the encounter at 1144 4.4 nm SSW of the mouth of the Nitinat (48 37.5 124 54.4) when Mark shouted out, ""Things are about to get interesting!"" as he watched T109B at the edge of the fog leaping out of the water in full chase after a harbour porpoise. Once she had tired out the porpoise, she took a break and let her three offspring have a go at it, likely allowing the two-year-old T109B5 practice hunting. Fifteen minutes after the start of the chase, T109B finished it off and held it down to drown. The group prey shared for the next 10 minutes before they continued their trackline for the Nitinat River bar. Mike 1 ended the encounter at 1245 as the T109B's worked their way northwest along the Vancouver Island shoreline inside the kelp beds near Tsusiat Falls (48 28.9 124 53.6).",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-47

J27 and K36 briefly came together before spreading out again. Due to heavy smoke mixing with fog, we had only about a half mile of visibility. A half mile of visibility in Haro Strait would be the best we had for the next week. We headed down to Eagle Point and found J19, J41, and K20 spread out and pointed north.

This morning was smoky and foggy unlike the perfect conditions the day before.
They made their way out of the Port of San Juan and decided to head east towards Sombrio in case the east bound southern residents from the night before were on their way back west. The conditions were not ideal with moderate north west winds and limited visibility. Mark decided that it would be worth running with the seas and listening to the hydrophone off Sombrio in case they could hear SRKW vocals. It would be easy enough to quarter their way in to the lee of the Vancouver Island shoreline and make their way west to Swiftsure Bank afterwards. The wind was forecasted to abate late morning and less wind to the west. After a quick listen on the hydrophone in less than a mile visibility they worked their way west up the VI shoreline. The conditions improved dramatically as they continued as they tacked back and forth on a line for Swiftsure Bank stopping every few miles to listen to the hydrophone. Mark then received a report that members of all 3 pods were spotted east bound west of Race Rocks which confirmed his suspicion of them continuing east during the night.
Upon reaching the east edge of Swiftsure Bank Mike 1 came across a large aggregation of humpbacks so they decided to collect some tail fluke ID shots. The first whale to give up its anonymity was a 10 year old animal that Mark documented a calf in 2010 to BCY0160 ""Heather"".
Heather is one of the pioneers of the returning humpback whales to the Salish Sea first showing up in 2003 off the waters of Victoria. Mark has documented her introducing 4 calves to these feeding grounds in the last 14 years.
At 1018 before Mark and Hanna could continue working through the aggregation of humpbacks, Hanna shouted out ""killer whales!"". In the less than 1/4 nm visibility she spotted 3 small killer whales approaching the starboard quarter of Mike 1 (48 30.9/124 49.0). Mark fired off a couple of poor angle shots while they came past the boat and disappeared. He was fairly confident that they were Bigg's but couldn't confirm which ones with the off angle shots. Without any reference on which way they were pointed Mike 1 slowly trolled in the direction that they both agreed on. After ~15 minutes of tracking south west Mark decided to work their way back towards the original sighting location. When they were almost upon the coordinates Mark spotted a pair of bulls at the edge of their visibility. It looked as though they were pointed towards them so they shut down and waited. What seemed like an eternity, a bull popped up abeam of them working its way back to the original sighting location. They eventually got confirmation of T049A1 but no sign of the other bull. In the reduced visibility it was hard to keep their bearings and every time they thought they had found the other bull it turned out to be T049A1. They decided to end the encounter and make their way towards the Nitinat River bar to get out of the fog. As they were taxiing away T049A3 and T049A4 appeared.

They headed east towards Sombrio Point and stopped for a binocular scan 2.5 miles southwest of the point before turning back west towards Swiftsure Bank. When they were ~5 miles south of the entrance to Port of San Juan, Hanna, who was scanning from outside the cabin, motioned to Mark that she had spotted a breach off to the southwest towards an outbound container ship. She figured it was likely a humpback whale, but Mark felt it was a good idea to confirm. When they were within a mile of the ship, it was obvious that there was a large group of killer whales westbound in the outbound shipping lane.
They confirmed that they had J pod in its entirety grouped up moving slowly west. Mark took advantage of the calm seas and started scanning with the binoculars while they waited for J's to resurface to see if more members of the Clan were nearby. Sure enough! He spotted a huge number of small blows a couple of miles to the west. After a couple more sequences with J's, Mike 1 proceeded to the west to confirm the others. It turned out to be two large groups of a mix of K's and L's in each, and both groups were heading east towards the J's.
The lead group of K's and L's met up with J's, and after a short greeting with visible signs of excitement, the Clan split up into three big mixed groups as the trailing eastbound group arrived.
They continued west towards Swiftsure Bank, and at 1050 when they got within 4 miles of the east edge of the bank, the Clan split up and foraged (48 32.6/124 48.1). At 1115 they came into a huge number of humpbacks with many Steller and some California sea lions and numerous seabirds (48 31.4/124 50.0).
Mark and Hanna decided to leave the whales to forage and headed back to the dock with intentions to come back out in the afternoon to photograph them in a better light. They temporarily ended the encounter at 1208 (48 30.9/124 49.8).
Mike 1 departed the dock at 1455 after stretching their legs and a lunch break.
They re-sighted the whales in almost the exact location they had left them earlier (48 31.0/123 48.4) and resumed the encounter at 1527 with J pod who were the furthest south and were generally pointed northeast. The rest of the Clan was spread to the north towards Carmanah Point.
Mike 1 slowly worked their way north through the Clan. At 1644 Mark and Hanna observed K26 actively chasing a salmon and successfully catch it (48 33.9/124 45.4). It seemed as though the majority of the bulls were closer to shore independently foraging.
Mike 1 ended the encounter at 1753 with the most inshore and lead group of L's, which included the L054's, L12's as well as the L4's. They were very animated as they proceeded in a tight group to the east less than a mile from shore between Carmanah and Walbran Creek (48 34.2/124 41.3).",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-44

After breakfast, Dave drove down to the lookout over South Beach to look from shore. Unfortunately, there was a very heavy haze and not much could be seen although the water was calm. Blows could not be heard due to the engine noise of an extremely large number of sport fishing boats strewn from South Beach to Eagle Point. Dave then drove up the west side to CWR where it was clearer and decided to go on a search anyway just in case the whales were down south in the haze.
Dave left Snug Harbor in “Orcinus” around 0900 and headed down SJI Island and offshore on a trajectory toward Hein Bank. While east of Middle Bank, Dave received a report from a UBC boat of the T18s several miles west of False Bay heading towards SJI. Since there was still hope of finding residents, Dave kept heading south in search of them. The SR3 drone team were also out and looking for the SRs and we coordinated our search with their boat “Helen” being several miles to the east of “Orcinus”. By late morning, lots of boats were out searching and it was becoming apparent that the SRs had gone back out again in the night. When sitting between two large bait/bird balls couldn’t even raise a minke, Dave finally gave up and headed east toward “Helen” who were also giving up the search. We met up somewhere north of Eastern Bank and had a pleasant chat while lamenting the lack of SRs. We did see two female/calf pairs of harbor porpoise while we were floating around.
Dave finally started heading home and, since the last two days had used up more fuel than expected, decided to brave the Roche Harbor fuel dock on Labor Day weekend.

When the inbound whales were inside of Race Rocks, we gathered our stuff up and Dave, Katie, and Sarah Bahan met down at Snug Harbor and left in “Orcinus” a little after 1400. Ken and Lodie left in “Chimo” about a half hour later. Mark was already out in “Mike 1” getting shots of the whales while they were in Canadian waters. The whales were all the way down near Coyote Bank and we had to take the long way around the border to get there. We finally arrived on scene around 1530 right near the border on Coyote Bank. The whales were spread out in groups and singles and most whales seemed to be milling. The trailing group of inbound whales were still on the Canadian side of the border and had not yet joined the leaders and J pod whales. We first made our way toward a socializing group that included the J19s, J39, K27, L22, and L94. J27 and K34 were about a hundred yards to the side of them. K20 and K38 were also in the area. While we were working this group, we got a call over the radio from “Kestrel” saying that it looked like J35 had had her calf. We left the group and headed about a quarter mile northeast of the other whales to where the J35s were. J35 had indeed had her calf! It had not been there on the morning of September 3rd. Its’ dorsal fin was not flopped over so the calf was probably born somewhere between the evenings of the 3rd and 4th. J35, the new calf J57, and J47 were non-directional and made a big circle before slipping back over the Canadian border. We decided to give them some peace and quiet and went to find other whales. The nice group we had earlier had added L121 but they were also straddling the border and were being non-directional. We had a couple other whales porpoise past us from the south but they quickly headed into Canada. Most of the whales had moved to the Canadian side of the border at this point as they finally began heading slowly northeast again. We also had a pass by from a tight and extremely slow moving group that included K22, K27, K20, and K38 but they also headed toward the border. “Chimo” had arrived a while ago so, in an effort to spread things out a bit, “Orcinus” headed a little over a mile or so to the south of the fleet where we could see a few individuals firmly on the American side.
The first of these was K37 and he was steaming along about a half mile behind a recently separated K12 and L89. K12 slowed down and may have been waiting for K37 but we moved on up ahead to L89. L89 was also cruising at a steady pace as he headed north in a straight line toward San Juan Island. He breached once for us nicely. By this time, most of the incoming whales were back on the American side of the border as they crossed Haro Strait. We left L89 to see who else we could find to the north of him. We passed up K20 and K38 again before finding a threesome of J44, J46, and J53 as they traveled fast toward False Bay in a tight group. K34 was also in the area and we caught a glimpse of L90 to the north of us. We moved over to K34 as he cruised toward SJI while K20 and K38 slowly angled toward him and soon joined up. “Chimo” was on a large, socializing group of Js, a few Ks, and the L47s so we moved around them at a distance to try to get to L90 on the other side of them. There was lots of rolling and splashing going on in the large social group as we passed. There were also lots of spyhops along with other body parts in the air and we saw one quadruple spyhop! But we stayed spread out and went on to L90 who continues to have a very stiff swimming motion at the moment.

There were whales already on the SJI shoreline by this point and we heard that the K14s were among them so we headed north toward Hannah Heights. There we did find some whales we had not seen yet. We got a brief look at the L82s, L103s, and K26 as well as J27 and J39 again. After that we also had the J31s and L86s pass us heading up island. Behind them was a group socializing just south of Hannah Heights. This was K21, K44, L109, L113, and L118 and they doing a lot of rolling and splashing while not really going anywhere. K33 and K16 also showed up near this group. We then moved offshore to some singles and groups out there. We passed up J26 on our way to another pair of males rolling around together but this ended up being J27 and K26 again. We got a few pictures of them as they moved back south down Haro Strait before finding another small group offshore. J16, J36, L77, and L124 looked like they were chasing a salmon together. L72, L105, L108, L119, and J39 were also in the area. We ended the evening with a social threesome of J36, L108, and L119 who would log at the surface together before getting all wiggly and splashy. They took off porpoising once to the southeast before stopping, logging at the surface, and then getting all wiggly again.

At ~1100, the L12's and a few K pod members appeared to be the lead group moving quickly eastbound in the direction of Eastern Bank, over 20nm away where the J's were reported to be foraging. The rest of the K's and L's were over 3 nm behind them, spread out, and moving slow.
As Mark was taxiing out of Victoria harbour on Mike 1, he asked an American whale watch colleague if the J's were showing any sign of acoustic detection for the lead inbound group as he felt they would have been well within the range to hear them as he was leaving Victoria harbour on Mike 1. J's had come back into the inside waters on September 1st and were last reported still foraging at the bottom end of Hein Bank. Sure enough, they had recently grouped up and started to quickly travel west towards Coyote Bank. They were reported to be moving quickly and closing in on the U.S./Canada border, so Mark headed off to the south to see if he could track down the lead group of L12's and portion of K's before they met up with the whale watch fleet and J pod. 
 
As Mark was passing south of Trial Island, he got word that the whale watch fleet saw the incoming group approaching at the southeast corner of Coyote Bank. 
 Mark decided to turn and head for the trailing main concentration of K's and L's, which were now slightly southwest of Race Rocks still spread out and moving slowly east. He started the encounter at 1405 when he came across K21 eastbound leading the procession 1nm south of Race Rocks (48 17.0/123 30.8). There were a few groups that were quite animated and were generally pointed northeast towards Constance Bank.
 
At 1532 the K14's and the K12's which were the lead group and slightly south of the rest, picked up the pace and started porpoising in the direction of the J's, L12's, and K14's which were socializing on Coyote Bank ~8nm to the southeast. For close to a minute, they were doing 15 knots over the bottom! Mark had heard that some of the J's had started heading west and had crossed the border, so he broke off and intercepted them before they met up with the incoming clan members.
 At 1547 he came across J22, J38, J37, and J40 at 48 17.5/123 15.5 slowly westbound towards the incoming fellow clan members, which appeared in the distance within 10 minutes of Mike 1 arriving.

The 4 J pod members broke off and met up with different animals as they came together. More J's trickled past Mike 1 as Mark sat and listened to surface vocals and watched them socialize at the west edge of Coyote Bank.
The bulk of the clan made their way towards Middle Bank and had started to group up on the Canadian side of the border. L85 and L25 were leading the charge for San Juan Island, and Mark ended the encounter at 1757 (48 24.2/123 09.3) as he could see that it wouldn't be long before the majority of the clan were in U.S. waters and Ken and Dave could work through them and get any ID shots that Mark had missed.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-40-1

Katie and Dave then met at Snug Harbor and left in the boat around 0920. We saw our first whales off Pile Point and the encounter began at 0943. J19 was foraging offshore by herself while J37 and J49 chased a salmon to the southeast of her. To the south of the J37s, we found J46, J53, and J56 milling and rolling around together. About a quarter mile west of this group, we found another threesome rolling around together. This was J44, J47, and J51 and they, along with all the other whales we were seeing in the distance, were generally heading south. Offshore of the playful trio we saw J35 and J41 both traveling slowly south by themselves. Further offshore and south of the last whales we found J38 and J22 spread out and foraging. These two soon came together and turned back north toward San Juan Island. We then moved way inshore where J26 was slowly heading up island between Eagle Point and the south end of False Bay. J26 did a couple of belly flops, a half breach, and then a full breach (which we both missed) as he travelled northwest. He then took a hard left and chased a salmon before heading offshore. J16 was logging and splashing at the surface by herself just south of False Bay. We then moved back offshore and found J27 foraging by himself. Back inshore of him, J44. J47, and J51 were still rolling around together as they headed back north. To the south of them, a large, active, and tightly packed group was bringing up the rear. This was over half of J pod together and the group included J37, J49, J40, J45, J16, J36, J42, J31, J56, J46, J53, and J22. We had a quick pass with this group before ending the encounter at about 1250 offshore and a little south of Hannah Heights with all the whales pointed up island.
Ken went out later for sequence two but didn't get there in time before J pod crossed the border north of Turn Point.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-39

Apparently, J pod had snuck in during the night and had been lost in the fog at the south end of Haro Strait for most of the morning. Dave headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat around noon. “Orcinus” arrived on scene at about 1220 and soon got on some whales about 3/4s of a mile off Pile Point. J16, J19, J36, J37, and J49 briefly formed up in a tight group heading slowly down island. J49 was being very active and did several half breaches. Two other females were spread out inshore of this group. A few minutes later, J26 showed up out of nowhere and began chasing a salmon. The group broke up and began milling in the same area. J42 showed up, logged at the surface, and then rolled over to do a pec slap while blowing a raspberry.
About a half mile to the southeast of these whales, J39 was cruising north by himself. Further east and inshore of J39, J38 was chasing a salmon. J22 showed up, breached twice and then headed southeast. To the north and inshore of the J22s, J27 was heading slowly up island near Kanaka Bay before he turned abruptly and headed offshore. J35, J45 and others were foraging in a tide rip right off Pile Point. Several of the young J17s were in the area as well as the J31s and J42. J53 and J56 spent some time playing together. As these whales approached Hannah Heights, Dave went offshore to briefly see J39 again before deciding to head north to find some of the leaders. A loose group of 4-5 whales were found off the County Park and this was the J41s, J37, and J40. Dave left this group as they were passing CWR and went back south and offshore to try to get a better shot of J22. Dave arrived in the right area only to discover that J22 and J38 had gone on a long dive and came up way inshore and heading south off Bellevue Point. Eventually, J38 arched nicely and gave a good right side shot but J22 was inshore of him and Dave gave up on them as they approached Lime Kiln. The encounter would have ended there but there was still a group of whales between here and home. A tight group of the J19s, J35s, J40, and J45 were now heading south past CWR tight to the shoreline. The encounter ended there at 1540. All members of J pod were present and photographed. There was lots of foraging and fish chasing on the west side today so let’s hope the whales are finding plenty to eat.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-38

With limited visibility they zigzagged their way out to Swiftsure Bank with hydrophone stops along the way.
At 1016 they came across 3 humpbacks at 48 30.3/124 50.8. They could hear a lot more in the area to no surprise as this was the hot spot for life the past 5 days. For the next 2 hours they moved slowly through the area getting opportunistic humpback fluke ID's as they continued listening and looking for killer whales in the less than 1nm visibility.
The wind was starting to come up from the southeast with moderate seas so the Mike 1 crew took a tack to the southeast as far as the Juliet Alpha buoy (48 29.6/124 43.6). They then quartered their way towards the Vancouver Island shoreline to get some lee and perhaps get lucky with some Bigg's along the shoreline. They found flat water once they got within a quarter-mile of the VI shoreline and worked their way southeast, starting at Walbran Creek.
The world-famous West Coast Trail is spectacular, especially when you can view it without carrying a large backpack on your back so Mark decided to find a nice protected bay to duck in and get the crew to shore for a lunch break. The came across the perfect spot, Cullite Cove (48 33.9/124 35.9), and put a stern anchor out and took a line to shore keeping Mike 1 out far enough to not get beached. After the crew took a quick break and were able to stretch their legs on this beautiful section of the trail they got back on the boat, pulled anchor and trolled out of the bay. At 1507 before they exited the bay Mark yelled out ""killer whale!"" as a bull dorsal fin came up in the kelp on their port side. Joe then spotted a female and immediately knew it was the T010's, mother and son. Mike 1 followed along with the north westbound pair for close to 30 minutes before Mark received a text from Pete Zelen on the Pacific Scout, the Victoria Pilot boat which was westbound near the mouth of the Port of San Juan at that time on their way to Cape Beale. They had passed by a group of westbound Southern Resident killer whales spread out in the fog at 1440.
Mike 1 ended the encounter at 1535 (48 33.7/124 37.9) as the T010's were approaching Walbran Creek cruising the kelp line northwest.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-48

“Orcinus” arrived on scene at 1320 as the whales were traveling northwest along the Stuart Island shoreline under Tiptop Hill. The three whales were T65A2, T137A, and T137B and they were taking 6-7 minute long dives as they headed slowly up the Stuart Island shoreline. They milled briefly in the little cove just south of Turn Point before moving on. The trio split at Turn Point with T137A turning east while T65A2 and T137B continued north toward Swanson Channel for one series of surfacings. Then, after another lengthy long dive, all three came up together about a mile north of Turn Point. They milled in the same area for two series of surfacings before turning north toward the Pender Bluffs and crossing the border.

Dave headed over to CWR to grab some gear only to find that Andrews Bay was fogged in. He then drove down the west side to see if it had cleared up any down there. It was looking pretty thick until about Hannah Heights and Dave almost gave up and went home. However, Katie had sent a couple more texts and said that the T10s had made it up to the flagpole at American Camp and it was still clear where they were. Dave then headed back toward Snug Harbor as the fog was noticeably clearing on the west side and finally left in the boat at 1320.

“Orcinus” arrived on scene at 1345 off False Bay. T10 and T10C were foraging way inshore off the entrance to False Bay. They went deep into Kanaka Bay (a place where T13 and T14 were held captive for a period of time in 1976) and looked like they made a kill on a probable harbor seal. The pair came back out of the cove acting like they were feeding. There were a couple of tail lobs out of both of them and T10C breached three times. The T10s then angled offshore right before they got to Hannah Heights and began heading west-southwest. They stopped and milled near a kelp mat like they had another seal but it was unclear whether they another kill. The T10s then turned northwest and the encounter ended at 1535 mid-Haro Strait as they neared the Canadian border off of Land Bank.
Dave had wanted to see the T10s because it had been thirty years ago that he had first seen T10. He did not realize until digging out old slides from 1990 the next morning that the encounter with the T10s on August 11th was thirty years to the day that Dave first saw T10!

The boat needed fuel so we had to make a stop at Roche Harbor to top off before we got going. We saw our first whales off the north end of False Bay at 1550. Some of the L47s were very spread out foraging as they pointed north near Kanaka Bay. L47 did a belly flop. We moved south to find other whales and found L83 with L110 in the same general area. L110 chased a salmon just south of False Bay.
There was a large gap between the L83s and the next whale. We eventually found a whale off South Beach plunging east toward Salmon Bank. By the time we caught up to the single female, we were on the north part of Salmon Bank. The whale turned out to be L90, one of the whales we could not find the day before. L90 was moving quickly east and was not surfacing regularly so it made it hard to get good shots of her. Her appearance was rather stiff and rigid so there is a chance she may be pregnant again.
All the other whales except for the L47s and L90 had earlier headed north through Cattle Pass and up San Juan Channel. We made it to the Ks and other Ls around 1740 while they were near the south side of Shaw Island. The whales appeared to be in three groups and were in the middle of a turn-a-round. The first group to move south back past us was L87, L82, and L116 with L106 behind them. Most of the L55s were to the east of L87 and the L82s and we could only get proof of presence shots on them.
The K16s, L72s, and K21 were the farthest west whales as they headed south in a loose group past Danger Rock. K16 did two belly flops. We stayed with this group as they traveled slowly down San Juan Channel until we ended the encounter at 1845 off Fisherman Bay.

Our colleague, Jared Towers, had encountered a few K pod whales and a little over half of L pod in Johnstone Strait two days earlier and they had arrived down here more or less when we expected them to. We arrived on scene with the leaders about a quarter mile north of the west entrance to Prevost Harbor at 1705.
L105 was the first whale we saw and a couple others were on the Stuart Island shoreline heading west toward Turn Point. Others, like the K16s and the L82s, were loosely spread behind the leaders and a larger group was reported to be behind these whales. L105 did several half breaches as he moved inshore towards the leaders and members of the K16s and L82s also did several taillobs along with a couple of cartwheels and breaches along the shoreline. L82 gave us a big spyhop too. The leaders rounded Turn Point at 1730 and began to spread out more as they headed quickly south in Haro Strait. The larger group also rounded Turn Point a little afterwards and this was the bulk of the L4s and L47s. L87 was also nearby.
Sub-adult males L106 and L110 were playing and rolling with each other as they broke off from the larger group. All the whales fanned out across the American side of Haro Strait as they headed rapidly south. There were a few pairs and briefly a couple of threesomes but the whales were very spread out. By the time we made it to Battleship Island, we received word that the leaders were already south of Smugglers Cove and out of reach. We were able to find everyone who should have been there that evening except for L72 and L90 but we could have easily missed them with how spread out the whales were.

The encounter started at 1515 when we saw our first whales about 3/4s of a mile south of Hannah Heights. This was J35 and J47 and they were pointed toward the San Juan Island shoreline while spread out and foraging. To the south of them, J37, J16, J26, J42, and J49 were spread out and traveling down island off False Bay. J45 and J53 were offshore of these whales foraging individually. The J16s and J37s briefly came together south of False Bay before splitting up again. J42 and J49 stayed together a little longer and were socializing with J49 doing a lot of splashing and rolling. He spyhopped once and then floated vertically in the water with just the tip of his snout showing for about twenty seconds before spyhopping again and rolling over to show how excited he was to be playing with J42.
We moved on to a male foraging by himself another half mile offshore. This was J27 and he was taking very long, long dives and only coming up for two or three breaths before going on a long dive again so we got a proof of presence shot of him and went back inshore to find someone else. J39 was traveling up island by himself off Eagle Point. J31 and J56 were ahead and inshore of J39 just south of False Bay. J40 and J46 were also in the same area and J44 was foraging by himself a little south of them. We left these whales off the south end of False Bay around 1855 to head north to find the whales we had not seen yet which were the J19s, J22s and J36. We saw J45 again off Hannah Heights and then there was a big gap in whales until offshore of the County park where a few members of the J16s were. There were other whales off Snug Harbor and nearing Kellett Bluff so we passed up the whales in Andrews Bay and headed for the leaders rounding Kellett.

While those four were occupied, T46D traveled and foraged by himself at least 3/4s of a mile to the south of them. Dave last saw T46D heading off in the direction of Deadman Island as he approached Cattle Pass. T46 and her other three offspring had begun traveling south a bit more directionally in a tight group. The encounter ended at 1330 while the group of four were pointing south-southeast as they neared Whale Rock.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-30

Mark and Hanna headed for town to mobilize Mike 1 but found that the ignition keys were missing due to a thief's tampering with the boat.
They loaded their gear into the truck and headed to Oak Bay to mobilize Eagle Dancer. With the ~ 1 hour delay, the trail was getting cold as they departed Cadboro Bay at 1348 and headed southwest for Trial Island.
Mark had called Gord Rowles earlier to let him know of Jasper's sighting to have him keep a lookout from his perch on the 23rd floor near Beacon Hill. As Mark and Hanna were stopped scanning southwest of Trial Island, they received a VHF call from Gord that he had seen a bull dorsal fin on the horizon through his Big Eyes to the south of Discovery Island.
They worked their way east a few miles before spotting a group of 4 or 5 females and juveniles following a pair of bulls traveling southeast.
Mark recognized them as the T060's along with T002B, who he had confirmed the day before by a colleague's photos. Chris Bain and Lewis Freeman came across them at 1613, traveling north in Sidney Channel while transiting through on a commercial tug, and they were later reported by Simon Pidcock at the mouth of Cowichan at 1813.
Mark and Hanna's encounter began at 1422 as they watched the two bulls, T060C and T060D, join the others after ~10 minutes and turn to the southwest to face the building flood current.

As Dave arrived at Snug Harbor, John sent a text saying the whales were at Danger Shoal. Dave left in the boat at about 1800 and headed through Mosquito Pass. As Dave approached the scene he was informed by John and “Spirit of Orca” (who had been with the whales while they were in Spieden Channel) that the whales were the T123s and had been evasive and were taking long dives. The whales finally came up from a very long dive heading west about three quarters of a mile south of Reid Harbor and the encounter began at 1825. The four members of the T123s angled northwest and traveled at a medium speed in a tight group. Luckily, their long dives became shorter and the whales started traveling in a straight line.

He came across T124C, who was alone and ~.25 nm to the north of the others before making his way to the main concentration of animals. There were 3 main groups comprised of females and juveniles, and it looked as though there were around 20 individuals in total. He then spotted a larger bull trailing the group, which he was able to confirm T087 through Swarovskis. The first group Mark came across was very animated, and T075C did a cartwheel followed by several breaches. Although the general track was westbound, the animals circled around Constance Bank for the following 90 minutes with continuous vocalizations. Mark was hearing surface vocals as well as clear vocals resonating through the hull of Mike 1. For the entire encounter, the two bulls, T124C and T087, socially distanced themselves and the others at close to .25nm while doing longer dives. Mike 1 ended the encounter at 1020 when Mark was confident that he got decent identification pictures of all individuals present.

There was a young adult male in the lead and at least three other blows behind him still off Lime Kiln. The leader charged north and turned out to be T101B. Once Dave got his ID shot, he slowed down to a putt to wait for the others. While waiting, Dave was on the phone with Ken to report who the whales were when T101B suddenly surfaced right beside the boat and began riding the bow. Dave turned the boat off and T101B began milling in the area right off Bellevue Point. And then T101B came back to the boat and decided to hang out right beneath it again while he waited for the others. He surfaced once on either side of the boat but went back to hanging underneath it. This went on for about a minute before T101B shot off as T102 passed.
All the whales went on a long, long dive before coming up together off the County Park. All four of the T101s then headed slowly north in Andrews Bay in a tight group. They moved inshore a little off Sunset Point but pushed about a half mile offshore once they had passed Smugglers Cove.

The distance from Active Pass to East Point is ~ 11 nm, so with the ebb current, Mark figured that they would likely be at East Point by 1030 and hoped they would make the turn and come down Boundary Pass. At ~1050, as they approached Monarch Head, he gave Hanna the helm to go outside the cabin to spot, and before he made it to the front of the console, Hanna slowed down and turned towards the shore. She had spotted T019C surface close to the Saturna Island shoreline traveling south towards Monarch Head. This was the last dive of his sequence as a few minutes went by before they spotted him or any others again. The oldest unmistakable bull T019B was slightly inshore of T019C, and the matriarch, T018, was paralleling them a half-mile offshore, but there was no sign of T019. They hoped that she was either lagging way behind or perhaps well offshore towards the middle of Boundary Pass.
As they crossed the mouth of Plumper Sound tracking for South Pender, the two bulls, T019B and T019C, joined up while T018 continued paralleling them, now within a couple of hundred meters. While continuing to scan for the missing T019, Hanna spotted a humpback whale within a quarter-mile to the west of them.

Paul was going to go out and take a look at them, which allowed Mark to finish up some work before he and Hanna would head out on Mike 1.
Paul called to let them know that the whales were eastbound after he found them and watched them prey sharing off of Sooke. Mark and Hanna left the dock at Victoria harbour at 1108 with a quick fuel stop on the way out of the harbour and headed west towards Race Rocks.
They arrived on the scene at 1154 ~1 nm south of Christopher Point. Paul departed as they arrived and reported a group of 5 animals, two cows with three juveniles, one of them within its first year.
The group was eastbound towards Race Rocks, and after the second sequence of predictable travel, they disappeared. Mark stopped the boat and rapidly scanned for several minutes with the Swarovski's and spotted them after almost accepting defeat close to a mile to the east near Race Pass slightly inshore of their previous track (48 18.2/123 32.5). They had found a prey item and were starting to prey share when Mike 1 arrived back to view who they finally determined were the T075Bs and T075Cs. Without knowing what they got, Mark and Hanna decided to pick up a small piece of skin and blubber with the dip net for later analysis.
The T075B's were now in the middle of Race Pass and appeared to be resting against the current. The T075C's hadn't been seen for close to 10 minutes since the previous prey sharing and then a young seal, no more than a month or two old, came up for air wide-eyed in front of T75C and her newest calf T075C2 who reappeared slightly inshore of the rest of the group. They then all started to harass and torment this seal for 45 minutes before they finally put it out its misery.
At the 40 minute mark, when Mark and Hanna thought they had finally drowned it and were prey sharing, the whales surfaced. They were moving quickly towards the west edge of Race Rocks as the seal had almost eluded them and was within 100 meters of the rocks. They then did a few more rushes at it, and T075C grabbed it and dragged it under to finish it off finally.

Mark and Hanna mobilized Mike 1 and departed Victoria harbour at ~1200 and made their way north up Haro Strait expecting to find them somewhere in Boundary Pass.
At ~1230, as they were north of Kelp Reef they spotted Gary Sutton and Tasli Shaw on Sonic south bound in Haro Strait to the west of them near Halibut Island. They had received a vague second hand report of a sighting near Pender and assumed that it was J pod as they had been seen south bound near Nanaimo the evening before but after consulting with Mark decided to turn around and head north into Boundary to help search for what Mark believed were Bigg's earlier spotted.
Mike 1 ran the border, stopping to scan several times before stopping for a longer scan and lunch break at East Point. Sonic ran along the shoreline of South Pender and Saturna and continued out past Mike 1 at East Point and stopped to scan to the north east of Boiling Reef.
While Mark and Gary were making a game plan to continue north west out the Strait of Georgia thinking they would be looking for new whales at this point Tasli spotted killer whales in the tide rip to the east of them at ~1335.
Gary quickly identified them as the T049A's less T049A1 and T049A2 along with the T049B's.
Both crews watched them prey share in the tide rip for ~ 30 minutes before seeing them continue off to the north east towards Alden Bank and they ended the encounter at 1406.

In the last few years, the killer whale sightings have been more reliable to the north, but strong north winds and adverse current made their decision to go west easier.
After making their way through Race Passage, they made their way out to the shipping lanes and stopped to scan south of Otter Point. With moderate outflow winds, they decided to quarter their way back towards the shoreline of East Sooke and headed east back to Victoria with a brief stop and scan at Race Rocks, returning to Victoria harbour at 1330.
At 1438 Mark received a call from George Hamilton, who had spotted a small group of killer whales while spotting from the Ten Mile Point lookout, northbound north of Beaumont Shoals. He noted that the winds had abated, and the seas had flattened out substantially since the morning.

Mike 1 trolled along at 4 knots at the west edge of the group waiting for their next sequence and then spotted the bull on a kill and could see the other three moving quickly towards them. Once Mike 1 made it closer to the group, Mark was able to confirm the large bull as T069C and could see it was the rest of the T069's, four individuals. After a few minutes of prey sharing, they resumed their track to the north and passed over the eastern edge of Kelp Reef with T069 and T069E resuming their position ~ .25nm west of T069C and T069F.

Mark called Gord Rowles to let him know of their plan and to have him look through the Big Eyes to make sure they didn't overlook any whales in the more immediate area.
As Mike 1 was about to enter Race Passage, Gord called over the VHF to alert them of killer whales in Oak Bay. Mike 1 spun around and headed east towards Trial Island. Gord had spotted a bull and a smaller individual slightly south of the Oak Bay Flats west bound. Mark and Hanna slowed down south of Trial Island slightly west of where Gord had last seen them to have a scan and within a minute Hanna spotted the pair north west bound heading towards a large aggregation of feeding gulls with a few bald eagles circling above a likely herring ball. Mark got out his Swarovski binoculars and was able to see that they were looking at either T077A or T049C along with what was likely T065A5 following a few metres behind. This juvenile male had been reported in Active Pass a few days before. Once Mark got a photograph of the pair he was able to conclude that was the 6 year old male T065A5 along with T049C, not T077A who has remarkably similar notches in his dorsal fin.
Surprisingly, this pair passed by the herring ball and likely feeding seals and made their way towards another bait ball slightly to the north west closer to the Chain Islands. Again they passed by this one, split up and headed south west towards Trial Island with T049C now a half mile or more ahead.
As T049C approached the southern tip of Trial Island he did 3 cartwheels and then a breach.

He and Hanna were at the Ten Mile Point lookout watching sunrise and scanning for whales at that time and could see the perfect water conditions, so Mark arranged with his carpenter to take the morning off to find the group reported to the north.
They left Victoria harbour at 0845 on Mike 1 and made their way north up the west side of Haro Strait. Mark had contacted Lisa Moorby on North Pender Island to see if she could keep a lookout from shore as his friend reported that the large group was last seen heading northwest up the middle of Swanson Channel south of the Pender Bluffs. He had later called Mark to report a single male trailing the group near Gooch Island that Mark figured was T010C by a decent iPhone photo that was forwarded to him.
When Lisa couldn't see any sign of them from the lookout near Mouat Point, it made sense to head to the last known position as it appeared that they must have stalled out or turned around.
Mark and Bernie stopped to do a binocular scan when they got slightly north of Gooch Island, and with no sign of any blows or fins towards Stuart and Pender, they continued north up the east side of Moresby. At 0953, as they rounded Pelorus Point, they saw a group of killer whales off their bow coming towards them. They put the brakes on, and Mark immediately recognized the T010's and T049A's as they completed their last breath before going into a long dive. As Mike 1 trolled along back to the south waiting for the next sequence, Mark spotted more animals behind them at the north end of Moresby Island. He had a look through his Swarovski's and could see that they were milling as if on a kill and then saw an animal from the original group porpoising back to the north at Pelorus Point. They caught up to what turned out to be T049A2 leading the charge with the others sauntering along a couple hundred metres behind. Mike 1 and T049A2 arrived in unison to see T063, T065, the T049B's, and the T071's milling about in a social group. There was no evidence of a kill as there was no sign of a slick, birds, or any prey. The T049A's joined in the socialization, which lasted for several minutes as they slowly worked their way north up Swanson Channel within a quarter-mile of Moresby Island. The T010's were tight to the shore and didn't seem interested in joining the social group of 18 animals.
Mike 1 ended the encounter at 1054 as the animals reached the top end of Moresby Island and started to fan out as they continued traveling north on a line for Active Pass. As they were taxiing away past Canoe Rock, Mark received a report of another group of 3 killer whales southbound in Active Pass. He had promised Bernie to have him back to the dock by 1230, so he decided to leave them for Morningstar to confirm as they were on their way to check out the whales Mike 1 had found. Mark later heard that Morningstar had confirmed the T099s joined them from the north. This group of 25 were last seen in Trincomali Channel, which eventually parted ways with the T010's, T063, T065, and the 099's continuing north and the T049A's, T049B's and the T071's headed back south.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-18

Val Messier joined him and they departed the dock at Victoria harbour at ~1400.
Gord Rowles was scanning from his perch at his 23rd floor apartment but was limited to seeing well south due to the hazy conditions so Mark and Val went well south on a line from Victoria over the east edge of Constance Bank towards Dungeness. Five hours had passed since the 1000 report and when they were ~20 nm south east of the reported position they scanned for close to 15 minutes in flat calm seas to only see many harbour porpoise. They felt that with the building ebb current it was unlikely the whales were to the east so they proceeded west as far as Victor Foxtrot and after another good binocular scan they headed for Race Rocks and then made their way to Victoria harbour. At 1618 they received another second hand report from Paul that a group of east bound killer whales were spotted from shore near Otter Point. Mike 1 turned around and headed that way and Paul departed his dock and located the reported whales within a half mile of the Sooke bluffs a few minutes before Mark and Val arrived at 1700. They quickly confirmed the T010's, T063 and 065 along with the T086A's and another unidentified matriline of 3 or 4 individuals later to be confirmed as the T068A's.
The group continued east and worked their way into the shoreline of East Sooke Park after passing through the kelp bed at the south edge of Secretary Island. No obvious predation was observed and Mike 1 ended the encounter at 1818 as the group continued east past Bechey Head.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-17

Dave and Katie met at Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1335. We arrived on scene about a mile and a half west of Skipjack Island around 1410. The whales were very active with one main group of young whales doing most of the splashing and rolling around. This group was doing all sorts of behaviors-very few of them fitting nicely into our behavior categories. A few of the older whales were loosely spread within a 100 yards of the play group. Another pair of sub-adults were rolling around together a few dozen yards to the side of the younger whales. At least one of these two was a male. The transients turned out to be the T49As and the T71s-11 whales in total. One of the two subadults was T49A3, who we know to be a male, but the other was T71C and he (?) certainly looked and acted like another pre-sprouter male. The youngest whales present (T49A5 and T71B2) switched back and forth between traveling slightly ahead with their mothers and going back to join the fun in the rear play group.
The T49As and T71s traveled northeast toward Patos Island. They briefly looked like they were heading for the east end of the island before turning and heading back west. The whales rounded Alden Point on Patos Island and then turned east again along the north side of the island. They then continued east along the north side of Sucia and Matia Islands passing, at various points, Steller sea lions and harbor seals hauled out on the rocks. Other than a couple of brief periods where the whales spread out a little and did a little milling, no serious hunting was observed and the whales remained social for the entire encounter. We ended the encounter at 1745 about a mile northwest of Barnes and Clark Islands with the whales heading southeast.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-16

He and Joe mobilized Mike 1 and departed the dock in Victoria at 1450. By the time they reached Ogden Point, the whales were almost in sight of the harbour, just north east of Albert Head. The female had not been seen in roughly 40 minutes prior to their arrival, but a large bull was clearly visible on the horizon. Mark and Joe slowed and began the encounter at 1505 at 48 24.4 N/ 123 24.5 W (a mile and half south of Ogden Point).
The bull surfaced nearby and was confirmed to be T010C, so it was assumed that his mom T010 was the second whale. Sure enough, after ~10 minutes tracking the large male a second animal appeared just ahead of him, milling in place. With the distinctive notch near the base of her dorsal fin T010 was confirmed. The two whales continued working the area, apparently after a seal, though no other marine mammal was ever observed. The predation event began at 1522 at 48 23.7 N/ 123 23.6 W. For close to an hour the pair circled and dove, disappearing for over five minutes at times, only to reappear in the same spot, drifting closer to the waterfront with the current. They finally finished the hunt at 1617 at 48 24.0 N/ 123 23.6 W. The smell and oil slick at the surface drew in all the local gulls and the whales turned back to the west once they had finished prey sharing. They initially looked as though they were going to enter Victoria harbour but chose to cross the mouth and continue west towards Royal Roads.
The T010's are two of only a handful of Bigg's known to enter the harbour on more than one occasion, having done so several times in the past decade, the most recent being just over two years ago.

Dave and Katie met at Snug Harbor and left in the “Orcinus” shortly afterwards. We arrived on scene around 1320 about a mile southwest of Sandy Point on Waldron Island. The first whales we saw were the J16s traveling slowly southeast toward San Juan Channel. J36 detached from the rest of the J16s and moved on ahead of the other three. Another whale was about a mile to the southeast of the J16s and other whales could be seen spread out over a mile ahead of us in the White Rock area. A few spread out whales could be seen foraging deep in Mouatt Bay. We moved from one spread out whale to the next spread out whale as J pod moved slowly SE past White Rock and Flattop Island. Some whales moved toward Orcas Island and came around the corner of Jones Island while entering San Juan Channel while others moved over to the San Juan Island shoreline. We were seeing the occasional fish chase so foraging was going on.
Once the whales made it into San Juan Channel, one or two groups began to form. J36, J37, J40, and J49 formed a loose group where J36 and J49 were rolling around and splashing together. We also found J44 and J53 traveling quietly together behind most of the other whales. These two were being gently tactile with one another. Another large social group began forming as the whales approached the Wasp Islands. This large milling group included the previous foursome along with the J22s, J41s, and J39. We then dropped back to the trailing whales with hopes of finding individuals we had not seen yet that day. We found J27 but the other whales back near the trailers were a couple members of the J16s again.

After a bunch more phone calls to and from various people, Dave headed to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1025. Whales were seen shortly after leaving the harbor not far from Kellett Bluff. One or two others were foraging off the mouth of Open Bay. J37 was seen chasing a salmon off the south end of Kellett Bluff. J pod ended up being very spread out from the one side of Haro Strait to the other for the whole day as they headed slowly north. Dave went back and forth across the strait for the entire encounter, slowly picking off individuals. The best group seen all day was mid-afternoon in lower Swanson Channel and included J31, J56, J40, J42, J46, and J51. However, the moment Dave got parallel with this group, they caught the wake of a freighter heading toward Cowichan Bay and surfed right past him before splitting up.

He watched them pause in front of his condo in Oak Bay for a brief meal before continuing SW towards Staines Point (south end of Trial Island). Joe met Mark and Val at the dock, and the three headed out to Constance Bank to begin the encounter. It had already been a great day for CWR, with Dave putting in a strong effort to the east, collecting Encounters #10 and #11! Encounter #12 commenced at 1410 along the north edge of Constance Bank at 48 21.8 N/ 123 20.9 W.
The T137's and T099's were both present. The whales were spread out as Mike 1 approached; T137A and T099C were the furthest east and offshore, T137 was on her own to the west and inshore, the rest were grouped tightly in between.
They converged in less than ten minutes and traveled closely for the remainder of the encounter.
As a whale watch, RHIB approached the group at 1440, and having collected left-side ID photos from each individual present, Mike 1 disengaged and headed south in search of more. They had not quite picked up speed when a small cetacean appeared just a half-mile off the bow, and as it surfaced again, it was clearly a small humpback! After spending 20 unsuccessful minutes attempting to collect an ID photo of the youngster's tail fluke, the trio decided to loop back to the Bigg's. Radio relays suggested that the group had perhaps nabbed a seal, though when Mike 1 arrived back on scene, there were no signs of predation. The animals were tightly grouped and high-speed porpoising towards Race Rocks and the southwest, though they were making little more than 5 knots over the bottom fighting a strong flood current. After collecting a few right-side ID shots, The Mike 1 crew ended the encounter two miles east of William Head at 48 19.9 N/123 29.0 W and turned for the harbour at 1605.

We filed this info away while we continued our J pod encounter with hopes that they would take us close enough to Cattle Pass that we could rationalize temporarily leaving the residents to take a look at the pair of transients.
When we were near Hein Bank with J pod, we received another report of a group of whales near MacArthur Bank that did not seem like it could be J pod whales. Since we were having trouble finding the very spread out J pod whales that we knew were around, we decided to go investigate. Our search took us over towards Iceberg Point and then we headed over to the Whale Rock area in Cattle Pass hoping that T77A and T124C got lost in Griffin Bay for a couple of hours. When we were near Whale Rocks, we received another report that someone had seen a pair of male killer whales about halfway between Colville Island and Smith Island. The weather and water were beautiful so we decided to keep searching and turned around and headed southeast toward Minor Island. The sighting conditions were excellent so it was a little discouraging that we hadn’t seen anything yet as we approached the area just a little north of Minor Island. We were about a half mile east of Minor Island and beginning to think the pair of Ts had disappeared as they had lots of directions that they could have headed. We were feeling a bit disappointed and, since we were there, decided to circumnavigate Smith and Minor Islands before heading home when Katie spotted the whales to the south of us in the middle of a sun streak.

We got to the whales at about 1320 about a half mile south of Minor Island right as they went on a long dive. When they came up again the two were tight together heading slowly south-southeast. After their next long dive, the pair surfaced about a quarter mile apart, paralleling each-other's course. Around 1355, the two whales turned and began approaching one another at a bit quicker pace making us think that they may have found something. We then noticed a large, very freaked out Steller sea lion performing evasive maneuvers. While we never saw the whales surface near the sea lion, it was obvious they checked it out and briefly tested it before, disappointingly, moving on. When the pair came up again, they were back together traveling slowly south-southeast.

The first two whales we saw were J47 and J49 traveling south together with another juvenile a few hundred yards to the west of them. There was another three or four whales about a quarter mile to the south of J47 and J49. Around 10am, J47 and J49 caught up to the group ahead of them and they all began milling and acting like they were harassing a porpoise. A few minutes later, we had a pair of harbor porpoise come directly over to our boat and then disappeared. Looking at our pictures later, one porpoise had fresh killer whale teeth marks on it. Jeanne got photos from shore of this group and her photos clearly show at least one adult porpoise in the midst of the J pod whales. Some of the whales involved with the porpoise harassment were J31, J56, J36, J47, and J49.
We then moved offshore to find more whales and found the rest of the J16s spread out about a mile southwest of the porpoise harassers. We weren’t seeing any other whales to the west of us so we started heading back to the southeast to find someone new. We came across a loose foursome of J31, J56, J44, and J46 heading slowly southeast. Next we found J36 and J40 loosely spread also pointed southeast.

The encounter began at 1010 at 48 22.0 N/ 123 23.8 W as the two slowed for the first animal they spotted. Just south of the VH Buoy, they confirmed J27 followed by several juveniles and/or females with J37 among them.
Within a few hundred metres was J26, followed closely by J47, who looked like was picking up scraps from a snack, though no obvious predation was observed. The pair were soon joined by J35 and J27 and this group of four socialized for several minutes before they split up and J47 continued following J26 in his slipstream. Mark and Joe travelled roughly two miles SSE in search of two larger dorsal fins they had been tracking in the distance. As they closed in on the southern edge of the group, several females and the odd juvenile also appeared, J19 and J41 among them. J39 was nearby and with the clear winter light they decided that he was one of the two bulls seen from afar looking bigger than he is. At the same time, roughly .75 nm east they spotted J38 who they decided was the other bull had seen in the distance earlier.
After J38, J39 and a few others passed to the west, Mike 1 swept south of Race Rocks in search of several animals that had slipped between the young bulls and the ecological reserve. The ebb current was slowing, but the animals were moving west with good pace, averaging about 6 knots.
They then located J53 and J56 swimming alongside each other with J31 less than a quarter mile away offshore.
While J53 and J56 were frolicking in a tidal rip for close to 10 minutes J51 appeared and joined them. At one point they fanned out only to reconvene, milling in place for a couple of minutes as if they were prey sharing but no fish scraps or scales were observed.
The Mike 1 crew then worked their way to the north to confirm the identities of the trailers (J36, J35 and J44) and with the outflow winds picking up offshore, Mark and Joe ended the encounter at 1300 offshore of Church Rock (48 17.2/123 34.6).

Notably absent was L87 though he was not confirmed with this group when they most recently entered the Juan de Fuca with K's on February 19th (Encounter #6) or in the Strait of Georgia with J's the following day (Encounter #7).

They presumed to be the Southern Residents that were in the Sound the last couple of days. Jane Cogan relayed this information to Mark as he was preparing to head out on a 1000 whale watch trip for Prince of Whales. He called his friend Gord Rowles and told him to have a look with the Big Eyes from his perch on the 23rd floor to the south of Discovery Island towards the ODAS buoy. As Mark was working his way off towards that area Gord spotted multiple blows well south of the ODAS and slightly east of the Romeo buoy. At 1100 Mark was able to confirm members of J, K, and L pods moving steadily west at 48 15.2/123 12.9. Morningstar was also out looking for them so Mark relayed the location and departed several minutes after they arrived to take his guests to Race Rocks before returning to Victoria harbour at 1300.
Mark and Joe departed Victoria on Mike 1 with colleague Lili Wilson at 1345 to assist Dave Ellifrit on Orca with confirming all individuals present. The first whales they encountered were ~ 1 nm from the VH buoy, and turned out to be foraging J pod whales. They began the encounter there at 1411 at 48° 21.07’ N / 123° 24.48’ W and watched J22 and J31 with J56 chasing fish for a few minutes. J38 eventually joined the mother/calf pair and the three were observed prey-sharing at 1424. Fortunately, some scales floated free and Mark was quick on the net, collecting 2 for analysis.

As the whales turned southwest, the Mike 1 crew moved on to the south towards a denser grouping offshore of Albert Head. This turned out to be L110 and K42 socializing, and K34, L106 and L116 doing the same under a half mile south. As these whales were joined by J40 and settled into southerly travel, Mark, Joe and Lili carried on to more whales travelling south of Race Rocks. These animals were spread out and travelling quickly west while doing roughly five-minute dives. Among others and from south to north, L109, K21, K33, K12, K27, L87, L116 and L82 were present.

With light fading and the whales making good progress west, Mark, Joe and Lili moved inshore to collect proof-of-presence photos for K26 and L72 with L105 before cruising back towards Race Rocks. They ran into J39 and a female foraging just west of the park bounds at Race Rocks, and ended the encounter at 1630 at 48° 17.77’ N / 123° 33.55’ W. En route back to Victoria the crew once again encountered J31 and J56, who were now travelling southwest with J27 at 1655 at 48° 18.05’ N / 123° 29.8’ W.

Jane called again late morning to say that they were aboard “Morning Star” near the “R” buoy with Js, Ks, and some Ls heading west. Dave left Snug Harbor around 1205 and took a route through Baynes Channel and southwest until several miles southwest of Constance Bank before finally arriving on scene around 1310. The whales were very spread out, taking lengthy long dives, and most seemed to be foraging. The whales were heading westerly with many whales angling inshore toward Race Passage. Dave first encountered members of the K12s who were spread out in two loose pairs (K22/K33 and K12/K43) and a single (K37). The whales were not being easy to follow and often came up a long way away after a long dive. K21 was seen at a distance but he disappeared and Dave moved on to other difficult whales. L87 and L82 were seen traveling as a loose pair and then K20 and K38 seen after them, also in a loose pair. There seemed to be more whales to the north than the south so that was direction the boat moved whenever it moved on to the next whale in sight. L47 and L115 were seen and briefly swam under a rainbow. L116 was following these two by a couple hundred yards. J37 was encountered next but a nearby small whale that was probably J49 escaped un-photographed. To the northwest of J37, K16 and K35 were seen and photographed and then L72 and L105 in yet another loose pair.
By this point, Mark was back on the water on Mike 1 and was getting photos of whales Dave was never going to get to and it was time to start thinking about heading home anyway. Dave tried to end the encounter at about 1520 about halfway between Albert and William Heads. On the way home, J27 passed by south of the Victoria waterfront. Further east from J27, “Morning Star” had found most of the J16s while on their way home and Dave stopped to get pictures of J16, J26, and J42 before he continued on his way home too at 1555. Since the whales were so spread out, it was not the sort of day to say anything definitive about potential missing whales. We feel confident that the L12s, L54s, and L88 were not present this day but probably all of the Js, Ks, and L4s, L47s, L72s, plus L87 and L90 were.

They departed Victoria at 1145, working offshore of Victoria and across Constance Bank before turning to pass south of Race Rocks and search west along the inbound shipping lanes. They were south of Secretary Island when reports of killer whales near Victoria came in. They extrapolated that the animals must have been near or in Race Pass on Mike 1’s outbound search, and turned east to catch up to the animals.

At 1412 they spotted fins and blows just south of Trial Island and began Encounter # 01 for 2020 at 48 22.5/123 18.5. The first whales observed were T124C and T124A3 with her first calf, T124A3A. This trio was travelling quickly east in pursuit of a larger group approximately a half mile on. After quick proof of presence photos, the Mike 1 crew forged ahead to find the T090s and T124As travelling in two mixed groups. T090C was a few hundred meters to the north of his family travelling alongside T124A and her youngest, T124A6, while T124A4 travelled with the rest of the T090s. These whales were moving swiftly ESE into building southeast seas, but as they reached Middle Bank at 1520 the sea calmed and the group came together to stealthily snag a meal at 48° 24.5 N / 123° 07.9 W. The predation was quick; though no prey item was observed, the smell was faintly noticeable, a slick formed as some gulls picked up a few scraps and a short prey-share followed. The T124A3s and T124C did not join the predation, instead continuing ESE roughly .75 nm south of the group.

Meanwhile, a whale-watch vessel was departing a third group of killer whales, the T101's, approximately 2.5 nm north west of the lead animals. As the T090/T124 group resumed travel at 1530, the Mike 1 crew departed to rendezvous with them. At 1540 the three T101 son's large dorsal fins broke the surface almost simultaneously off Mike 1's bow. This group had initially been picked up at Trial Island by whale-watchers to the north of the T090/T124 group, and were roughly shadowing them. The whales were loosely spread, T101 and T101A travelling approximately 200 meters to the south of T102 and T101B. Eventually T101 took the lead and T101A joined his brothers to follow her east-southeast. As the rain began to fall and the wind picked up, the Mike 1 crew opted to head for Victoria after capturing proof of presence photos for all individuals, ending the encounter at 1610 at 48° 26.0 N / 123° 04.8 W.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2020encounters/2020-1

Dave eventually caught up and the encounter began at 1240 about a mile or so off Pt. Doughty on Orcas Island. Most of the whales were in a tight group and “J2” had reported that T34A and T34A1 had split off but were somewhere in the area. The whales turned more easterly and then fanned out and began hunting once they neared Parker Reef. T34A and T34A1 appeared again nearer to Matia Island. They also appeared to be on the hunt as they were changing directions often and T34A was taking long enough dives that T34A1 had to come up for air on its own a couple of times. No kill could be confirmed and the pair eventually straightened out and headed northeast between Puffin Island and the eastern shoreline of Matia Island. The other whales were still spread out but they were also heading northeast toward the gap between the two islands following T34A and T34A1.

The whales were thought to be Southern Residents, so he and Joe along with their colleague and friend Valerie Messier mobilized Mike 1 and departed Victoria at 1111. They had only made it ten minutes out of the harbour before coming across a large concentration of foraging killer whales just west of Constance Bank. They began the encounter at 1133 at 48 19.6/123 25.9 (~4 nm NE of Race Rocks) and quickly confirmed several members of K pod. The whales were spread to the north and southwest but all seemed more interested in foraging than going anywhere quickly. J31 and calf J56 were foraging alongside K37, and the youngest Southern Resident breached three or four times while mom searched for food.

As the ebb picked up, all of the K pod whales ceased foraging and headed west quickly, aiming at Race Pass. Several of the group passed through the reserve, travelling between Helicopter and North Race Rocks, while the majority took the Pass and at least three individuals passed south of Race Rocks. There was considerable swell in Race Pass, but the whales surfed through it with ease. As the animals slowed upon exiting to the west, the Mike 1 crew opted to break off from them and head offshore to the southwest before looping back to the shoreline. They suspected there may be some unaccounted-for J pod whales in the area, and hoped that the rest of the group that had been in Puget Sound over the past few days would appear. They were south of Beechey Head when Joe picked up a distant bull closer to shore, along with a smaller animal. These animals were travelling slowly west, but taking long dives. The male appeared long enough to be identified as K21, but disappeared quickly on another long dive and with more animals spotted to the west the crew forged on.

Several miles west of K21 and his companion were several more westbound killer whales, and these were even more elusive than the last. After confirming K26 and a small group of Pacific white-sided dolphins joined the fray! The “lags” (from the scientific name for Pacific white-sided dolphins, Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) raced off towards a small group of killer whales less than a mile inshore of them, and the Mike 1 crew watched in anticipation of a meeting. The whales dove though, and the lags opted to play alongside Mike 1 for a few moments before disappearing to the east. Mark and Joe returned their focus to the outbound whales, and shortly L55 was identified. Several others just offshore of her were seen but with 7 to 9 minute dives and short breathing cycles in between it was not possible to confirm those IDs as the rain started to close back in and the crew felt it was time to head back to Victoria.

They ended the encounter at 1449 at 48 19.8/123 50.7 (~2nm SW of Otter Point) and turned for home. They did not re-sight the trailing group along the way; with a strong ebb current it is possible they were pulled offshore into the rain and poor visibility.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2019encounters/2019-106

Dave grabbed his gear and headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat around 0845. Since no one had spotted the whales yet, Dave went searching down the west side of San Juan Island about a mile offshore to about False Bay. No killer whales were found but a single humpback was briefly seen offshore of Hannah Heights. Since it was likely to be breezier south of False Bay but was calmer to the west, Dave decided to head southwesterly toward Sea Bird Point and continued on to about a mile and a half southeast of Trial Island. Dave had just turned around to search another direction when Mark called over the radio and said there were a bunch of whales on the west side of Trial Island. Dave hurried over and the encounter started at about 1020.
The first whales encountered were a large group of all the Js with L87 plus the K27s and most of the L4s. The group acted like they had just met up and were being social. Several whales logged at the surface and some of them were vocalizing. The whales were pointed west but not really going anywhere and there was a lot of milling going on. The large group broke up into several smaller groups and most of the whales still seemed to be socializing as there were milling balls of whales spreading out in every direction. For a short while, it was very super pod like behavior. More whales were trickling in from the west and these were mostly K pod whales along with a few more Ls. After searching many groups, it became clear that the L12s, L54s, and L88 were not present this day but all the Js, Ks, L4s, L47s, L72s, L90, and L87 were. All whales present were photographed by the end of the encounter. Once the eastbound Ks and Ls met the others, all the whales began moving easterly but very slowly and there was a lot of milling and socializing still going on.

Less than 15 minutes from the harbour, Mark spotted a distant dorsal fin just northeast of Race Rocks amongst several humpbacks diving. They slowed in the southeasterly swell in order to lock on to the killer whale, and began the encounter at 1250 ~3.5 nm ENE of William Head (48 21.9/123 26.7). No other killer whale fins or blows were seen, and they moved closer to confirm a lone male Bigg's whale. T097 was travelling ENE steadily, until ten minutes into the encounter when he nabbed a small mammal, likely a harbour seal or harbour porpoise, at 48 21.6/123 26.1.

These whales were last seen heading east in the Juan de Fuca Strait a few miles south east of Race Rocks.
They spotted the bull T251 (also known as CA166/U033) in short order. He was travelling stealthily to the NE ~ 5 nm SSE of Race Rocks (48 14.2/123 26.1), and apparently alone, so after confirming his identity they continued on to find the rest of the group. With the help of Gord spotting from Victoria through Big Eyes, Mark and Joe were able to pick up a group of three animals, including a weeks old calf, only a few miles to the NW of T251. This group turned out to be more outer-coastals and the new mother was confirmed to be T253.
There was a second adult female travelling with the pair, though she has yet to be identified. We will follow up shortly with an update on this! (have sent photos to Jared Towers/DFO). As the name suggests, outer-coastal are rarely encountered in the inner waters of the Salish Sea and identification can be difficult.
Mark and Joe watched as the trio steadily tracked east at 48 16.0/123 26.7 pausing only briefly to make short work of a harbour porpoise at 1527 (48 16.1/123 25.9). The whales disappeared on a long dive after approximately five minutes of prey sharing, giving the Mike 1 crew time for a quick scan. Joe spotted a large bull about a mile east of them, presumably T251, and several several others appeared to have joined him. Mark and Joe made their way carefully to that area and were able to spot two adult females and a juvenile, though they did not see the elusive bull again. These animals were confirmed as T252, the presumed mother of both T251 and T253, and U083 along with another as yet unidentified outer-coastal. These whales were spread over .75 nm travelling slowly to the ENE. U083 and the unidentified juvenile came together briefly to take a run at a Steller sealion but moved on after a single swipe and slowly pointed NW towards Constance Bank. T252 joined the pair and all continued along a northwesterly path. At this point Mark spotted more killer whales apparently porpoising to the SE from Constance Bank! As the outer-coastal group had disappeared at that moment and the action seemed to be to the north of them, Mark and Joe opted to head for the new group of whales.
They reached the group as light was fading and knew they would have to work quickly to confirm identities. The first whale to surface was T034 and she was followed shortly by the rest of her family. All members of the T034 and T037B matriline were confirmed along with T037. T037 was recently observed travelling with members of the T036 matriline for a week or so, though she is typically with her daughter T037B and presumed mother T034 but seems to have made her way back to them. The seas were calm and the whales spent a minute or two logging on the surface, very audibly vocalizing. The three outer-coastals approached from the south and were welcomed into a very social crowd. Mike 1 stayed until the light faded and the audible blows suggested the whales were continuing in a northeasterly direction, perhaps aiming for Discovery Island. The encounter concluded at 1655 (48 17.8/123 20.3) and Mike 1 returned to Victoria harbour in the dark and secured to the dock at 1715.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2019encounters/2019-103

There were moderate SE winds to the east of Victoria, so the four planned to travel across the Victoria waterfront as far as possible before turning south towards Dungeness Spit and eventually west. They departed the dock at 0930 and had traveled less than ten minutes from the harbor mouth when they stumbled onto killer whales within a mile of Staines Point on Trial Island! The encounter began at 0953 at 48 22.9/123 18.4, and the T046B's were quickly confirmed as the distinctive leucistic light grey T046B1B surface swiftly alongside her mother. The whales were traveling quickly towards Seabird Point on the south end of Discovery Island, averaging 8-9 knots over the bottom. They were tightly grouped, and all eight members confirmed with the youngsters T046B6 and T046B1B looking plump and energized. No predation was observed.
As the whales neared Seabird Point, Discovery Island, the seas began to pick up, and the whales altered course to the SE into strong headwinds and 3' waves. The encounter was ended at 1043 at 48 25.1/123 10.6 (2 nm east of Discovery Island) as a whale watch boat out of Victoria was arriving with the whales still traveling ESE.

The previous two days saw large waves of Bigg's killer whales enter the area, with around 40 unique individuals accounted for in the Salish Sea. A light wind out of the southeast, a strong ebb current and a quiet morning of hilltop scans had them more optimistic about their chances west. They stopped briefly northeast of Race Rocks for a small aggregation of humpback whales in the area. They estimated 6-8 whales within two square miles, including BCX0470 ""Hecate"" and BCZ0180 ""Monarch"" before continuing southwest.

They reached Race Pass and opted to continue along the Canadian shoreline as it can be a hotspot this time of year. The two reached Secretary Island before the tidal chop picked up and pushed them to a weather tack south. They slowed mid-Strait for a scan before looping back to the east when Mark spotted several killer whales just to the west, apparently headed SSE. They began the encounter here at 1150 (48 15.2/123 44.2). These whales turned out to be several of the T046Bs; the T046B1s were spotted just under a mile south. All of the whales turned west on the next surfacing, and Joe spotted several more blows approximately 1.5 miles west of them. Mark and Joe made their way slowly towards this larger group and were rewarded with the early stages of a Steller sea lion hunt at 1203 (48 14.4/123 47.2). The animals involved turned out to be the T028Bs, T030Bs, T117B, T121As and T172, several rare visitors to the Salish Sea. The T046Bs arrived in their matrilineal groups and waited on the periphery of the hunt, along with T117A. The large group continuously rammed and breached upon the sea lion, and had pulled it under within 30 minutes. The T046Bs and later T117A joined the predation and all whales fed for close to an hour as they drifted west with the ebb current. The T028Bs, T030Bs, T117B, the T121As and T172 grouped up and angled ENE towards Becher Bay or Race Rocks, and the T046Bs and T117A shortly followed suit. Mark and Joe ended the encounter at 1401 (48 15.9/123 47.9 with all of the animals grouped tightly together travelling east.

From the fin shapes of the small group, he saw his impression was that they were Bigg's. He immediately alerted Gord Rowles to have him keep track of them and swiftly left the lookout to head for town and mobilize Mike 1 and contacted Joe to meet him at the dock ASAP.
Mike 1 departed Victoria harbour at 0940 and headed east towards Sea Bird Point on Discovery Island as Gord had last seen the group disappear out of his view between Trial Island and Discovery Island. He guessed they were Southern Residents as he saw a large group he estimated to be close to 20 individuals with at least two bulls. As Joe and Mark crossed the Oak Bay Flats, they spotted the large group spread out traveling northeast. Mark got out the Swarovskis to confirm ecotype and still guessed Bigg's, which was confirmed when they simultaneously spotted the unmistakable leucistic T046B1B along with the rest of the T046Bs. They started the encounter at precisely 1000 ~0.5 miles south of Discovery Island and were able to confirm all of the T036s, T037, the T046Bs, the T123s, and the two CAs from the day before, CA040 and CA137, were present. They could see another eastbound group slightly south of them, which Joe guessed was likely the T035As and T038As and intended to get to them once they finished the encounter with the large group.
At 1033 the T036As, along with T037, came across a lone seal at 48 25.1/123 11.5 and started to hunt it. The T036Bs were first to get in on the fun, the T046Bs came in from the south, the T123s turned back from the north to join in and eventually CA040, and CA137 completed the group. It seemed that there was only one seal involved in this gathering, and after ~30 minutes, the prey sharing began, and it wasn't for close to another 30 minutes before the group started traveling eastward. At 1159 Mark and Joe ended the encounter and went looking for the group that was to the south of the others when they first arrived. They were near Hein Bank scanning when Joe spotted Jeff Friedman on J1 westbound near Salmon Bank. He was on his way to look for the humpbacks that had been off Victoria for the last few weeks, so he was thrilled to hear that Mike 1 had just departed a large group of Bigg's. After several minutes of scanning Mark and Joe decided to swing southwest before turning west back towards Victoria and returned to the harbour at ~1430. At 1529 Mark received a report from Jeff that he had stumbled into the T035As and the T038As entering Cattle Pass on a northbound track as he was headed home to Friday Harbor.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2019encounters/2019-98

A few minutes later, Mark received a text from Steve McConnell on the pilot boat that he had seen likely the same group to the west at ~1030 passing east past the VH buoy. Steve sent Mark some photos he had taken with his iPhone, and they looked like Bigg's. Mark contacted Joe, and they met at Mike 1 and departed Victoria harbour at ~ 1215. Mark had contacted Gord Rowles earlier to track them from his 23rd-floor apartment, and Gord had last seen them at ~1200 continue southeast after working on a kill slightly south of Discovery Island. When Mike 1 arrived at the spot where Gord had last seen them, they stopped and scanned and could see Jeff Friedman on J1 slightly north of them. They gave Jeff a call to see if he was with anything, and he had just spotted a group of northbound Bigg's, which he later identified as the T034's, T037B's, and the T099's. Mike 1 started to work their way towards Jeff's group when Joe spotted more killer whales ~ 1.5 miles to the south, so they turned around and headed to them instead. At 1231 they came across a large slick from a kill at 48 23.4/123 11.7, which was likely where Gord had last seen them through the Big Eyes. At 1238 Mark and Joe started their encounter after confirming the T035A's, T036A's, and T038A's along with an unidentified bull spread out and traveling east (48 22.2/123 10.7) 3.5 nm SSE of Discovery Island. Joe eventually was able to identify the bull as CA137, and later on in the encounter, Mark had spotted a trailing very cryptic female who was CA040. She would come up for two breaths every 5 - 6 minutes following well behind the rest of the group.

This was the only way they could possibly get on scene before dark. Mark arrived at Fisherman's dock at 1540 just as Joe arrived and off they went.

He got a hold of Joe Zelweitro and invited Bill Moore along as they had just finished up a lunch meeting.
They left Victoria harbour at ~1430 and worked their way out to the east of the last known location (48 20/123 18). It was tough slogging with the strong north east winds and 2-3 foot chop but at ~1500 they spotted north east bound killer whales in a tight resting group with help from Gord Rowles who had a lock on them through Big Eye binoculars from his 23rd floor apartment. They started the encounter at 1506 (48 21.2/123 15.3) and quickly were able to identify members of K's along with most of the L's including L87.

They suspected that J's would likely show up off Victoria's waterfront before the day ended so continued west with hopes to find K's and L's or some more exotic killer whales. They headed west out the middle of the Juan de Fuca and spotted blows between Pillar Point and Clallam Bay and confirmed they were humpbacks. With large swell and minimal wind they decided to push on knowing that to allow any time for a killer whale encounter and make it as far as Swiftsure Bank there was no time for humpback ID's, especially with the short daylight hours. The swell increased to 3 - 4 metres but they managed to get to the Bank. Although there was a tremendous amount of bird life they only spotted a few humpback blows near Tatoosh and a distant breach of a likely humpback at the west end of Swifsture Bank. The conditions for spotting killer whales was less than ideal with the massive swell so they decided to work their way back along the Vancouver Island shoreline. At 1355 they both received a report that J pod had been found near Constance Bank west bound.

We headed across the strait toward a couple of blows near Halibut Island that turned out to be a pair of humpbacks. Another humpback had traveled up mid-Haro Strait through the southern residents a little earlier. A pair of killer whales did show up off Halibut Island but they were being extremely hard to follow and were taking long dives. These two turned out to be J44 and J53 although J53 snuck away un-photographed. Another group was forming back across Haro Strait off Kellett Bluff so we headed back that direction. We found a loose and active group that included the J31s, J37s, J46, and J51. The young animals were socializing and rolling around together. L105 was also foraging by himself in the general area. Next, we found J19 a little further offshore by herself. After that we moved back inshore to get L72 and L105 who came together off south Kellett Bluff. Several whales including the J22s and members of the J16s and L47s were spread out and foraging deep in Mitchell Bay and we had to wait for them to pass before we could return to Snug Harbor.

The weather was nice so Dave headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1430. Dave arrived on scene about a mile north of Tumbo Island at 1520 to find J pod, the L47s, L72s, L90, and L87 heading slowly southeast towards East Point. They had been reported to have been really spread out earlier but had begun forming up in groups prior to arrival. Now there were several tight groups coming together to form one big loose group. There were a few peripheral whales too and two of these were J19 and J39 who were about a quarter mile to the south of the main group. J19 and J39 were traveling together and appeared to be socializing. They would join the main group a short time later. The whales in the large, main group were also being social as there were lots of breaches, tail lobs, spyhops, and other splashing and rolling behaviors going on. Several adult and sub-adult males were rough-housing near the rear of the group. As the whales approached East Point, they stalled out in the Boiling Reef area and fanned out some. Several peripheral whales began actively foraging and a few fish chases were seen while many of the other whales continued socializing. The whales moved in closer to the Saturna Island shoreline for a while before pointing due south towards Sandy Point on Waldron Island. Most of the whales remained in one large loose group but some whales split off. An active little group consisting of J31, J56, J46, and J53 moved ahead of the main group and were over a half mile to the south of them by the end of the encounter. J19 and J39 must have stayed close to the Saturna shoreline as they were briefly spotted spread out well over a mile to the southwest of the main group. J16 and J42 made a brief appearance early in the encounter with the main group but then remained scarce throughout the rest of it. They showed up near the end traveling quietly by themselves a half mile to the west of main group. The encounter ended at 1700 about halfway between Monarch Head and Skipjack Island with most of the whales still traveling slowly south towards Sandy Point on Waldron Island.
L90 had the same noticeably sway-backed look and stiff surfacing motion that she had in 2011 and 2013 when we believed she was going through a difficult pregnancy. However, she was in the thick of things, socially, throughout the encounter and was one of the whales seen actively chasing a fish. We will continue to monitor her condition in future encounters with hopes she has a healthy calf this time.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2019encounters/2019-88

He heard that the other group was confirmed as the T123's but decided to continue on to take a look in case there were other individuals around.
He could see a few commercial whale watch boats t with the T123's on the north side of Constance Bank as he exited the harbour so swung out around them to the south east and headed south. T049C was reported to have been last seen heading south east a few miles south of the group. The visibility was not ideal as there was moderate rain with a south east wind so after a quick stop with some humpbacks south of Constance Bank he decided to head to the T123's who were traveling north east towards Trial Island before the last of the whale watch boats left them.

As we were approaching the scene with the main group several miles south of Discovery Island, a whale watch vessel reported that a few whales had split off from the others and were now heading west. Before we left, we had heard that a few rarer Ts, formally known as CA166, CA173, and CA173A, were present along with several of our more regular T groups. These three whales had been coming in the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the Fall and Winter the last several years but they had never made it east of the Victoria waterfront. We caught up to the west bound whales south of the Victoria waterfront at about 1430. This was indeed CA166, CA173, and CA173A who had recently been given the West Coast transient designations T251, T252, and T253. The threesome were slowly west bound and we left them at about 1455 to head for the other whales.
We got on the first of the other groups around 1520 about four or five miles to the southeast of the T252s. The T37As were the southern most group with the T49As and T123s about three quarters of a mile to the north of them. T123A left the group he was with before we got there and steamed south past our bow toward the T37As. The rest of the T49As and T123s traveled slowly southeast in a loose group. We left this group at about 1535. Another group was about two miles to the east of the T49As and T123s and this ended up being the T35As, T99s, and T38A. The whales were in a tight group heading quickly east toward the south end of Lopez Island. After looking at photos after we got home, it was noticed that T99 had been carrying a dead harbor porpoise by the tail. We also noted that T38A1 was not present with T38A and the T35As and may now be missing. We left this group at about 1605 and headed toward the T37As who were still several miles to the south.

The conditions weren't ideal as there was a moderate south east outflow wind against the last of the flood current. Mark arrived offshore of Otter Point and decided this was as far as he wanted to go as the seas were not going to be much fun for the ride back to Victoria. Through his Swarovski binoculars he spotted a westbound bull dorsal fin a couple of miles to the north west of him off of Sheringham Point so decided to continue on with hopes they weren't going too quickly west. He came across J41 first ~ 2.5 nm offshore and could see at least another 8 - 10 individuals spread laterally from just inside 2 miles south of the Sheringham light to at least 3 miles offshore. They were zig zagging around foraging as they worked their way west. It was tough to confirm where the rest of the pod was with the moderate swell and wind and after working back and forth across the swell for close to an hour he felt it was time to return to Victoria as he was able to photograph almost half of J pod even with the less than ideal conditions. Mark felt confident it was only J's present and ended the encounter at 1540.

At 1100 today, 30 September, they were reported heading west in Boundary Pass off East Point, Saturna Island, and shortly later at 1226 they were off Battleship Island, Haro Strait.Ken saw the first whales heading south off the Center for Whale Research at 1321and by 1415 they had mostly passed by very spread out across the Strait. At 1615, Ken departed Snug Harbor in ""Chimo"" to encounter and check on the status of the new baby, J56. As luck would have it, the first photo that he took was of J56 with mom (J31) several miles offshore of False Bay. Whales were spread out over many square miles in small groups in calm water - good conditions for photo-ID except that the whales were so spread. Some whales were foraging with gusto, and some were seeming very relaxed - not in tight resting groups at first, but gradually they seemed to come together in groups of increasing size. The groups were all still several miles apart as they oozed offshore from San Juan Island toward the Strait of Juan de Fuca. By sunset it was still not apparent whether they were on their way back out to the ocean. However, the next day on 1 October a large group of SRKWs including the L12s was reported heading west at Jordan River at 1133. The L12s were not with this group of J,K, and L whales that had spent much of the recent two weeks in the interior waters of the Salish Sea, and we presume that they met up in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Thus we know exactly how many SRKWs were in the interior Salish Sea and for how many days. They looked well fed and were feeding, so we can calculate roughly how many pounds of prey species they might have consumed. If we want all of the SRKW to come into these waters for half of the days of the year as they used to, we can calculate roughly how many fish should be allotted to them for that purpose.

Dave, Kathy, and Stewart met at Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 0940. We found whales heading north at Bellevue Point at 0953. This was most of the L4s and they milled around near Bellevue Point for the next 35 minutes. The whales would look like they turned around and pointed south but we were drifting north toward the County Park with the tide. Several whales did brief stints of logging. One of these logging whales, just a little south of the bulk of the L4s, finally arched and she turned out to be L54. L108 and L117 also appeared. The L54s had not made it all the way into inside waters since January.
By about 1030, the L4s and L54s had all joined up and began a determined effort to head down San Juan Island in a tight group. 25 minutes later, the Ls were only halfway between Bellevue Point and Lime Kiln, although the L54s had split off from the L4s and were traveling south just a little southwest of them. L108 began chasing a salmon and his little brother L117 came over to help. We left the L54s at 1110, still north of Lime Kiln, to head to whales that we heard were down island. About a mile and a half off Hannah Heights, we found L83 and then we found L88 foraging by himself another three quarters of a mile offshore of her. Moving on from L88, we found L72 and L105 off False Bay. Farther south off South Beach, we found members of K pod extremely spread out. We could only find K21, K35, and K42 down there although we caught a glimpse of K26 but he disappeared without being photographed.
We headed back north and found K33, first fishing and then heading south, just a little south of False Bay. Next was L88 again, still foraging by himself a couple miles offshore of the south end of False Bay. A little while later we saw K37 inshore at the south end of False Bay and K12 and probably K43 were ahead of him by a quarter mile, all heading south. Ahead of them, closer to Eagle Point, we found the L54s again heading south. On our way home we passed a large tight group off False Bay heading south that included the L4s, L47s, and L72s.

There was no fog so between the two boats this would maximize the search effort for the Southern Residents.
At 1012 Mark spotted killer whales north bound 3.5 miles south of the mouth of the Nitinat River.
The first whale he identified was K20 and could see that they were spread out over at least 2 miles. They were traveling on a line from Swiftsure Bank towards the Vancouver Island shoreline.

He could also see and few many other humpbacks spread out throughout the area. At 0935 he left it with Ken and crew on Springtime after spending an hour with it as repeatedly breached, tail lobbed, waved and slapped its pectoral fins.
Mark then headed east towards Sombrio as the fog had diminished dramatically to the east and at 1025 as he approached Sombrio Point he entered a fog bank. At the same time he received a VHF call from a whale watch colleague Peter Zelen that he had come across westbound killer whales 7 miles to the east ~1 nm south of Magdelana Point. Peter confirmed that they were indeed members of J pod so Mark slowed down and kept an extra sharp lookout as the visibility was now reduced to less than a quarter mile. At 1036 he came across K22 3 miles west south west of Peter’s whales (48 24.6/124 15.1). He could see more inshore as the fog lifted and worked through the group eventually coming across a large trailing group inshore which included members of the L4’s and the J11’s. Springtime arrived within an hour and picked up the lead K pod animals and were able to collect several ID’s that Mark had missed. By now the fog had lifted completely so they were able to confidently confirm which individuals were present.
At 1330 Mark left Springtime and headed west to see if the rest of L pod was around. He worked his way out the middle of the Juan de Fuca Strait south of Carmanah Point when he decided to investigate probable humpback whale blows near Cape Flattery. After confirming that only humpback whales were in that area (48 25.7/124 42.7) he worked his way towards Swiftsure Bank and came across a group of ~ 10 humpacks with a group of steller sealions 7 miles east of the bank. He continued west towards Swiftsure Bank and watched another animated humpback repeatedly breach at the edge of the fog bank to the west. The fog started to roll in thick from the west so Mark decided to head back to the east to stay in the clear and re sight the lead K’s.

The air temperature was dropping quickly as a low lying cloud came from the north and wisps of fog began to roll in, so the encounter was ended and ""Chimo"" headed back to Snug Harbor, having accomplished the mission of documenting the new baby.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2019encounters/2019-58

A group including the T10s and the T109As, who were a few miles southwest of Trial Island, sparked Dave’s interest as CWR does not get to encounter the T109As very often. The T46Bs had also been seen in the area. Dave headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1600.
“Orcinus” arrived on scene at 1655 about six to seven miles southeast of Trial Island to find most of the boats watching all the T46Bs traveling east in a tight group. Dave stayed with the T46Bs for less than ten minutes before inquiring about the whereabouts of the T10s and T109As. There had been an inflatable about a mile and a half to the southeast of the T46Bs who reported he was with a few whales where he was before he left. This was in the area the T10s and T109As had last been seen traveling southeast. Dave headed down that way to see inf the other Ts would show up. After moving to that area, Dave turned off the engine to listen for blows. Shortly afterwards, a blow was heard to the southwest of “Orcinus” and whales were seen soon after that. So that was where the T10s and T109As went too! Except, upon approach, it became clear that it was not the T10s and T109As-especially after the male T69C surfaced next to the boat. These whales were the T69s and the T37As and they were milling and socializing about a mile and half or more south of the T46Bs. CWR sees the T69s even less often than they see the T109As. Most of the females and juveniles remained in one tight group that appeared to be socializing as they headed slowly east. T69C, T69E, and T37A2 were vigorously socializing about a quarter mile to the southwest of the other T37As and T69s. There was a lot of rolling and inverted whales in this threesome and they socialized with one another for the rest of the encounter. The encounter ended at 1810 about eight or so miles south of Seabird Point with the threesome still socializing between a quarter and a half mile south of the rest of the T37As and T69s who where now about two miles to the southwest of the T46Bs.

Several whales were seen foraging deep into Mitchell Bay and off the mouth of Open Bay. J53 was seen playing with a piece of kelp all by herself-tossing it in the air and vocalizing above the surface. J pod headed slowly around Kellett Bluff and the encounter ended at 1130.

T137A was moving very slowly and his dorsal fin tip appeared long before he would surface to breathe. When he surfaced, he would arch his head up ever so slightly. The other three T137s milled around him and then continued heading slowly east with T137A following a short distance behind. Around 1140, T137A formed up with the rest of the T137s and they traveled slowly in a tight foursome. T137A would sometimes take an extra breath or two after the other three whales went down on a long dive.

After several minutes, the T137s came up from a long dive and appeared to be in the middle of a kill although we were too far away to see what they got. T137 and T137B moved on ahead after the kill was over while T137A and T137D stayed behind to feed for another 6-7 minutes. The T137s continued slowly east and T137A fell up to a half mile behind the other three before they came back to T137A at about 1345. The whales milled around and were in a loose group still pointed east just a little west of Clover Point when we ended the encounter at 1355.

While something was definitely wrong with T137A’s behavior, how he looked physically was a lot harder to judge. T137A, at least in his teenage years, has historically had a different appearance than most transients. He lacks the big mound of blubber behind the blow hole that most transients have which makes his back come to a pinnacle halfway between the blowhole and dorsal fin. This look also gives him a flattened area behind the blow hole. While this look can change with the roll of the whale so he looks fatter, the scary, skinny look can also be exaggerated when he bobs his head as he surfaces. Included in the encounter summary are three photos of T137A from previous years that show he can give off these skinnier looks at various times and angles. We hope to see the T137s again in the next week or so to see if there is any change in T137A’s behavior and body condition.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2019encounters/2019-55

There were also several groups of transients scattered about the central Salish Sea. The rain just about stopped by 1430 and we made an attempt to encounter the SRs coming in off the Victoria waterfront. We made it out into the middle of Haro Strait but a breeze had now picked up and it looked really, really wet where the whales probably were so we turned around and headed back home.
By about 1730, the sky had cleared up and the water had calmed down so Dave and Michael made another attempt to encounter the Ks and Ls. Lodie had reported whales off Eagle Point and others were reported to be still coming in at Middle Bank. We left Snug Harbor at 1800 and saw our first whales at 1820 near Kanaka Bay. We caught a glimpse of L47 and L115 milling before they disappeared and we moved on farther south. At the south end of False Bay, we found L103 and L123 who were heading south into deteriorating sea conditions. Due to reports of a wind line heading north from the south end of the island and 2-3 foot roll coming in from the west, we decided it would probably be a good idea to be heading home so we headed back north. We found L82 and L116 heading south off Pile Point, got a couple of quick pictures, and kept heading north.
We found the southbound J pod whales at 1915 less than a mile south of Kellett Bluff off the mouth of Mitchell Bay and spread out across Haro Strait.

Despite this, whale watch boats were catching occasionally glimpses of the whales as they headed north up the west side of SJI. Dave saw his first whale at about 1105. This was J36 somewhere near Land Bank and she soon disappeared again into the fog. There was a just enough of a break in the fog near Bellevue Point to see the leading whales turn around and head back down island into the fog again. Around 1150 near shore, somewhere around Pile Point, J36 showed up in the fog with J16. These two traveled south for about five minutes before J26 showed up in the gloom just ahead of them. The three of them continued south for another seven minutes or so before being lost in the fog again a little southwest of False Bay.

They entered fog slightly east of Sombrio Point, so they stopped to listen for blows. The occasional single blow could be heard, so they continued a bit further west and stopped to listen again. More blows could be heard slightly to the northwest, so they continued another mile in that direction. The fog cleared up, and they came across a large concentration of humpbacks at 48 27.0/124 22.5 _~30 individuals. After getting most of their flukes photographed, they decided to continue west towards Swiftsure Bank taking advantage of the near-perfect conditions with minimal swell and wind. As they approached the western entrance to the Juan de Fuca, there was a moderate southwest breeze with a 2 - 3-foot chop. They tacked off towards the south edge of the bank and came across a small aggregation of humpbacks 7 miles southeast of the bank (48 30.1/124 50.1) and were certain they saw a breaching killer whale as they approached that area. After several minutes they concluded that it must have been a small humpback so continued on. Once reaching the southeast corner of the bank, they took a tack across the eastern edge of the bank on a line for the Nitinat river mouth. As they went north, the seas flattened out. When they got within 5 miles of the Vancouver Island shoreline and had a good scan before they took a line to the southeast. Bingo! At 1415 they spotted killer whales on the bow at 48 35.4/124 51.9 (~4.5 nm southwest of Carmanah). We quickly confirmed that we were seeing members of the Southern Residents and that representatives of all three pods were present and from the spread, we guessed that the entire clan was there. We were able to find J31 with her new calf J56 as well as L77's calf L124 that was first identified by CWR in January near Constance Bank when the entire clan was last observed on the inside. They all continued on a line towards the Vancouver Island shoreline spread from the mouth of the Nitinat river to slightly west of Carmanah.

On approaching them, the distinctive fin of T77A was evident, so it was worth a few minutes to check the whales out for identification. The whales were heading toward Dungeness Spit, and they spread out over several square miles after in what seemed to be a hunting pattern. They were diving for about ten minutes and surfacing facing briefly in various directions, but generally trending southeast. When a female and calf group allowed one close approach for photo-identification. T34A, a twelve year old female, had a very young calf accompanying her. That is around the age at which young female killer whales typically have their first-born. The Bigg's Transient baby boom continues, with an abundance of food - many seals and porpoises in this area!

My very first encounter with J pod was in Admiralty Inlet in April 1976, long before their current popularity, and I hoped for a repeat of a pattern that we have observed with J pod traveling the waters of the Salish Sea in late winter/early spring. K and L pods mostly travel the coastal waters with occasional forays to inland waters when Chinook salmon migrate to their natal rivers to spawn. L pod was off the coast of central California last week, feeding upon Sacramento River Chinook salmon that were aggregating from Monterey to Half Moon Bay. K pod is yet to be located, but no doubt they are either looking for or finding salmon. I expected them all to potentially be coming this way any day soon. Unbeknown to me, J pod had slipped into the Admiralty Inlet during the previous afternoon/evening and in the morning was reported between Kingston and Edmonds, very spread out and not going anywhere. The salmon fishing for winter blackmouth (Chinook) had been pretty good lately, with most fish being 6-8 pounds and big ones up to 13 pounds, so I hoped to see if the whales were also getting in on the “bite”.
My plan thus quickly changed from simply moving the boat to breaking in the new engine – running at various speeds for several hours, and attempting to encounter J pod for a quick check on J17. We left Point Hudson at 1220 and headed down the Inlet at various medium speeds, and encountered the first whale one hour later near the northwest edge of the Possession Point “Bar”. The whale, L87, and a fishing buddy that I took to be J49 were taking very long dives and travelling hundreds of yards up and down the Inlet, with gradual progress to the northwest. For half an hour, I saw no other whales before spotting another male fin briefly about a mile south of us. Long dives, changing directions, and brief no-saddle appearances at the surface were the pattern of the day for the whales for the next hour and a half – uneventful, except that a group that we found included J17, J44, J46, and J53, that I had hoped to see. J17 has improved and showed little sign of the “peanut-head” condition that had us very worried during an encounter with her on New Year’s Eve. At 1538, J42 appeared in the vicinity of this group, and gradually more whales began to show up spread out and travelling very slowly up the Inlet toward Double Bluff. By 1608, most of J pod was in an area of about six square miles in the middle of Admiralty Inlet, with many whales at the southerly end of the assemblage engaging in social contact and occasionally (and lazily) lobtailing as they moved gradually up the Inlet. A half a mile or so up the Inlet a few whales were also lazily lobtailing at the surface as they gradually moved down the Inlet. The assemblage gradually coalesced and then headed back down the Inlet toward the Possession Bar. After they surfaced and dove again, I checked out a few of the swirls of whale “tracks” looking for prey remains and scale samples, but saw none. A few small glittery specks were deep in the water column, and I presume any feeding was done near the bottom where blackmouth salmon are usually caught ten feet above the bottom in this region. We left the whales at 1624 as they headed back toward the Bar where the sport fishing fleet was working the incoming tide.
On the morning of 8 April, 2019 J pod was observed heading up Haro Strait passing Lime Kiln lighthouse on San Juan Island as they continued their widely spread foraging expedition in the Salish Sea (the report of J pod in Puget Sound was sent to me by Alisa Lemire-Brooks). Judging by the time they spend in these inland marine waters, this habitat is a more important feeding area to them than it is to K or L pods that now rarely venture into the region. We will continue to keep track of all of the SRKWs that come into these core waters, and we also photo-document the Transient groups that now increasingly frequent the Salish Sea. Between Orca Network and their public sighting system, the marine naturalists of the Pacific Whale Watch Association, and our Center for Whale Research will document the whale distribution and condition in a changing world climate that will have a huge effect on the Pacific Northwest. Already, the effects are being felt with temperatures unfavorable to their salmon prey, and ocean acidification destroying the food chain due to excessive atmospheric CO2 from burning fossil fuels. These iconic animals are the canaries in the coal mine for the marine species that our life depends upon, and it is only common sense that we humans do whatever natural salmon recovery is necessary for their survival, rather than wasting money and concern over ephemeral noise issues and government agendas that are impossible to honestly evaluate. We absolutely know that SRKW survival is directly correlated with Chinook salmon abundance, and we also know that native wild salmon will ultimately provide the only path to salmon recovery. The only question is will we remove the dams blocking their natural lifecycle and restore habitats necessary for native salmon recovery,… before it is too late?",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2019encounters/2019-25

As the day went on, all the groups eventually came together in the Thatcher Pass area of Rosario Strait. Melisa met Tom and Jane at Snug Harbor and left the dock at 1425 aboard “Morning Star”. At 1525, “Morning Star” arrived on scene in Rosario Strait with T46D, who was quickly heading north alone on the east side of Blakely Island. There were two more northbound groups about a quarter of a mile behind T46D, one closer to the middle of Rosario Strait (the T36Bs, T99s, and T137A), and another group farther to the west, closer to the Blakely Island shoreline (the T36As and T49As). Soon after, the T36As and T49As turned to the east, moving closer to the middle of the strait and the other group. The two groups then came together and stalled out to socialize. Many spy hops, aerial scans, half breaches, tail slaps, and pec slaps were observed. Some of the whales were also very tactile with each other.

At 1645, more whales were spotted to the south, east of Thatcher Pass. “Morning Star” headed that way and found the T46s (minus T46D) and T137s (minus T137A) all grouped up and slowly milling about, seemingly waiting for T46D and T137A to rejoin them. “Morning Star” stayed for a few surfacings before heading back to the big social group. The big social group had since split into three groups and fanned out. The T49As, T99B, and T99C were now heading slowly south as they continued to socialize while the T36As and T36Bs were still slowly heading north as they goofed off and playfully pushed T36B’s calf around at the surface. The third group was made up of T36, T99, T99D, and T137A and they had formed a resting line behind the T36As and T36Bs. Eventually T36, T99, T99D, and T137A turned south and the T36As and T36Bs slowly followed after them.

By 1730, all of the groups had trickled back into the same area outside of Thatcher Pass. The T46s had arrived from the east and T46D had apparently re-joined the rest of the family at some point. The T49As, T99B, and T99C arrived from the north first, then T36, T99, T99D, and T137A. The T36As and T36Bs brought up the rear and all the whales slowly meandered west toward to the entrance to Thatcher Pass. The T49As then split from the other whales and headed into Thatcher Pass. When this happened, the rest of the whales turned around and headed south in Rosario Strait, hugging the James Island shoreline as they went. The encounter ended at 1805.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2019encounters/2019-24

Dave grabbed his gear, headed to the boat, and left Snug Harbor around 1145ish. “Orcinus” got to the general area in Boundary Pass around 1215 but the whales were so spread out that it was 1230 before the first whales were seen and encountered.

The first group encountered was J36, J41, and J51 and they were about halfway between Blunden Island and Johns Pass. The threesome were socializing as they fast traveled east toward White Rock. About a half mile to the south of these three, J19 and J39 were paralleling each other-spread by about 200 yards-as they also fast traveled east. A male appeared way up ahead in the White Rocks area. This turned out to be J26. J27 also appeared another half mile east of J26 and both of them foraged separately in the area between White Rock and Flattop Island.
More whales were seen closer to the Orcas Island shoreline and this turned out to be the J17s, J22s and J40. This group was loosely stretched out as they turned southwest and then filed around the north and west shorelines of Jones Island. J17 herself was present with J53 beside her with the others near Jones Island. Most of the group began milling as they headed slowly southeast on the south side of Jones while J17 began traveling down San Juan Channel by herself a couple of hundred yards ahead of the others. J53 stayed to play with the group. J17 did not have bad breath when the research boat was near her on this day but that may have been a matter of wind direction. L87 and the J37s appeared as they also rounded Jones Island about a quarter mile behind the others and soon joined the milling whales.

A single whale was seen a few hundred yards to the northwest of the Jones Island group and another group had formed just a little north of O’Neil Island. The single whale turned out to be J45 and he traveled slowly southeast mid-channel by himself until angling toward the whales near Jones Island. By 1445, the J17s, J22s, J14s, and L87 group were only about half a mile southeast of Jones Island before they had turned around and began heading slowly back to the northwest. “Orcinus” headed over to the group north of O’Neal Island and found it to include the J16s, J19s, and J39. These whales were grouped up tight and heading slowly north. Due to an annoying cloud that made things dark (“old man yells at cloud”) plus the whales weren’t arching much, just a few proof of presence shots were taken of this group at the time before moving back to the other group.

The J16s and J19s group had passed Green Point by 1600 and were now traveling west on the north side of Spieden Island. This group had lost J39 but gained J27 and J31. Right before the Cactus Islands, these whales turned north and traveled slowly in a tight group back into Boundary Pass. The rest of J pod and L87 were about three quarters of a mile to the southeast of the J16s, J19s, and J11s and were still spread out in singles and small groups. There was a lot socializing going on in the trailing groups. J39 was actively going after J40 with L87 lingering nearby. J35 breached twice in a row. J38 was playing with some of the younger whales while bringing up the rear. The encounter ended at 1705 about a mile north of the east end of Johns Island with all the whales still heading slowly north in Boundary Pass.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2019encounters/2019-23

Dave and Melisa headed to Snug Harbor and left the dock at 1230 aboard “Orcinus”. At 1240, “Orcinus” arrived on scene about two miles southeast of Mandarte Island. J pod was very spread out in small groups and still slowly heading south.

J37, J49, and L87 surfaced a few hundred yards south of “Orcinus” in a loose group. J22 and J38 were then spotted near each other about a quarter of a mile to the north. When blows were seen a few hundred yards to the northeast of J22 and J38 at 1300, “Orcinus” went to investigate. Amazingly, the blows came from J17 and J53! J17 was still alive and had even improved a little in body condition since December/January. However, her breath still smelled awful so the CWR will remain cautiously optimistic that she will survive.

As J17 and J53 approached Kellet Bluffs on Henry Island, “Orcinus” headed off to look for other whales. After a few repeat whales, more groups were found half a mile north of Kelp Reefs at 1352. The largest group was made up of the J19s, J31, the J35s, J40, and J46. J16, J36, and J42 paralleled the larger group a few hundred yards to the west and slightly trailing behind them were J26 and J27. As the whales slowly headed south past Kelp Reefs at 1428, J26 joined J16, J36, and J42 while J27 headed over to the larger group.

The whales were reported to still be in Boundary Pass and heading toward Sandy Point on Waldron Island at 1645. At 1730, “Morning Star” arrived on scene on the west side of Waldron Island. The whales were spread out in small groups and pointing southeast.

The T101s and others were seen off in the distance in Cowlitz Bay while two other groups were approaching White Rock. “Morning Star” headed to the White Rock groups when a small calf was spotted, then two! The first calf belonged to the T36As and had already been documented by Mark Malleson on a DFO research trip earlier in March. The other calf belonged to the T36Bs and was first observed in January.

The T36As and T36Bs paralleled each other by a few hundred yards as they passed White Rock and then quickly turned north into President Channel. The T36Bs moved closer to the Waldron Island shoreline while the T36As trailed slightly behind to the east. Up ahead, the T101s and others could be seen up against Waldron and quickly heading north. “Morning Star” moved north to investigate and found the T101s trailing a few hundred yards behind the T99s and T124A1. When T99s and T124A1 slowed down, the T101s moved offshore and passed them. The T36Bs then re-appeared a few hundred yards behind the T99s and T124A1.

At 1500, a report came in of killer whales, possibly J pod, outside of Porlier Pass. Luckily, “Morning Star” was not too far away and arrived on scene at 15:15. The whales were spread out across Georgia Strait as they traveled south a few miles east of Valdes and Galiano Islands.

The first whale to be confirmed was J27 and he wasn’t in any hurry as he swam along. A few hundred yards to the east of him were J19 and J41, associating with each other occasionally and also in travel mode. To the east of them were J42 and J51 and they were more grouped up. At one point, J42 and J51 found a salmon and worked together to try to catch it. They may have caught it in the end but it was not entirely clear. J36 passed by J42 and J51 just before they had started foraging but quickly backtracked and joined up with them right after they had either caught the salmon or lost it.

At 1610, J16 and J26 was spotted foraging together to the east. Soon after, J31 and J39 were found near each other even further east.

At 1120, a whale watching boat found whales heading west in Trincomali Channel. “Morning Star” headed that way and arrived on scene west of Parker Island at 1200. The first whale encountered was T2C2, who has severe scoliosis. He was slowly heading north and trailing behind the rest of the whales by 3/4 of a mile. “Morning Star” took a few proof of presence shots of T2C2 before heading to the northern whales.

The other whales turned out to be the rest of T2C2’s family and the T123s. They were quickly moving north (7-9 knots) west of Wise Island. Males T2C1 and T123A were rolling around together while the rest of the two families were grouped up a few hundred yards to the north. “Morning Star” continued north to get photos of the remaining members of the T2Cs and T123s as they took the east side of Wallace Island. Occasionally, the T2Cs and T123s would pause and log at the surface for a few minutes. Perhaps they were waiting for T2C2 to catch up but he was still trailing far behind them.

Suddenly, another group of whales appeared a few hundred yards to the west. It was the T49As in a resting line and “Morning Star” saw these whales briefly before they disappeared from view as they slowly headed north on the west side of Wallace Island. At 1255, “Morning Star” left the T2Cs and T123s to get better proof of presence shots of the T49As. The T49As had continued north through Houstoun Passage and were taking ten minute long deep dives.

After spotting them, the Cogans went out on their boat “Morning Star” with Melisa Pinnow aboard and called again to say that they had identified the whales as the T10s and T2Cs and that they were heading north near Gooch Island. Dave grabbed his gear, headed for the boat, and left Snug Harbor a little before noon.
“Orcinus” arrived on scene around 1220 where the T10s and the T2Cs, minus T2C2 and T2C3, were traveling slowly north tight to the east shoreline of Moresby Island. Several whales from this group stopped and briefly logged at the surface. After a long dive, the whales moved more into the middle of lower Swanson Channel and began to wake up a bit. T10 did two big cartwheels and T2C did one. A whale appeared from the north and this turned out to be T2C3. T2C3 logged briefly at the surface about a quarter of a mile north of the other whales when all the whales went on another long dive. When the whales came up again, T2C3 had re-joined the group and everybody continued north.
“Morning Star” had left the scene a while ago and had gone on a whale search up Boundary Pass toward East Point. A bit before 1300, they found the T49As near East Point heading quickly southwest down Boundary Pass. “Orcinus” left the T2Cs and T10s at about 1310 in mid-Swanson Channel to head over to where the T49As were in Boundary Pass, arriving on scene mid-way between Blunden Island and Johns Pass twenty minutes later. South of South Pender Island, the whales turned west with T49A1 about a half mile to the south of the other T49As. All the T49As were traveling fast and T49A1 was on a converging course with the others. T49A1 joined the rest of the T49As by the time they turned north at the south end of Swanson Channel.
By this time, we had heard that the T2Cs and T10s had turned around and were heading south again in Swanson Channel. At 1400, the T49As had slowed down and were traveling in a tight group just a little north of Moresby Island. The T10s and T2Cs were briefly seen logging at the surface north of the T49As off Mouat Point before they went on a long dive. Suddenly four or five new whales appeared heading south about three quarters of a mile north of the T49As and then all the whales went on a long dive. After an extremely long long dive, all the whales came up a good distance away heading very quickly southeast toward the Pender Bluffs. Almost all the whales were in one single socializing group close in to the dark rocks of the bluff. T19B and T19C were identified so now we knew at least the T18s had joined up with the others. T2C2 also appeared well offshore of the others where he kept a low profile. The large group traveled along the rocks as they came down the bluffs, crossed the Bedwell Harbor entrance, and moved east along South Pender Island’s south shoreline. The T10s reappeared traveling almost a half mile behind the large group. T49A1 had moved offshore by himself and appeared to be foraging. T2C2 also showed up traveling slowly all by himself another quarter mile behind the T10s.

We arrived on scene at about 1530 in Spieden Channel. The whales, already identified as the T90s and T101s, were traveling slowly west near the southeastern shoreline of Spieden Island. Most of the whales were in one tight group with T101A being the lone outlier traveling a couple of hundred yards ahead of the others. The whales moved a little offshore as they moved west. When they were adjacent to Sentinel Island, they began to wake up and T101B did a big belly flop which he followed with a half breach.
Soon after, the whales started to loosen up and began feeding on something. They may have made an inconspicuous kill then but there is also chance that the whales had killed a sea lion prior to our arrival and were carrying it for most of the way through Spieden Channel before feeding upon it. We never did get a good look at what they killed but the whales were feeding and socializing in the same area around the west end of Spieden Island for over an hour and a half. Since the whales weren’t going anywhere, much of the encounter was spent with the engine off while the whales milled around.

T101A and T101B were hanging out together around the periphery of the group with occasional forays into the middle of the action. At one point, the two brothers were seen with a large chunk of something while the other whales were feeding on something else a short distance away. Throughout the encounter there were lots of taillobs and other percussive behavior. T90C breached several times and, later in the encounter, was spyhopping repeatedly. Towards the end, the whales were socializing and acting quite confident.

She then called back a half hour later to relay a report that whales had been seen heading north near Lime Kiln. Dave grabbed his stuff and headed first to the County Park to take a look from shore. At least one whale was seen way offshore of the park and “Sea Lion” came from the north and slowed down for something offshore of CWR. Jeanne Hyde reported seeing a small group of whales to the southwest of the leaders. Dave then headed on to Snug Harbor and left in the boat around 1550.
As “Orcinus” putted out of the harbor, “Sea Lion” was seen nearing Kellett Bluff and Ken was also out in “Tonto”. “Orcinus” headed southwest out of Mitchell Bay to try to find the group Jeanne had seen. Jane called on the radio to report that the three whales who had passed her place were the J19s and that was who was probably near Kellett Bluff. After about 20 minutes of searching, Dave finally saw his first whale mid-strait off Mitchell Bay. This was J39 who foraged a little before passing the boat and continuing north. There were no other whales in sight so “Orcinus” headed in the direction of Kelp Reef. After another fifteen minutes, a small group was seen about three quarters of a mile to the north of Kelp Reef. This was J16, J36, J42, and J31 traveling in a group together. At least two males and a possible third whale could now be seen spread back across the strait off the south end of Mitchell Bay. All the whales were taking extremely long dives and were easy to miss when they finally came up again. Dave overshot the nearest male who was at least a half mile to the southeast of the small group and went to see the far male instead. This was J27 and he was foraging about a mile off Kellett Bluff.

Dave and Melisa headed to Snug Harbor and left the dock at 1415 aboard “Orcinus”. At 1454, “Orcinus” arrived on scene with the J16s about three-quarters of a mile west of the Patos Island lighthouse. J16, J36, and J42 were traveling east tight together. J26 was paralleling them a few hundred yards to the north and swam over to join them soon after.

To the north, the rest of J pod was spread out but slowly coming together into social groups as they also headed east. At 1538, “Orincus” left the J16s as they took the southern side of Patos Island and headed over to the rest of the pod, which took the northern side. The largest of the social groups was made up of J19, J22, J37, J38, J41, and J49. They were less than a quarter of a mile from the Patos shoreline and were surface active with occasional tail slaps, pec slaps, and spy hops. It wasn’t long until J27, J31, and J39 joined the larger group from further inshore. Goofing off and trailing slightly behind were J40, J45, and J51.

J40, J45, and J51 caught up with the larger group (which now contained all of the J11s, J14s, J19s, and J22s) as it neared Toe Point and many of the whales became more surface active with frequent tail slaps, inverted tail slaps, and pec slaps. At 1605, the J11s, J14s, J19s, and J22s cleared Patos Island and continued east toward Lummi Island. The J16s had also cleared Patos by this time and could be seen in the distance to the south, also aiming toward Lummi.

At 1618, the J16s joined the J11s, J14s, J19s, and J22s and they all turned south toward President Channel, though they seemed a bit indecisive about it at first. The encounter was ended at 1631 as the whales slowly swam south along the Sucia Island shoreline toward Present Channel.

We saw our first whale at 1125 about a mile or so south of Kelp Reef. The whales were extremely spread out over the Canadian side of the strait and we only saw a few individuals and one small group. All the whales we could see were heading southerly toward Beaumont Shoal and Seabird Point on Discovery Island. The first whale we saw was L115 before we moved to a distant small group that included L72, L105, L90, and L103. So, we had at least the group of 18 L pod whales that included the L4, L47, and L72 matrilines plus L90. Since the other whales were so sparse and hard to find, plus the lack of any males larger than L105, it made us suspect that these 18 Ls were the only residents here. Most of the whales were taking long dives and a few distant individuals looked like they could be foraging.
A little after we left the group of four, we found L83 and L110 but other whales were still just singles in the distance until we started to approach Seabird Point. As we had expected, the distant animals started to funnel together as they approached Seabird Point around 1245. All the other L4s appeared along with our L72s, L90, and L103 group. As the whales rounded Seabird Point, they turned southwest and traveled toward Trial Island in several small groups. Other than a small tight group of L4s, the whales began to spread out again as they crossed the Oak Bay flats.

The whales were very spread out and traveling slowly west. K21 and the K20s were the first whales encountered and seemed to be the most northerly and westerly of the whales.

After looking all over, and seeing a few more spread out whales like the K27s, Dave was able to get on K25 with the help of “Strong Tide” who re-found him and called Dave over. Upon approach, K25 surfaced from a very long, long dive and seemed to be foraging. He soon straightened out and headed west-surfacing many times in a row, cooperatively, and Dave was able to get the shots he needed before it was time to leave due to failing light. The encounter ended with K25 heading west south of the Victoria waterfront at 1615. While K25 did not look 100% healthy, neither did it look like his health worsened much since we last received really good photos of him from October 12th.

The goal was to find L pod. Both K and L pod were seen in Puget Sound the previous day and L pod was of particular interest because there appeared to be a new calf. “Morning Star” headed straight to Admiralty Inlet. Not long after, J pod was seen heading toward Discovery Island/Constance Bank area from the west side of San Juan Island.

“Morning Star” spotted blows at the northern end of Admiralty Inlet at 0930, about a mile northeast of Point Wilson. It was all of K pod sleepily traveling northwest in a tight group. Everyone was accounted for, including K25. K25 remains thin, but it appears that his condition has not worsened.

It wasn’t long until more blows were seen a few hundred yards behind K pod. It was all of L pod grouped up and also slowly heading northwest. “Morning Star” moved from K pod to L pod to find the new calf. All of L pod was accounted for and L77’s new calf, L124, was confirmed at 0950. The calf appeared to be about 3 weeks old and was bouncing around between L25, L41, L77 L85, and L119. A gender was not revealed during the encounter but there will hopefully be more opportunities in the future.

Multiple social groups formed in L pod and many of the males, both young and old, were especially playful. As L pod exited Admiralty Inlet, even more whales became surface active with tail slaps, pec slaps, cartwheels, breaches, and spy hops. Up ahead, K pod had already exited the inlet and was still heading northwest.

By 1030, L pod was 1/3 mile due south of the SA buoy, still heading northwest but had increased their speed to 4-5 knots. K pod remained in a tight group to the west of L pod. Once southeast of Hein Bank, L pod began to disperse into smaller groups and picked their speed up to 6-7 knots. As the Ls were spreading out to the east, some the whales, especially the L4s and L47s, became surface active again. K pod also became surface active off to the west. It was clear that K and L pod could hear J pod and were eager to join them. “Morning Star” stayed with some of the L12s and L54s, but the L54s were not in such a hurry and fell behind.

The new calf kept up well with L25, L41, L77, and L119 as they sped northwest. “Morning Star” then decided to see where K pod went off to and re-acquired almost all of K pod in a tight group at 1310, southeast of Constance Bank. Then, news came in from whale watching boats that J pod was up ahead. K pod became surface active again as they closed the gap between them and J pod. Up ahead, some of Ls, including the L12s, had already reached J pod and were beginning to socialize. K pod arrived on scene soon after and joined the social groups that were forming.

It appeared the all of J pod was around and J17 was seen a few times, though a health shot was not acquired. If all of J pod was indeed there, than all 75 of the endangered southern resident orcas were in the same area together. “Morning Star” moved around the spread out social groups and found some trailing whales that were a little late to the party. Some of the L4s, the L72s, L47s, and the L54s slowly headed toward J, K, and the rest of L pod.

At 1230, a large cluster of blows were spotted to the southwest as “Morning Star” was crossing the shipping lanes west of Mitchell Bay in Haro Strait. The blows turned out to be from J pod and the whales were heading south on the Canadian side of Haro Strait, south of Kelp Reefs.

Nearly all of J pod was grouped up and sleepily heading toward Cadboro Point on Vancouver Island. Not everyone was sleepy though. L87 and J47 were goofing off together, as were J38, J39, and J45. The J16s and J46 were socializing a few hundred yards to the west of the big group. To the east of the big group were J17 and J53. Unfortunately, J17 has not improved in health and showing a true peanuthead now. Perhaps reacting to their mother’s condition, both J35 and J53 were acting mopey.

As J pod approached Vancouver Island, it became clear that they were going to take Baynes Channel instead of going around Seabird Point, Discovery Island. Most of the whales started tail slapping, pec slapping, cartwheeling, and spy hopping as they neared the entrance to Baynes Channel and these behaviors continued into the channel. Interestingly, the whales then entered the Chain Islets and dramatically milled about in shallow water for a little over ten minutes. It was unclear if J pod was fishing, socializing, or stuck among the small rocky islands. J17, J44, and J53 were the first to emerge from the Chain Islets and headed west. The rest of the whales quickly followed after them and headed southwest toward Trial Island.

At about 1150, whales were spotted in Friday Harbor. “Morning Star” was nearby, having searched Spieden and President Channel, and arrived on scene at about 1200. T49A2 and T65A2 were on the south side of the harbor, but changed direction and headed across the harbor to the north side before continuing north to Point Caution.

Melisa was also in Friday Harbor at the time. “Morning Star” picked her up and re-joined the whales at 1230. T49A2 and T65A2 had since crossed San Juan Channel to the Shaw Island shoreline. At one point, T49A2 and T65A2 logged in the current together and drifted along for a few minutes. The whales were pointed toward Lopez Island, but then turned to continue south in San Juan Channel at 1255.

T49A2 and T65A2 remained tight together as they zig-zagged their way down the channel with 5-8 minute down times. They were on the Lopez Island side of the channel first, then moved closer to the San Juan Island side. The whales were nearing Cattle Pass by 1400 and no obvious kills were made in the pass, though there were many opportunities.

The whales exited Cattle Pass and turned to the west for a short distance, before heading back east/southeast. “Morning Star” ended the encounter at 1430 as T49A2 and T65A2 continued southeast from Salmon Bank.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2018encounters/110

Tracking the changing use of this area by both resident and transient (or Bigg’s) killer whales has been a project at the Center for Whale Research for more than 40 years. Although the resident killer whales are typically scarce in the winter months, it is becoming more and more common to find at least one group of transient or Bigg’s killer whales somewhere in the area at this time of year. In addition to killer whales, there are still quite a few humpbacks scattered about the Strait of Juan de Fuca. It is prudent for boaters in this area to always be on the look-out for humpbacks and slow down in their presence because humpbacks are more prone to vessel strike than killer whales. “See a blow, go slow”.

Today’s trip was prompted by killer whale calls on one of the San Juan Island hydrophones. Breaching whales were spotted from shore, on the other side of Haro Strait near Halibut Island. The whales were heading south in Haro Strait.

Morning Star left the dock and headed west toward Kelp Reefs. Blows were spotted in the distance, to the south of Kelp Reefs. The blows belonged to a group of a dozen transient or Bigg’s killer whales: the T35A’s, T38A’s, T75B’s, T75C’s, and T65A4. T35A, T38A, T75B and T75C are mothers of young calves. As for T65A4, based on sighting reports available to the CWR, it appears that T65A4 and the older brother, T65A2, separated from the rest of the T65A's a few months ago. T65A2 has been recently sighted with T49A2 on more than one occasion, but until a few days ago, the whereabouts of T65A4 were a mystery.

These whales made their way south on the Canadian side of Haro Strait, socializing along the way. The whales began to disperse as they headed south, with small groups splitting then re-joining the larger groups.

Morning Star handed the whales off to Mark Malleson on Mike 1. Mark left the whales off Seabird Point on Discovery Island.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2018encounters/109

I then spotted blows a few miles to the south and west with the Swarovski's that I wasn't convinced were humpbacks. Joe confirmed after a minute or so after scanning with his binoculars that they indeed were killer whales as he saw a bull fin pop up. We worked our way out towards the area and stopped for another scan. I could see others traveling west that were slightly north of the original group that we saw with a pair of bulls spread out. The first whales that we confirmed were CA174 and her newest offspring. We then confirmed one of the bulls in the slightly northern group as CA166 and then watched T049A1 porpoise to catch up with CA174 and her offspring. We saw T049A3, CA173, U083 and U084. They came together to prey share what we suspected a seal from the behaviour, and smell after they finished it off (48 15.7/123 45.3).

At 1240, a lunge-feeding humpback was spotted near Crescent Bay (48 11.800/-123 43.650). “Morning Star” stayed with the humpback for about ten minutes as it continuously lunged through the water with its mouth wide open and identified it as BCY0769. At 1250, a report of killer whales near Victoria came in.

“Morning Star” headed back east and began looking for the leaders south of Beechey Head.

We made our way back into town and I headed out on Mike 1 to find them. I called Gord Rowles as I was leaving the fuel dock at 1255 and had him take a look from his 23rd floor apartment (Crow's Nest) to see if he could see them as I figured they would be within his view by that time. Within a couple of minutes he spotted east bound killer whales south east of Race Rocks slightly west of a group of humpbacks. I made my way out towards the humpbacks with a following sea as it was moderate north east wind. I found a group of 4 humpbacks tight together quite animated in the 2 - 3 foot chop but no sign of the killer whales. Gord hadn't seen them again as the sunlight had gone behind the clouds and the lighting had gone flat making spotting difficult. There were 3 other boats out of Victoria that had also left at 1300 and eventually one of the boats spotted some killer whale slightly south of Race Rocks. After a few minutes of the other boats arriving in the area we could see there were a fair number of them spread out foraging. The first whales identified to the south were the L54's, L84, and L88. The first whale I saw to the north east of the group was L83. I slowly made my way to the south towards the L54's and photographed as many as I could on my way. I finally arrived with L88, L108 and L117 who appeared to be the furthest south animals on a track towards Admiralty Inlet. The light was diminishing so I worked my way back towards the lead animals hoping to get some of the ones I had missed but only came across repeats which included L84 and 110 who seemed to be foraging. The animals to the north were tracking south towards the southern animals.

I had confirmed CA172, CA173, CA166, and T123A but there were several others reported in the area I didn't have time to confirm ID's.
Jeff Freidman on J2 had come across what he thought was the T038A's and T035A's south bound north of Baynes channel as he was making his way out to the Victor Golf group.

We slogged our way against the large south east seas and made our way into Oak Bay. They were last seen slightly south of Baynes channel so we figured we would find them near the Oak Bay golf course. After 15 minutes of scanning the waters in Oak Bay I decided they must have slipped past us so we made our way slowly towards the large group who were now south of Trial.

The three whales were northbound close to shore and “Morning Star” stayed for one surfacing to get proof of presence photos before continuing toward Admiralty Inlet.

At 8:45, breaching whales were spotted near Partridge Bank. The whales were soon identified at the T35As, T38As, and the T137s. They were attacking not just one but THREE Steller sea lions. The sea lions were huddled together, each facing out in different directions and ready to defend themselves. It appeared that one sea lion was injured while the other two were still perky. The whales tried to separate them multiple times but were unsuccessful. 

A pattern then started to emerge. The whales would back off and trail behind or circle the sea lions from a distance, likely patiently waiting for the injured sea lion to die. As the whales kept their distance, they would constantly spy hop to keep an eye on their prey. There were a few dozen spy hops during the encounter with T137B spy hopping the majority of the time, but spy hops by T35A, T38A, and T137 were common too. The sea lions would then take off in an attempt to escape and the whales would chase after them, block them, and then back off again.

“Morning Star” watched from a distance as the sea lions tried to escape again and again. By 12:45, the sea lions were suddenly no longer in sight and it appeared that the whales had abandoned them. The T35As, T38As, and T137s formed a resting line a few miles west/southwest of Partridge Bank and “Morning Star” ended the encounter as they slowly headed toward Admiralty Inlet.",21238 / DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2018encounters/94

Along with the T35As and T38As, a male known as U57 and several other unknown whales were reported to be with them. Dave headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat around 1415. On the way south, the whales were reported to have begun an attack on a Steller sea lion and this attack was still going on when Dave arrived on scene around 1515 about mid-way between Dungeness Spit and Smith Island.
The whales were actively ramming and tail lobbing on a large sea lion at the surface. U57 and another male were just on the periphery of the attack and were taking extremely long dives so they were not being seen much during the attack. Along with the six T35As and T38As, there were four new whales other than U57. Mark Malleson had photographed U57 in the Strait of Juan de Fuca the previous year but the other four had never been photographed this far in the inside waters of the Salish Sea before. After arriving home, Dave sent photos off to Jared Towers who confirmed U57’s identity along with providing IDs and sending a matriline diagram of the other four unknown whales. Besides U57, Jared says the other male is known as U56 and both are the probable sons of a two nicked female known as U36. A medium sized juvenile present was U36A. The second unknown female sized whale who was present was U137. U137 seems to belong to the U36 group but his/her relationship to the others is unknown. Jared says DFO only has a few records of this group from near the shelf edge off northern Vancouver Island and Haida Gwaii.
By about 1538, the whales had finally killed the Steller sea lion and all the whales moved in to feed on the carcass. For more than an hour and a half, the whales continued to feed and socialize without really moving anywhere. U56 seemed to have a habit of staying down a long time and then would surface twice before arching big and disappearing again. He would often do a lazy tail lob after his big arch. There were lots of pec slaps and tail lobs from the other whales too. On multiple occasions a younger whale would log at the surface and vocalize.

It was then an easy choice for Ken to give up on the Governor’s Task Force response he was working on and head to the boat with camera gear and suitcase to stay overnight in Port Angeles. Ken departed in “Chimo” from Snug Harbor at 11:45 and encountered the whales foraging and drifting west off the Elwha River plume in the Strait of Juan de Fuca at 12:40.

L87 (Spot 1) was the most northerly whale of the spread out group, very near the US/Canada border in mid-Strait. He methodically headed in a straight line west, not apparently foraging at the time but acting more like a flanking guard preventing fish from going around the whale line-up. Next in line, a few hundred yards south and east of L87 was J27 swimming in a zig-zag pattern toward the west and engaging in the occasional fish chase, with no obvious catches. The rest of J pod was very spread out south of them with many individuals engaging in fish chase with some success as the entire assemblage moved slowly west in an ebbing tide. Most inshore was J26 (Spot 12), traveling in a fairly straight line toward the west and often leaning to the left (shoreward) as he surfaced and dove repeatedly. He seemed very relaxed for the most part, but occasionally changed course slightly and appeared to be cluing in on fish without rapid chasing. This would have been a great situation to observe what was really going on with a drone. The situations that we have seen with a drone operating from land off San Juan Island have provided great insight into interpreting what we see in horizontal observations. Routine vessel-based drone observations of underwater behavior will commence for us next year, concurrent with the vessel-based horizontal identification work we have done for 43 years for a comprehensive cataloging of SRKW.

It was very encouraging to see the whales foraging off of the Elwha River now that the dams have been removed and the natural salmon populations to that watershed are recovering. The expected return of Chinook this year to the Elwha is 5200. The whales cannot survive without salmon, and we whole-heartedly have pressed for wild natural salmon restoration in all of the rivers of the Pacific Northwest for their benefit, and for fishermen. That is why Ken is sticking his neck out and campaigning for the big one – the Snake River wild natural salmon recovery following LSRD removal in the immediate future. That recovery alone could contribute to hundreds of thousands to a million adult Chinook salmon returning to the entrance of the Columbia River each year! (see graph above in slide show) The SRKW demographics and rapid trend toward extinction show that we cannot wait for a political decision – the biological decision for this issue is due now before the whales have no reproductive capacity left. There are only a few females reproducing in the recent decade, and no successful births in the past three years. Even if there is the successful birth of a few calves this winter, and they survive (which is doubtful without sufficient food), it will be at least another decade before they can possibly contribute to the reproductive cohort.",21238 / DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2018encounters/84

The whales were traveling north, surfacing synchronously and close together, regularly taking dives of five minutes or more. The whales briefly changed behavior about 30 minutes into the encounter, splitting up and circling, before coming back together and continuing north. The team left the pair at 1625 as they continued to head north to document a group of residents that was traveling through Haro Strait at the same time (see encounter 50). At 1720, they briefly rejoined the pair as they continued north past Kelp Reef, before ending the encounter at 1734.",21238 / DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2018encounters/49

The whales occasionally circled, but generally moved slowly to the south. T73B stayed primarily on the outside of the group and surfaced less regularly, while T37B1 surfaced much more regularly than the rest of the group.

Instead, they made a big swoop to the south in the evening of 13 July and disappeared in the night, only to be seen again in the morning coming back in. Maybe they have found some fish to pursue – must check the Albion Test Fishery in the next few days. The whales were spread out in matrilineal groups as they passed south of Discovery Island and fanned out across Haro Strait toward the west side of San Juan Island. It was difficult to determine if all of the J and K matrilines were present because the whales were spread over many miles. Since the whales were coming back into interior waters instead of leaving, the opportunity was taken to focus on a few whales to observe if any foraging occurred. None was apparent, but the occasional tail slap indicated they might be following some fish that were moving toward San Juan Island.

Most the whales headed south past CWR where we photographed them from the deck and managed to get photos of the three whales not seen the day before: K43, J17, and J53 plus several others. After it looked like most of the whales had passed, Dave headed down to the boat and left Snug Harbor at 1240. There was another group reported well behind the lead whales near Battleship Rock heading south so Dave went there first and got on scene around 1255 off the north end of Kellett Bluff. The K13s were spread out in loose pairs from near the bluff to about three quarters of a mile offshore. K25 and K38 blew by while others escaped un-photographed. Since this was not a very workable situation, the decision was made to head south to find the other whales who had hopefully stalled out down island somewhere. After leaving the scene and committing to heading south, word came over the radio that the K13s slowed down and began foraging around southern Kellett Bluff and Open Bay.
Around 1335, the first down island whales were encountered off the south end of False Bay. These whales were the J16s, minus J26, plus J31 and J46. The whales were in a loose group and were slowly heading offshore. There was some rolling and splashing in this group and J42 logged at the surface and vocalized in the air enthusiastically. An adult male was foraging to the north off False Bay and taking extremely long dives.

South of the group, K33 was actively chasing a salmon. K22 was also foraging in the area but almost a quarter mile to the north. K33 milled around in the same area before he found another fish to chase. K12 and K43 were found a little offshore and they were mostly traveling southwest with K43 doing occasional lazy tail lobs. J27 showed up out of nowhere, passed up K12 and K43, and headed off to the southwest too. Perhaps he was the male foraging off False Bay earlier. K37 was another half mile offshore of K12 and K43 and he also was heading southwest. He briefly intersected with a small, loose foraging group of J31, J36, and J46, before turning back and eventually rejoined K12 and K43.
By 1515, the K13s were offshore of False Bay, still spread out in loose pairs. As they filed by, K34 breached twice in a row which was followed by another breach by K25.

Dave called Michael, and they grabbed their gear and left the dock a bit before 8 o’clock. After a bit of searching across Haro Strait, they encountered the J16s, J14s, J19s, and J22s headed east from Sunset point at 8:30. The whales were spread into two tight, travelling groups, pointed for the west side of San Juan Island. After getting some ID shots on this group of Js, they decided to leave this group to look for the rest of J pod and any K pod whales that might be travelling with them. They searched further west, and then circled back towards the south of San Juan island. They found K37 travelling fast towards the west side of the island, followed by K34 doing the same. Once off the west side, they encountered the rest of the K13s. The whales were spread in groups of twos and threes, foraging along the shore. Dave and Michael decided to slowly work their way down island to look for the rest of K pod, and encountered the rest of the K12s, K14s, as well as members of the J17s and J39. After a long search, they got the report that the remaining members of K pod, K21 and the K16s, were south of Hein Bank. They went to observe these three whales for several minutes before heading back towards the island. There, they encountered a large, social group of K pod whales and J45 near Cattle Pass. Soon, another tight group of whales composed of the J11s, J19s, and J14s, headed towards this group. The groups met up and began socializing, with lots of percussive behaviors, spyhopping, and rolling. The group drifted into Cattle Pass and up San Juan channel. As they left the scene, Dave and Michael spotted the J39, the J22s, the K13s, and L87 headed into Cattle Pass behind the main group. Heading up the island, they found members of the K12s, J17s, and J16s fighting the flood tide as they headed south past Hannah Heights.

At 1457 we came across a westbound bull killer whale between Port Renfrew and Sombrio Beach which turned out to be J26. J50 was paralleling him on his inshore side within a 100 meters. They were traveling quickly at a steady 6 - 7 knots. We noticed immediately how skinny J50 was looking and the depression behind her blowhole was very noticeable. There was no sign of any other animals anywhere so we pushed further west to see if we had gone by them prior to spotting J26. We came across J16 and J36 a mile ahead of them. J16 started to actively forage off the entrance to Port of San Juan and then J50 joined her. J36 was also foraging slightly offshore of them and J26 was even further off.

The encounter began as the whales cruised in a tight slow-travel resting group right off the entrance to Friday Harbor, as if to beckon tourists. Two whale-watching boats were remaining a respectful distance away from the whales, and two ferry boats were loading/unloading innumerable passengers at the dock while a seaplane with additional passengers took off over the placid scene. This is pretty much what it is like on a summer day in much of this inland Salish Sea surrounded by several million humans going about their daily routine - not bad for those who love nature and too busy for those who wish for solitude. The whales, of course, were aware of the humans around them but they had long since lost any trepidation over their presence; and they were going about their daily routine – swimming about seventy-five miles a day and looking for food between bouts of social activity and leisure.
Food for these “Transient” whales is the red meat of seals, sea lions, and other marine mammals that abound in Salish Sea waters. Currently, there are many thousands of seals in the area, having recovered from “culls” of many more thousands a few decades ago before marine mammal protection became law on both sides of the US/Canada border. The “Transient” killer whales have plenty to eat, and their population has increased dramatically in the forty plus years that we have studied them. Plus, they come into the study area virtually daily now, whereas there were relatively few Transient encounters when we began our pioneering photo-identification research.
The opposite is true for the “Resident” killer whales of yesteryear – the SRKWs. Their food supply, which we now know is largely Chinook salmon, is becoming scarce in the Salish Sea. At least, it is becoming scarce during critical seasons that are important to the whales – for example, during pregnancies. And, the Chinook salmon that are now in the area are mostly of hatchery origin – smaller in size and not sustainable without continuing expensive hatchery ‘factory’ production. What is needed for them is massive recovery of natural populations of Chinook salmon throughout their range.
The group of Bigg’s Transient whales that we encountered were the T124As that we have seen in this area frequently since January. Maybe we should now call them “Resident”? We left them in Upright Channel as another ferry was travelling to Friday Harbor with another load of tourists that come to this lovely place we call the San Juans.

There were consistent radio reports of them as they traveled south a few miles to the east of where the transients were. When we were finished with the transients, we decided to check out the residents who were several miles due south of Pt. Roberts. The water between the residents and transients was pretty sloppy and it took us a while to slog over to where the residents were.
We got on scene with Js and Ls at 1640 a little over halfway between Pt. Roberts and Patos Island. The whales were very spread out and foraging on their way south towards Boundary Pass. We first saw J35 and J47 to the west of most of the others and the pair was loosely spread and seemed to foraging. They were making slow circles in the same area-perhaps trying pin down the location of a salmon in the cloudy water. A little to the east of the J35s, we found L90 and J45 spread out and traveling south. To the east of these two was a slightly larger loose group of whales including the L103s, J26, and L105. L90 and J45 joined the larger group a few minutes later. At 1711 L90, with an assist from L103 and L123, began a vigorous chase of a salmon. L90 even leapt entirely out of the water in her pursuit and, after several more twists and turns, eventually caught what looked like a chinook salmon after a two minute chase. After the chase was over, a whale that was probably L90 breached three times as she and the L103s continued south. While the chase was going on, J26 and L105 paired up and were being social as they traveled south.
Another quarter mile or more to the east, we found L87 and J49 traveling south spread out from one another. Another whale who turned out to be J37 was several hundred yards ahead of those two. We saw another cow/small juvenile pair south of J37 but they disappeared before we could get to them. J27 was another quarter mile to the east of L87 and we settled for taking a distant proof of presence on him.

There was a large group of transients, including T175-a rare visitor to the Salish Sea, found north of East Point heading north. Around noon, we got the OK to go out on the Ts up north so Dave and Michael grabbed their gear and headed for the boat. After a quick stop at Roche Harbor to top off with fuel, we got underway and started heading north a little after 1300.
We got on scene at about 1350 a few miles southwest of the Coal Docks that are just south of the Tsawwassen ferry docks. The whales were in a single, slightly strung out by matrilines group and they were heading west when we got there. Along with the male T175, the groups present were the T36As, T65As, T99s, plus a few others we figured were part of the T173 matriline. After our first left side pass with the large group, there was a breakaway group of four, including the sprouter T65A2, that headed off southwest toward the Belle Chains while the main group continued west toward Active Pass. For the next fifteen minutes or so, we stayed with the main group and got right side shots. The T36As, the T65As minus T65A2, and the T99s were in the main group with T175 following closely at the rear. T175 was staying down longer than all the other whales and, on more than one occasion, only took two breaths before going down on another long dive.
We then left the main group to head over to the group of four off to the southwest. Along with T65A2, this turned out to be T176, plus a large juvenile/subadult that is probably T176A, and a small juvenile of T176’s. This recent visit ( 6/27-6/29 ) by the T176s is the first time, to our knowledge, that this matriline has been documented in the inside waters around southern Vancouver Island. The T176s are, apparently, not seen often anywhere and not much is known about them. T175 had made only one previous appearance in the area back in 2012. After getting good lefts on the T176s, we headed back to the main group who had angled southwest and were now closer to the other four.
The large group milled around, with some groups drifting off a short ways, for almost 45 minutes. Around 1520, T65A2 and the T176s rejoined the larger group and all the whales milled around for another twenty minutes before heading back northeast. The whales still seemed to be in a social mood as they headed mostly northeast back toward Tsawwassen and there were several taillobs and other splashings going on. T36A1 breached four times and we were able to confirm that she is a female. We ended the encounter a couple minutes before 1600 with the whales still being social as they moved slowly northeast a couple miles west of where the encounter began.",21238 / DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2018encounters/41

We left Snug Harbor a little after 1300 and headed south, pointed for mid-Haro Strait. The leaders were reported to have already passed Seabird Point on Discovery Island and were heading for the SJI shoreline.
J26 had been reported to be trailing the leaders but was well ahead of the trailing groups and we found him mid-Haro Strait at 1330. J26 was traveling fast due north toward Land Bank. After a quick look at him, we moved ahead in the direction he was heading to see if we could find the rest of the J16s. We found the J19s and J50 spread out near Edwards Point heading south. J26 appeared several hundred yards down island of the others and was now also heading slowly south.
We then headed back down the west side to find more whales. About fifteen minutes later, we found a few spread out whales offshore of False Bay traveling fast east toward Eagle Point. Two of these whales were J27 and J40 and we also caught a glimpse of the J22s. L72 and L105 were offshore of those whales and they were traveling slowly southeast, possibly foraging.
Around 1530, we moved inshore toward Eagle Point to see who our drone crew were flying over. Ten minutes later, we found J31 right at Eagle Point pointed south into the flood and not going anywhere. She did three lazy half-breaches in a row before continuing her search for fish coming to her. Tom and Michael got some really good and interesting stuff on her while flying the drone from land at Eagle Point.
We then headed back offshore to find more whales but everyone were still very spread out and hard to find. We briefly saw L83 heading southwest and then found L103 and L123 traveling together also heading southwest toward Hein Bank. After we left the L103s, we had a brief pass-by by J38 and then L87 showed up out of nowhere a few minutes later. As he passed us, L87 leaned on his side and intentionally caught a large clump of bull kelp on his dorsal fin. He carried the kelp for several surfacings before letting it slide off.
Near 1700, we saw our biggest group of the day of 4 whales traveling southwest and heading our way. This was J27, J39, L105, and L110 in a social group. They kept moving southwest toward Hein Bank while they horsed around with one another. Kelp was involved again and J27 was photographed with a strand in his mouth while L105 had more draped over his back. L83 joined this group a little later. We ended the encounter at 1725 southeast of Middle Bank due to deteriorating sea conditions with the whales still pointed southwest.",21238 / DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2018encounters/40

Members of the J16s were now heading slowly south in Andrews Bay with J26 traveling about a quarter mile behind and offshore of J16, J42, and J50. These four whales appeared to be the trailers now that the whales were heading south and we figured J36 must be down island traveling with other whales.
We left the J16s a little before 0830 off Bellevue Point and headed south to False Bay to see if we could find more whales. After waiting for about ten minutes and scanning and not seeing much of anything to the south, we finally heard a blow and saw a couple of whales approach from the north. This was J37 and J49 and they were spread from each other and foraging. J36 also showed up in the same area and continued heading south. The J19s appeared from the north and were also spread out with J41 in the lead. J51 was goofing around nearer to J19 and he breached on two occasions. The rest of J pod and L87 must have been south of Eagle Point already.

Although the sea conditions were glass calm and the visibility was more than five miles with binoculars, no whales could be found. Mark Malleson had been notified at 0605 and he went to a lookout near Trial Island, but he also could not find any whales. Where did they go? The tide was ebbing swiftly, and a few hours later the whales were spotted passing Race rocks headed out to the Pacific Ocean. “Chimo” returned to Snug Harbor and “Morningstar” departed to briefly get proof of presence photos as the whales passed Otter Point west of Sooke before noon.
In the later morning whales were reported near Patos Island heading toward President Channel. As the morning progressed it became apparent that these whales were travelling in two groups, with one of the groups (Js) splitting off near Speiden Island and eventually meandering back north to Boundary Pass, while the other (Ls) continued through Speiden Channel and into Haro Strait. “Chimo” departed Snug Harbor at 1140 to meet the L group in hopes that they would come south in Haro Strait; but, they did not. Instead, the Ls gathered into a close resting group and headed west toward Gooch Island, Canada. The NMFS research crew followed them several hundred yards in trail searching for fecal samples, while “Chimo” paralleled the whales and ken took proof of presence photos. Again, L92 was not present, and regrettably we consider him deceased (see press release). The whales meandered west and north and eventually northeast toward Tilly Point, Pender Island, and then reportedly over toward the J whales in Boundary Pass near Monarch Head. “Chimo” had departed by then as there was no point in trying to get catalogue photos of resting whales that did not arch to show their saddle patch.

The forecast was for calm seas in the Strait as far as the west coast of Vancouver Island and beyond for most of the day, and the skies were clear. By the time they were abeam of Port Renfrew at the west entrance of the Strait, J pod calls were heard on the Lime Kiln hydrophone and a few spread out whales were sighted in Haro Strait by shore observers on San Juan Island. Jeanne Hyde observed some J whales from the San Juan County Park and some L whales from Land Bank, as they did the west-side shuffle for a couple of hours before more or less heading north before noon when the tide changed from ebb to flood. Since “Morningstar” was already nearing the rugged west coast of Vancouver Island, they continued the search for any additional SRKWs that might be trailing as far back as Carmanah lighthouse before they turned back. A few J whales, led by J19, passed CWR heading northwest in Haro Strait at 1055, and then they too turned back toward Bellevue Point. Finally, around 1220 it seemed as though the spread out assemblage of whales committed to heading up Haro Strait. The L12s were the last group of whales to pass CWR heading up Haro Strait at 1325, but they turned around and headed down Haro Strait by 1530.
Meanwhile, as the first group of whales passed CWR, Ken departed from Snug Harbor and encountered some of the leaders off Open Bay. It was obvious from the spread out distribution of whales and the choppy seas that this was going to be a “proof of presence” encounter, not an ideal photo day. “Morningstar” returned by 1400 to encounter the whales near Turn Point and took proof of presence photos from several hundred yards distance from there to Active Pass, Canada. All in all, we documented all of J pod present, plus L87; and, we documented 22 of the other L pod whales with the notable exception that L92 was missing. His aunt, L90, was present, and therefore we had deemed that L92 had passed because he and his aunt have been inseparable for years since his mother died in 2002. It is a testament to the strong family ties that these last two living members of a 7 whale matriline have travelled together for so long.

Ten minutes after departure, J pod was reported to be spread out and taking long dives off Monarch Head in Boundary Pass, so the plan was modified to include an encounter with them before returning to Snug Harbor. Just off Turn Point, Stuart Island, at 1455, the first whales were seen heading south close to shore as a couple of whale watching boats were miles away in Boundary Pass. As luck would have it, the batteries were dead in the camera that had been left with the boat in Port Angeles, so the first documentation with the lead whales was with iPhone video.

“Chimo” returned to the lead whales (the J16s, with J31 and J40) in Haro Strait just west of Speiden Channel at 1604 and stayed with them until 1732 off Kellett Bluff when L87 joined them and all of the whales headed offshore in the direction of Kelp Reef. More spread out whales were behind and offshore of them, and it looked like there would not be much chance of a successful drone flight so “Chimo” went ahead to CWR and loitered near the reef in case any whales came close enough to identify. At least the presence of the boat allowed the drone team (Tom Cogan, Chris Teren, and Andy ) to practice launch and locating and tracking an object at the surface of the water. After this practice, “Chimo” returned to Snug Harbor and Ken went back to CWR to confer with the drone team. Just before sunset, a few whales did come past CWR about one and one-half miles out and the drone launched again just to practice prep and launch timing (about 5 minutes).
The whale encounter did indicate an interesting foraging strategy on the part of the whales: they were very spread out and swimming into the flooding tide, frequently changing course in the tide rips. Occasionally, the activity of several whales together suggested they had found a fish. The slicks left behind by this activity were checked out and smallish scales were occasionally seen deep in the water. They were too deep to reach with the prey sample net, but one glob of what may have been fecal material did stick to the net. Unfortunately, it was too small and mucous-like to collect – it disintegrated when attempts were made to clean it off the net. We need the professional poop collectors out here to work in the trail of the whales while Orca Survey identifies who is leaving the sample, and Icarus (the Drone and team) is documenting who is swimming and sharing with whom. Oh well, at least we know that J pod is going back to the Pacific Ocean after a two-week foraging stint in the Strait of Georgia. We could calculate how many calories (and fish) it required to keep them alive for that length of time. None evidenced “peanut-head”, but they also were not “fat”. Winters have always been lean times in their foraging. Let us hope the Spring and Summer are better.

Melisa, Jane, and Tom met at Snug Harbor and left aboard “Morning Star” at 1400. At 1440, “Morning Star” arrived on scene with the T124A2s and T124C just south of Musgrave Rock in Satellite Channel. The whales had been heading north into Sansum Narrows but had turned around and were now porpoising together toward Cape Keppel at 8-9 knots. It appeared that they had heard other whales nearby and were excitedly rushing in the direction they thought they were in.

When the T124A2s and T124C were about halfway to Cape Keppel, they slowed down and milled about for a few minutes. Two loud vocalizations were heard through the bottom of the boat. The whales then turned toward Cherry Point. T124A2A traveled with T124C for a few surfacings before splitting off to join T124A2 and T124A2B.

By 1715, the T124A2s had turned and headed back toward Separation Point/Sansum Narrows with purpose. T124C lagged behind for a moment, tail slapping multiple times before following after them. T124C kept tail slapping and breached twice as he trailed behind the T124A2s. T124A2s. T124A2 was also tail slapping and breached twice as well. It seemed as though they had heard other whales again.

At 1745, the T124A2s and T124C located the T86As and T124Ds on the west side of Sansum Narrows, close to the shoreline, north of Separation Point. The T124A2s and T124C moved from the eastern side of Sansum Narrows over to the west to join them. The T86As, T124A2s, T124C, and the T124Ds then continued north in a big group together. “Morning Star” left the whales north of Sansum Point, heading north in Sansum Narrows toward Octopus Point at 1820.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2018encounters/17

Dave headed over to CWR and got Barbara and they headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat a little afternoon with the hopes of getting as many groups as possible. By the time we made it to American Camp, the lead group was reported to be already nearing Smith Island and pointed for Puget Sound. We were not going to get those whales but Jeanne Hyde took photos of them from shore at Cattle Point and said she got members of the T100s and T101s. There was another group heading south off Griffin Bay that were reported over the radio to be the T46s and T137s plus some extras. The T2Cs were north of them and another group was spotted heading west in Thatcher Pass.
We got on scene with the T46s/T137s group at about 1300 as they were passing the sea lions on Whale Rock in Cattle Pass. The whales were in a fairly tight group heading south-southwest in Middle Channel. The extra whales turned out to be all six of the T46Bs and they were in front of the group with T122 while the rest of the T46s and T137s were a few whale lengths behind. We left this group at 1325 and headed north through Cattle Pass toward the T2Cs who were now off Griffin Bay. The T2Cs were off Shark Reef when we got there at 1340. T2C, T2C1, T2C3, and T2C4 were on a long dive together on the Lopez Island side of the Channel. T2C2 was by himself about a half mile to the northwest. The other four T2Cs eventually came up and were still milling off Shark Reef when T2C2 began heading over to them and he joined the group a few minutes later. The T2Cs milled briefly as a group before heading slowly north. By this time, “Blackfish 3” had found the Thatcher Pass whales right before they entered Harney Channel. These whales were identified as the T60s and they headed west in Harney Channel and entered West Sound. We left the T2Cs heading slowly north up San Juan Channel at 1407 and went for the T60s in West Sound.
“Blackfish 3” helpfully waited for us and we arrived on scene at about 1445 when the T60s were still deep in West Sound. The whales were about a half mile north of Victim Island heading slowly back south toward the entrance on the west side of the sound. T60 and T60C were tight together while the other three were in a group about a hundred yards to the east. T60 and T60C passed along the east shoreline of Victim Island and then the east Double Island shoreline. Here the other three joined them and they all continued slowly south in a loose group. We ended the encounter at 1515 just on the inside of Broken Point on the north side of Shaw Island as the whales pointed east back toward the Shaw Island ferry landing.",15569-01/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2018encounters/16

By late afternoon, reports had multiple transient matrilines heading north in Haro Strait at Middle Bank. Dave and Barbara Todd headed down to the boat and left Snug Harbor around 1645 in a light rain. Expecting to have to go all the way down to Middle Bank in the rain, we were surprised to find whales mid-Haro Strait off the north end of Land Bank at about 1700. The whales were the T2Cs, T46s, and T137s and they had all been reported previously to be among the whales at Middle Bank. The whale watch boat “J1”, who had been waiting for us to make sure we got on whales, still had other Ts down south of us in the gloom.
We stuck with the northern groups who had been altogether when we first got on scene before the T2Cs split off and were traveling north fast about a quarter mile ahead of the T46s and T137s. T2C2 was not present with the T2Cs and it was not known how far behind the others he was. The T46s and T137s were also traveling north quickly in a tight group. The group loosened up some a few times throughout the encounter although the whales always tightened back up again. By about 1745, the T46s and T137s group were back within a couple of hundred yards to the southwest of the T2Cs when something kinda confusing happened. Through rain covered glasses, small splashes that might have been Dall’s porpoise were seen almost a half mile ahead in the direction of D’arcy Island. The T46s and T137s were on a long dive and we started to putt in the direction of the splashes when the T2Cs came up once beside us and then completely vanished for the rest of the encounter. A couple minutes later, whales came up where we had seen the splashes and this was the T46s and T137s who must have moved very quickly underwater to get where they were when they came up. They then did a wide circle of the area as a group before going on a long dive. It was unclear if this was unsuccessful hunt or an extremely inconspicuous kill. When they came up, they were heading north again in two tight groups that merged soon after. We left the whales still cruising north about a mile southwest of the south end of Kellett Bluff at 1825.",15569-01/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2018encounters/15
2018,2018-03-11,2,14,13:10:00,18:25:00,18900s (~5.25 hours),Morning Star,"Melisa Pinnow, Jane Cogan, Tom Cogan",J Pod,NA,Georgia Strait,49.0688819885254,-123.58415222168,48.8869819641113,-123.303268432617,"Around 1140, a large group of southbound killer whales was seen offshore of Thrasher Rock in Georgia Strait. “Morning Star” was already out on the water after just finishing up Encounter 13 and headed for Georgia Strait via Trincomali Channel and Porlier Pass.

At 1310, J19 and J39 were found 4 miles north of Porlier Pass, east of Valdez Island in Georgia Strait. The two were spread out and slowly traveling southbound. A few whales were visible far to the east, so “Morning Star” slowly worked its way in that direction.

Twenty minutes later, J41 and J51 were located. The pair was foraging together and after a bit of milling, a salmon was rammed out of the water by J41. After a few minutes, “Morning Star” left them to look for more whales to the east. It was obvious now that J pod was spread over a very large area in the strait and that finding everyone was going to take some time.

Nearly twenty minutes later, L87 was located slowly traveling south by himself. After a few proof of presence photos, “Morning Star” continued east. About twenty minutes later at 1410, J35 and J47 were found traveling slowly south together. Ten minutes later, J27, J31, and J46 were found spread out and slowly traveling south. Shortly after, J40 and J45 were seen traveling south together. Then, J26, J22, J36, J37, J38, and J49 were found in a spread out and slowly heading south together.

By 1450, J16, J42, and J50 were found slowly traveling south together. These three were further east than any of the other whales. J42 was goofing off with multiple pec slaps and an aerial scan. With all of J pod moving at such a slow pace, all the whales were still northeast of Porlier Pass.

“Morning Star” headed back west and acquired better photos of J22 and J38, then J26 and J36. By 1532, a small but very playful social group was starting to form. It started with J37, J40, and J49. J45 paralleled the other three for a little bit before he joined too. Then J36 split off from J26 and spy hopped/breached her way over to the group. Then J46 suddenly appeared in the group. Dozens of tails slaps, cartwheels, breaches, spy hops, and aerial scans ensued. The group also gathered tightly together to log at the surface a few times. They would then get excited and roll all over each other. L87 eventually joined the group as well.

“Morning Star” followed along with the social group and by 1710, they were five miles northwest of Active Pass. The social group then moved closer to the Galiano Island shoreline and other whales, but J22, J26, J38, and others were still spread to the east. Spread out, backlit and hugging the Galiano shoreline was J17, J27, J31, J35, J41, J47, and J51. J47 and J51 were goofing off together.

The lead whales were seen further to the south at 1730. “Morning Star” reached them half an hour later as they neared the entrance of Active Pass. J19 was still in the lead, followed by J39, then J16 and J36. All four appeared committed to continuing south or southeast in Georgia Strait, and not taking Active Pass. “Morning Star” left them outside of Active Pass around 1835.

At 1105, “Morning Star” arrived on scene with the T2Cs as they headed north in San Juan Channel, just south of Reuben Tarte State Park.

A few minutes later, the T2Cs located a seal right off of the Reuben Tarte State Park shoreline. The whales made short work of their prey and celebrated their kill with tail slaps, a spy hop, and an aerial scan. Gulls flew in to pick up the scraps. “Morning Star” left the T2Cs milling in the same spot at 1134.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2018encounters/13

He headed over to CWR where he and Ken watched the whales, who looked like the T2Cs, through the scopes as they rounded Bellevue Point. Dave then left for Snug Harbor and left in the boat a little after 1700. The boat got on scene about ten minutes later to find the T2Cs milling off Low Island. The whales took about a ten minute long dive before coming up right at Sunset Point. T2C2 was a few hundred yards offshore where he began to fall behind. The other four whales eventually came up again between CWR and Smugglers Cove and began to mill around. T2C2 was several hundred yards behind at this point but still traveling slowly north. T2C and T2C1 both turned and pointed south before stopping and logging at the surface together while they waited. The younger whales milled around them. T2C2 finally caught up, and the group continued slowly north. At about 1800 as the light was failing, the T2Cs began a prolonged attack on a harbor seal at the south end of Mitchell Bay. The seal was still alive at 1827 and Dave had to call it quits due to darkness at 1830 right out in front of Snug Harbor.",15569-01/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2018encounters/12

The lead group was made up of the J16s and J17s. The trailing group was made up of the J14s, J22s, J27, J31, and J46. K21 was further out in the channel and paralleling the two groups by a few hundred yards. More blows were seen further north, so “Morning Star” left the two groups of Js and K21 to locate the leaders. The leaders were found near Enterprise Reef, and they were the J19s, J39, and the K13s.   
As the K12s, K14s, and K16s arrived from the south, they joined the leaders and waited off the western entrance to Active Pass. When the rest of J pod arrived, all the whales entered Active Pass together. Tail slaps, pec slaps, spy hops, and breaches ensued. A majority of J pod moved into the lead position, with K pod trailing. The whales hugged the northern side of the pass as they headed east. 
As J and K pod exited Active Pass, the whales quickly dispersed over a very large area. It appeared that J pod took a more easterly course while some Ks headed north. “Morning Star” located K14, K16, K21, K26, and K35 very spread out, elusive, and on very long dives.

Melisa, Dave, Jane, and Tom met at Snug Harbor and left aboard “Morning Star"" at about 1410. “Island Explorer 5” had since left the whales for bit but then returned to the scene and stayed with them until “Morning Star” could reach the area. “Morning Star” arrived on scene with T87, the T124A2s, and T124C at 1510. The whales were still in Rosario Strait off the south side of Allan Island, near Williamson Rocks.

As the whales started heading southwest, T124A2A and T124C began goofing off together and lagged behind T87, T124A, and T124A2B. At times, T124A2B would fall back and play with T124A2A and T124C before joining back up with mom. Once the group arrived at a shallow area to the west of Lawson Reef, they all started milling and socializing together.

There were many spy hops, aerial scans, leaps, rolls, tail slaps, and headstands from T124A2A and T124A2B. One particular headstand revealed that T124A2B is a female. T124C was active with a spy hop and multiple tails slaps. T124A2 also did a mini spy hop and an aerial scan. The only one who wasn’t goofing off was elder male T87. He milled about at the edge of the group. “Morning Star” left T87, the T124A2s, and T124C still milling and goofing off in the shallow area to the west of Lawson reef at 1648.

As “Morning Star” was on its way back to the harbor, “J1” offered to stay with another group of transients until “Morning Star” could reach them. At 1720, “Morning Star” had a quick look at the T124As and T124A1 near Upright Head, on the east side of Shaw Island.

The whales were heading northwest at first but soon turned southwest after a long deep dive; and then pointed southeast shortly after another, even longer, deep dive. The whales continued to zig-zag and take long deep dives until they found a seal at 1530. The whole family then milled about in the same area and T60C would disappear for a while, then the rest of his family members would disappear while he was at the surface. It is possible that they were taking turns pinning the seal at the bottom.

About twenty minutes later, it appeared that the T60s had killed the seal. T60D separated from the others during this time and milled about on his own. The family then gathered together and started traveling southwest but stalled out again a few minutes later. It is possible that they were still feeding on the seal from earlier, but they could have also located and killed another one.

About ten minutes later, the whales were back on the move, with T60D and T60E goofing off and lagging behind the rest of the family. “Morning Star” left the T60s aiming for Race Rocks off the entrance to Pedder Bay at 1630.",15569-01/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2018encounters/8

Mark stayed with them for awhile before continuing on with his trip. Since it was a nice day, Tom and Jane Cogan were already out in their boat “Morning Star” on a whale search with Melisa Pinnow aboard and they went to the area after Mark left them.
“Morning Star” located the T10s 2 miles southeast of Trial Island around 1155 after Mark left them. They were heading southeast at about 9 knots but then started milling. T10 then split off from T10C and headed northeast and disappeared for about 40 minutes. During those 40 minutes, T10C was with a harbor seal but was treating it like it was a sea lion. Lots of lunges (not clearing the water), side sweeps, and ramming. T10C would also repeatedly go on super long deep dives while attacking the seal and the seal would just hang out at the surface when T10C was down. T10C would then come back up from the super long deep dives right where the seal was and pick up right where he left off. He would also slowly circle the seal at the surface. T10 eventually came back and when she did, they worked together with the ramming and the circling and finally killed the seal about 20 minutes later. The seal survived about an hour of beatings! “Morning Star” left T10 and T10C around 1342 as they started heading back towards Seabird Point, about 1 mile south of Seabird. By this point, other whale watch boats out of Victoria were on scene and “Morning Star” left to go on a search to the west in the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
Jane had been keeping Dave informed of the T10’s movements throughout the day. The T10s headed north on the Canadian side of Haro Strait and Dave finally committed to going out after a call from Jane at about five minutes to 1500.

Dave left Snug Harbor 1540 and got on scene at 1555 about a half mile west of Kelp Reef. Mark and another POW boat were just starting to head home from their afternoon trips leaving Dave all alone with the T10s. T10 and T10C were traveling slowly north in a tight pair, being mellow and cooperative.
At 1610, after a long dive, the pair came up vigorously milling in a small area. T10 and T10C were alternating their long dives with one animal at a time surfacing enthusiastically in multiple directions before arching big and going on a long dive. Then the other whale would start surfacing. This was classic whales having a seal pinned on the bottom behavior and they kept it up for fifteen minutes until a good-sized harbor seal popped to the surface. The whales immediately began their attack with T10C doing most of the lunges. It wasn’t quite clear if they killed the seal until they moved off to the north a little. Then, there was a little shaking from the whales and then a bunch of gulls swooped down to pick up seal scraps. Seal blubber oil could be smelled in the air. After the kill and a little milling, the T10s continued on after a spyhop from T10 and a couple of tail lobs from T10C. “Morning Star” had come back from their whale search for another brief look at the T10s and caught the tail end of the seal kill. Both boats left at about the same time with the T10s still heading slowly north along the southeast shoreline of D’Arcy Island at 1650.",15569-01/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2018encounters/6

Dave and Melisa hurried to Snug Harbor and left aboard “Orcinus"" at 1250. With help from Jeanne Hyde, “Orcinus” located the first group of whales a mile northwest of Yellow Island at 1316.

The first group was made up of J16, J41, J42, J50, and J51 and they were slowly traveling northwest. Trailing few hundred yards behind them was another group that contained J22, J36, J37, J38, J40, J45, and J49. J26 appeared further inshore toward the San Juan Island shoreline and paralleled the two groups while J19 and J39 surfaced a few hundred yards ahead of everyone. J27 and J31 also trailed behind the groups.

By 1340, J19, J26, J27, J31, J36, and J39 had all trickled over and joined up with the first group. However, J22, J38, J40, J45, and J49 continued to trail behind the larger group for a little longer. At 1418, they finally joined up with the others and all the whales formed a resting line ¾ of a mile southeast of Green Point, Spieden Island. The only whales missing from the resting line were the J17s and L87.

Surprisingly, the J17s and L87 suddenly materialized a few minutes later. They were hugging the San Juan Island shoreline and did not join the resting line. Instead, they slowly passed the resting line, moved past Lonesome Cove, and swam between Barren Island and its kelp beds.

At 1549, the J17s and L87 reached Battleship Island and swam between it and Henry Island. Once in Haro Strait, the J17s and L87 turned south. “Orcinus” stayed with the J17s and L87 for a few more minutes before turning around and waiting for the resting line to swim between Battleship and Henry Island. By the time the big group was in Haro Strait, the resting line had switched into a loose group in travel mode. “Orcinus” left the big group heading southwest at Kellet Bluff in rough seas at 1647.",15569-01/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2018encounters/5

Dave sped to Snug Harbor and left at about 1615. The sun was about to hit clouds hanging low over Vancouver Island and the seas were not calm so there would not be much time. Luckily, the whales were already off south Kellett Bluff and about mid-strait when “Orcinus” arrived on scene at about 1630. “Peregrine” reported finding another group on their way south that they believed to be the T18s after their original group headed off in the direction of Halibut Island. Dave was just arriving on scene and saw a straight-finned male spread out from another couple of other whales heading north when a large group of females, juveniles, and a sprouter appeared in a tight ball much closer. This was “Peregrine’s” original group and it included the T100s, including the T100Bs, and the T124As minus the T124A2s. The whales appeared to be socializing and were surfacing boisterously in a tight group pointed south. There was at least one spyhop. It was quickly getting dark and there were lots of large, scary looking logs bouncing around in choppy water so there was only time to stay for a couple of surfacings. Since these are not the type of conditions to push one’s luck with daylight, Dave left at about 1640 after it was obvious the whales weren’t coming up anytime soon or anywhere close after their first long dive.

Dave got ready and headed down to the boat and left Snug Harbor a little after 0900. Tom Cogan had already left aboard his boat “Morning Star” to go look for the whales and headed north on the American side. Dave was offshore of Kellett Bluff on his way to the Canadian side of Haro Strait to help look when Tom radioed to say that he had found whales off of Turn Point. Dave made it on scene around 0945.
The whales were extremely spread out. J27 was foraging in the tide rips off the point and was engaged in at least one fish chase. He was staying down a long time and was surfacing irregularly so he was hard to get a photo of. There was a juvenile foraging in the same general area that may have been J45 but he was even harder to keep track of and disappeared un-photographed. There were no other whales in sight. Around 1015, J27 looked finally committed to heading northeast up Boundary Pass which was fortunate as there was a big fog bank in Swanson Channel. Another bull finally appeared almost a mile west of J27 and this turned out to be L87. He was also traveling northeast up Boundary Pass. There were no other visible whales so Dave moved up toward Blunden Island and eventually found a few more whales off Gowland Point. J31 and J40 were foraging in the same general area and J49 was seen closer to the South Pender Island shoreline. J41 and J51 were about a half mile ahead of the others but then they pointed northeast and offshore and vanished.
Tom had left the scene before 1000 to go pick up Jane and Melisa and when “Morning Star” got back on scene, they went north towards East Point. They found most of the J16s and J19 between Narvaez Point and East Point. Dave headed up there to get some pics of the J16s before he started slowly back south to see who else might show up. Almost a half hour later, J41 and J51 were seen again pretty much in the same place they had last disappeared. Now, however, they were heading quickly southeast towards Sandy Point on Waldron Island. J31 and J40 were also seen again and they also were quickly heading toward Sandy Point. “Morning Star” radioed to report that the J16s, who had made it north of East Point, had also turned around and were heading back for Boundary Pass.
By the time the whales reached Sandy Point, J22, J37, J38, J46, and J49 had also appeared and they all filed around Sandy Point spread out in singles and pairs heading southeast. Most of these whales went deep into Cowlitz Bay, dissipated and disappeared. About ten minutes behind these whales, all of the J16s rounded Sandy Point in a loose group and also headed southeast toward San Juan Channel following the other whales. Almost a mile to the southwest, J27 and L87 were foraging in the same area. They came together briefly and were last seen at 1315 after going on a forever dive and Dave ended his part of the encounter there. “Morning Star” stayed with the whales a while longer as they headed down San Juan Channel.

Melisa, Jane, and Tom headed to Snug Harbor and left aboard ""Morning Star"" at 1235. The whale watching vessel soon left the whales so the search was on for “Morning Star” to relocate them.

At 1312, “Morning Star” found the T100s, T124As, and T124C traveling quickly east a mile east of Trial Island. As the whales porpoised past Discovery Island in rough seas, the T100s and T124As split up and regrouped multiple times. Most of the time, T124C trailed behind the group(s) by a few hundred yards but on occasion would join up with T100C or with the group(s).

By 1437, the whales were northbound in the middle of Haro Strait and had not slowed down yet. T100C and T124A3 soon split off to socialize together a few hundred yards north of the others. Once the rest of the T124As, T100s, and T124C were almost in line with Lime Kiln State Park, they turned east and headed toward the San Juan Island shoreline. T100C and T124A3 figured out the rest of the whales were now headed east and quickly turned to catch up with them.

By 1519, the T100s, T124As, and T124C were all together right off of Hannah Heights and had slowed down into a loose resting line. The encounter was ended at 1603 as the resting whales continued slowly past False Bay.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2018encounters/1

He was chatting with Jeanne Hyde on the dock when Jim Maya told him about a report of another group of whales heading east at Seabird Point. That sounded pretty tempting so Dave headed back out to help look for those whales even though Haro Strait was getting a tad sloppy. “Peregrine” and a Prince of Whales boat were also looking and we all tried to cover a little different area. Dave checked out the Beaumont Shoal area and was heading toward a large bird ball south of Seabird Point when the Prince of Whales boat found the T18s off of False Bay. So, Dave pounded his way back through uncomfortable seas and finally got on scene off Hannah Heights at 1230. The T18s were split into two pairs with T18 and T19B being loosely spread apart from one another and inshore of the other pair. T19 and T19C were about a quarter mile offshore of the others and were mostly paralleling T18 and T19B’s course up San Juan Island. By the time the T18s made it to the south end of Andrews Bay, they had all spread out although T18 and T19B remained inshore while the other two remained offshore. T19B was sporting some rake marks and a brand new V-shaped nick on his dorsal fin. This pair went deep into Mitchell Bay and were near Open Bay while the offshore pair were still off of the south end of Mitchell Bay. T19C was almost a half mile north of T19, who had dropped back to forage, before he turned back south to join his mom. However, she soon started steaming north and passed up T19C so he had to turn around and hurry back the way he had came to catch up with her.

Not long after it started getting light, Jane Cogan called Dave to let him know that the transients were still loud on the hydrophone. Dave grabbed his gear and headed for the boat while Ken scanned from the CWR deck. When Dave arrived at Snug Harbor, Tom Cogan was also jumping in his boat “Morning Star” to go look for the whales and we soon made a plan for our search. Both boats left Snug Harbor at about 0830 with “Morning Star” taking the Canadian Side of Haro Strait and “Orcinus” heading north up the American side.
Dave eventually found the whales at 0915 just south of Turn Point. It was a tight group of females and younger whales and they passed Turn Point, heading north, right on the rocks. The whales turned out to be the T49As, T75Bs, and T75Cs and they then traveled slowly northeast up Boundary Pass on a direct line for Blunden Island. T49A, T75B, and T75C all had their new calves traveling with them. We will call the new calves T49A5, T75B3, and T75C1, respectively, unless Jared Towers tells us differently. Sometimes a new calf gets seen somewhere else on the coast but dies before we see it in our area so we always check with Jared to be sure we are calling a new calf the right name. T75C’s calf looked the youngest as it had not filled out (fattened up) yet and was still lumpy looking with a wavy newborn fin-probably less than two weeks old. T75C1 also had a scratched up nose but it did not look too serious. The other two calves were a bit fatter but all three calves still had remains of fetal folds. T75B3 was quite active and breached a couple of times. The whales were easy to track on their long dives as at least one of the calves would have to come up early halfway through the long dive and gave them all away. The whales traveled in one tight group although it occasionally loosened up a little with the T49As in the lead. There was some occasional milling and the T49A juveniles dropped back a short way a few times to be social with the T75Bs and T75Cs.

I headed down to Mike 1 and left Victoria harbour at 0940 to search for them. I worked my way east along Victoria's waterfront as far as Clover Point and scanned with the binoculars. I noticed that I had missed a text from another colleague that had seen them exiting Victoria Harbour and had last seen them headed south. I worked my way offshore and spotted them in the distance north west of Constance Bank. They were too far away and finished their breathing cycle before I was able to confirm which direction they were pointing. I sat and scanned for several minutes and wasn't able to relocate them. I spoke with the pilot boat on the VHF who was approaching me on their return to Victoria harbour from Constance Bank and asked them to call me if they spotted them on their way back. They had seen them earlier when they were in Victoria harbour. I decided to push further south at slow speed after several more minutes of scanning. I then spotted a blow well south which I at first assumed was them. I shortly realized that I was chasing down a humpback. Once I got a fluke ID I continued scanning in all directions. The trail was getting cold by this time and I saw the Clipper IV south of Trial Island heading for Victoria so I spoke with them on the VHF to see if they had seen them. They hadn't but said they would also call if they did on their way to Victoria. I decided that I would push as far west as Race Rocks as their was a strong ebb which could have taken them that far by this time. I stopped at the south edge of Race Rocks Ecological Reserve and scanned for several minutes before looping back through Race Pass and worked my way back towards Victoria favouring the Vancouver Island shoreline.

Other than a splash seen over a mile to the southwest of him, no other whales were seen in J27’s vicinity. Since J27 was taking long deep dives, Dave soon left him and headed in the direction of the splash seen previously. J47 was found and he milled around but would not arch for an ID shot. Another whale was seen about a quarter mile to the southwest of J47 and this was probably J35. A group appeared over a half mile to the west of J47.

This group was active and were heading south-southwest in a slow, boisterous manner with the occasional brief burst of speed. The group did loosen up some and J36 and J39 drifted off to the northwest and did not return. J31 drifted off to the southeast and then did come back to the group of J37, J40, J46, J49, and J51. This group was still active and there were a few sporadic cartwheels. J35 appeared and joined the group. The whales headed south-southwest and were aiming right for Seabird Point on Discovery Island.
As the group were abeam of Baynes Channel, more whales in small groups and individuals started to show up to the west and northwest. All the whales were aiming for Seabird Point so they began to funnel together. J19 appeared a little ahead of the big group before she joined it. J45 and J47 also appeared rather suddenly and joined the group. The J22s were a little to the west with the rest of the J17s behind them.

J16, J26, and J50 were spotted grouped up over near Flattop Island at 1453. The three were traveling toward Limestone Point while J19 and J42 paralleled them a few hundred yards away to the east.

“Morning Star” headed south down San Juan Channel in search of whales that had not been seen yet. At 1530, J45 and L87 were encountered as they foraged and headed south together right off of Point Caution. J27 circled further out in the middle of the channel and then also turned south. J38 was southbound a few hundred yards ahead of J27.

J31, J35, J40, J46, and J47 were found milling and logging in front of Friday Harbor together. J31 and J46 then split off and started heading back up the channel close to the Shaw Island shoreline. J38 almost joined up with J35, J40, and J47 but turned and headed back up the channel too. J27 was northbound as well.

The T101s were in a tight group and they made a brief jog to the east before turning southwest toward the north Spieden Island shoreline. The whales came up from a long dive in mid-New Channel with T101B having moved off a couple hundred yards to the southwest of the others but he rejoined the other three whales shortly after. The T101s milled briefly and T101 did one reverse surfacing so they may have been feeding on something they had killed earlier but it was hard to tell for certain.

A little after 8am, Jane Cogan called Dave to say that she was hearing whales on the hydrophone and Tom found them in the spotting scope while we were talking. Dave headed down to the boat and left Snug Harbor at 9am. Less than ten minutes later, the first whales were seen just north of CWR. L88 was the first whale visually identified and he was several hundred yards in front of the others and moved off to the northwest. The other whales were the L54s and L84 and they were spread out and actively foraging off Smugglers Cove and the south end of Mitchell Bay. By about 0940, the L54s had grouped up and were now fast traveling north up Haro Strait. L84 was as much as half a mile southeast of the L54s but he charged north and caught up to them by about 1020. L88 reappeared north of Gooch Island well over on the Canadian side of the strait and, he too, was fast traveling north towards Moresby Island and Swanson Channel. Since the first boats of the day were arriving on scene, Dave left L88 off the southeast tip of Moresby Island with the others about a mile to the southeast at about 1050.
It seemed odd that only those five whales were around since Jeanne had heard J pod whales in the night so Dave went north up Swanson Channel to find more whales. Sure enough, at about 1105, Dave saw more whales north of Mouatt Point on North Pender Island. J pod and L87 were spread out and heading north in groups and individuals from the North Pender shoreline to about mid-channel. The whales continued north toward Active Pass and by about 1200, J pod and L87 were all together in a loose group along the shoreline. Dave ended the encounter with them a quarter mile south of the Pass shortly after with hopes of re-finding the five Ls on the way home.
Fifteen minutes later, the L54s, L84, and L88 were found again north of James Point on North Pender Island in a tight group heading slowly north. By this time, J pod and L87 had been reported to have entered well into Active Pass before turning around and then coming back out before heading north up Trincomali Channel. The L54s, L84, and L88 continued north and, by 1250, had hit the Mayne Island shoreline about a quarter of a mile south of Active Pass. The Ls entered the pass and Dave followed them almost halfway through it before ending the encounter at 1303.

Since the whales were spread out and it was a nice Fall day, the plan was for Ken and Gail to go out in “Shachi” and Dave would go out in “Orcinus”. We all left Snug at about 1305 and were on scene ten minutes later with whales spread out off the south end of Andrews Bay and farther south. Unfortunately, “Shachi” developed throttle problems and had to limp back in to Snug Harbor with “Orcinus” following in case help was needed. “Shachi” made it safely to Snug and Dave left again on “Orcinus” and was on scene with the whales again by about 1350.
The whales were still spread out in singles and small groups. Most of the whales were pointed south or southwest but none of them really seemed to be going anywhere. Several individual whales were seen abruptly changing directions like they had encountered a fish and then a chase would ensue. A small group that included the J19s and J31 were seen. L87 and J45 were also seen interacting with one another. The five members of the J16s were milling together about a mile or so in front of CWR after J26 joined the other four from the west. The J16s were one of the larger groups and they continued slowly south. A bull was seen to the north of the J16s that couldn’t have been one of the J pod males or L87 and, surprisingly, this turned out to be L84. This was the first time L84, L88, and the L54s had made it all the way in to Haro Strait in 2017 although they had been seen several times off the southwest coast of Vancouver Island. CWR also had an encounter with the five of them with other L pod whales near Race Rocks on June 12th. L84 was traveling slowly south by himself. The L54s were about a half mile to the northwest of L84. These three were milling and loosely spread at first but soon came together and began traveling southwest. L88 was a couple hundred yards ahead of the L54s. By about 1505, L88 was angling back to the southeast toward SJI when he abruptly changed direction to the north and began chasing a fish.
Almost a mile to the northwest, an active group of Dall’s porpoises were riding whale watch boats bow waves when they suddenly broke off from the boats and streaked southeast toward the L54s and a few others. Four or five Dall’s rooster-tailed among L54, L117, and L88 for several minutes about a mile southwest of CWR. L54 split off and then J44 and J47 joined a loose play group with L88, L108, and L117. J27 and L87 were seen rolling around together about a mile to the south. J27 and L87 soon split up but they were still foraging in the same general area. Back with the play group, J45, J49, J38, and J39 joined J44 and J47 for an all-male play group with L88 and L108 following closely behind.

By mid-morning, Dave was waiting just east of Danger Shoal for “Sea Hunt” to come out of Mosquito Pass when reports began coming in of a group of transients near Seabird Point. Since “Sea Hunt” was running well, Ken told Dave he could take off and go see some whales so “Shachi” headed off in the direction of Beaumont Shoal.
Dave arrived on scene a little before 1100 about a half mile east of Beaumont Shoal. The group of Ts were surfing in the wake of a freighter when “Shachi” first arrived but soon slowed back down to normal speed while they traveled north up Haro Strait.

About the same time T65A2 began porpoising, the T65Bs and T123s were reported to have begun chasing a Dalls porpoise. By the time Dave got back over to the group, the T65Bs were in hot pursuit of a porpoise and porpoising southeast down island off Hannah Heights. The T123s were following behind by a couple hundred yards. The T65Bs eventually ran the porpoise down and the T123s joined them in feeding on the carcass. Afterwards there were a couple of half breaches and tail lobs out of the younger whales and T65B spy hopped once.

J38 came from offshore and passed us on his way inshore at the south end of Mitchell Bay. The whales were very spread out and, after a scan with binocs, we realized that a group of whales had got by us and were up near Kellett Bluff. We headed up that direction to find that the whales up there were the J16s and J19s and they were now headed south in Mitchell Bay just a little north of Snug Harbor. The J19s and J42 were tight together while J16 and J50 were about fifty yards to the west and J26 was traveling just a little behind those two. We could still hear blows behind us back toward Open Bay so we dropped back to see who was back there. J36 and L105, loosely spread, came steaming south from near the shoreline on the east side of the entrance of Open Bay and L72 was briefly seen a couple of hundred yards in front of them.
We then decided to head offshore and down island to see what other whales we could find. We found J27 traveling slowly south by himself about mid-strait in front of CWR. More offshore whales did not materialize so we headed back inshore toward Bellevue Point. Here, we found J45, J47, L87, and L116 spread out and traveling slowly south. J45 and L116 were seen milling briefly near a kelp mat. J39 was seen farther offshore from these whales. Behind these whales back near Smallpox Bay, all the J16s along with J19 were traveling south in a tight group. The L72s were just a little offshore of the J16s and J19.

This was L47, L72, L91, L105, L115, and L122 and they were spread out in loose pairs as they milled about and slowly headed north.

By 10:36, more whales could be seen back at Bellevue Point so “Orcinus” dropped back and found L83, L90, L92, and L110. They were also spread out as they slowly headed north. Eventually, L83 and L110 came together, while L90 remained inshore and L92 slightly offshore. With reports of more whales spread out further down the island, L83, L90, L92, and L110 were left half a mile southwest of Sunset Point at 11:09.

At 11:36, “Orcinus” arrived on scene with L89 as he slowly milled around by himself a mile and a half southwest of Eagle Point. After a few quick proof of presence shots, “Orcinus” headed over to take a look at L94, L113, and L121 as they foraged a mile off the north end of South Beach. By 12:03, L77 and L119 came into view as they quickly traveled southeast. “Orcinus” paralleled the loose pair for a bit, got a perfect ID shot from L77 after she breached, and then split off to find more whales.

L41 was found 4 miles south of Cattle Point by 12:20 and was also traveling. Further southeast, L85 was spotted and after a long deep dive, gave the perfect arch for another excellent ID shot. L85 continued to mill around for some time, about 4 miles south of Long Island before committing to traveling southeast. L77 and L119 then caught up to L85 but did not join him. All three whales were now 4-5 miles southwest of Iceberg Point. At one point, L119 paused to fool around in some bull kelp.

At 13:22, “Orcinus” found the L94s again as they slowly headed south 5-6 miles south of Cattle Point. Soon after, L22 was found 5-6 miles south of South Beach traveling south, then back north. North of L22 was L89 again and he was milling around. ""Orcinus"" ended the encounter at 13:54 with L89 still milling in the same area.

Ken had also got the whale report and he and Gail got off the dock and on scene with the whales first in “Shachi”. “Orcinus” left a little while later and got on scene a mile or so southwest of Tiptop Hill on Stuart Island at about 1100.
The first whales the crew in “Orcinus” saw were the J19s, L77s, J39, and L85. These whales were loosely spread in small groups and singles and were traveling south at a high rate of speed. There were short bouts of porpoising but the whales occasionally stalled out to mill briefly before continuing south. Behind these whales were the J14s and J31 and they also hurried south in a fairly tight group. Behind the J14s and J31, scattered pairs and singles of the rest of the L12s began to form up. The L22’s, L94’s, L41, and L25 soon joined into a tight group that was traveling fast southeast towards Kellett Bluff. L113 breached once and L22 did two half-breaches. We left them a couple miles west of Battleship Rock at around 1130 and looked for the another group. The next group of whales behind the L12s were J17, J44, and J53. Some other whales to the southwest of the J17s ended up being the L77s and L85 again. L87 was about a half mile west of the J17s and J46 appeared to the southeast of the boat and milled around a bit until she joined the J17s. L87 also came over from the west and joined the J17s and they all headed south at a pretty good clip. Other scattered whales we ran into were to be members of the L12s again who must have stalled out and milled once they had passed us earlier.
We waited off Mitchell Bay for a bit to see if we could find anymore whales that were not J pod or the L12s. About fifteen minutes later, more whales showed up from the north spread out in singles and small groups. L72 and L105 blew by us and then K14 and K42 followed behind them. K22 and L86 were in a tight pair a couple hundred yards to the northwest of them. K12, K26, K33, L82, L83, L110, L90, and L92 were all seen spread out traveling by themselves.

For the first time in more than two months, a large assemblage of Southern Resident Killer Whale pods has returned to the interior waters of the Salish Sea. This population has dramatically decreased in number in recent years, and this summer was unprecedented by their almost complete absence in the core area of their summer habitat around the San Juan Islands where they occurred almost daily in previous years. Their frequent occurrence in this habitat for the past half century earned them the name “resident”, given to them by Dr Mike Bigg early in his pioneering study of ‘killer whales’ in the 1970s. These are extremely vivacious and charismatic animals, as indigenous to the Pacific Northwest as its original human inhabitants, and they migrated to the region at the end of the last Ice Age for the same reason as the people – to feast upon the salmon that were available year-round in unbelievable abundance during the myriad of their anadromous ‘runs’ to the rivers that drained the rain and snow and ice melt from the majestic mountains of Cascadia. The story of this very complex ‘web of life’ is fascinating, and was reputedly told to Governor Stevens in 1854 upon ceding much of the territory upon which the indigenous people had lived for millennia to the white ‘settlers’. Whether or not the Chief Seattle speech is authentic, the ‘web of life’ story is a tenet of ecology and it is eloquently presented in many of the 1854 speech renditions; and, whether or not we believe the tenet is true, the whales have always been its most reliable indicator: “No blackfish, No fish”, as the saying went in historic times. No fish, no blackfish (SRKW) is the current interpretation.
 Enough prologue. For several weeks there have been reports of whales coming in off Jordan River in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and whale watch boats have been dutifully going west from Victoria to hopefully encounter incoming residents. But, each time it has turned out that the whales that are found are Bigg’s Transient killer whales, and we now have a record number of sightings and encounters of this ecotype in Salish Sea waters. Today, however, Mark Malleson was able to confirm that incoming whales he encountered west of Sheringham lighthouse at 1030 AM were RESIDENTS!! We decided to launch in two waves, with “Shachi” leaving Snug Harbor at 1128 as the whales were reported to be nearing Otter Point, and “Orcinus” departing a couple of hours later if the whales came in as far as Victoria. “Shachi” encountered the lead group of whales at 1310 just east of Secretary Island, and the first whale identified was J19, who seems to have taken over as leader after the passing of J2 in the winter of 2015/16. The Js were in several matriline groups closest to the shoreline of Vancouver Island; the Ks were in loose matriline groups a little farther offshore and a little behind the Js. The Ls that were present were very spread out in matriline groups much farther behind and farther offshore. There was some foraging activity going on with all groups conducting occasional sprints into churning tidal waters (the tidal currents in the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca had gone from big ebb to big flood with a very brief slack at 1205). The salmon tend to move into the Salish Sea with the flood tides, and hang back in nearshore eddies and bays in ebb tides, so the whale foraging and travelling east suggested that there were at last sufficient numbers of salmon to bring them all of the way in. It was interesting to see that J and K pod whales came easterly through Race Passage, while L pod whales came easterly to the south of Race Rocks as far as mid-strait.
 “Orcinus” departed Snug Harbor as the lead whales approached Trial Island off Victoria to encounter them just west of Discovery Island, while “Shachi” went in to Oak Bay to “Hoover” Mark Malleson’s photos from the morning. We have seen SRKWs so seldom lately that we wanted to be sure to get as many photos as possible to verify which whales were there. After the “Hoover”, we headed back out into Haro Strait where the crews of “Orcinus” and “Shachi” continued to take photos of whales until sunset, by which time they were directly in front of the Center for Whale Research on San Juan Island. Between our five photographers we took over 3,500 photographs and documented all of J pod present (24 whales), all of K pod present except K13 that is undoubtedly deceased (18 whales), and 22 L pod whales (13 whales from L pod were not seen or photographed today, but that is not alarming because they are from matrilines that were not represented in this assemblage). It is not unprecedented for L pod matrilines to be very widely separated at times – e.g., part of the pod in Puget Sound while others are off California! All of the whales today appeared to be frisky and in good condition, though we clearly have a few runts in the youngest cohort of whales – probably having been in perinatal nutritional distress due to recent poor salmon years in the Salish Sea.
Postscript: The SRKWs spent all of 5 September spread out in small groups in the Georgia Strait region of the Salish Sea, just out of range for reasonable CWR encounter; and, most of them returned south to Haro Strait on 6 September for Encounter 74.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2017encounters/73

Mark Malleson, who was out on his morning whale watch trip, said there were a lot of whales out there so Dave grabbed his gear and headed down to the boat and left Snug Harbor at 1135. Right outside Snug Harbor off the south end of Mitchell Bay, two Pacific white-sided dolphins came streaking over to ride the bow of the boat. For about eight minutes, the pair played around the bow and stern wake as the boat chugged north at a slow speed. One of the dolphins had healed killer whale rake marks on it so it had been lucky enough to survive an attack earlier in its life.
Dave soon moved on and headed for the transients off Victoria and arrived on scene with the first group several miles south of the Chain Islets at 1235. This was the T11s and T46Bs and they were in a loose group heading slowly east. Since there was another group about a mile behind this group, Dave soon left the first group and went to the second group. The second group was the T37As and the T65As and they were also traveling east in a loose group. Another group had been found a couple miles north closer to the Victoria waterfront that consisted of the T60s, T124Ds, and T124A1. These whales were heading west in a loose group when the boat first got there but they then turned back northeast.
Another group of transients had been found coming in west of Race Rocks so Dave moved on to that group and arrived at Race Rocks at 1355. A group of about nine whales were cruising around inside the park. On the northwest side of Race Rocks, a large raft of upset Steller sea lions were in the water keeping an eye on the transients as they passed closely by. The whales finally exited the park on the east side and headed north towards William Head. This group ended up being the T109s (minus the T109As) and the male with them was T69C. T69C seems to be taking a break from traveling with his mother and younger siblings as Dave had seen the rest of the T69s about two weeks before up around northern Vancouver Island and T69C had not been with them then either. The T109s and T69C traveled in a loose group toward the Vancouver Island shoreline, stopping once in a kelp bed near shore. They may have made a kill there as there were several tail lobs and large splashes as the whales milled in the kelp. The encounter with this group ended at 1505 about a half mile west of Albert Head with the whales still heading west near the shoreline in a loose group.
On the way home, the T60s, T124Ds, and T124A1 were encountered again in Haro Strait about three quarters of a mile east of the Beaumont Shoal at 1555. This group was traveling north in a loose group and angling toward San Juan Island. Dave left this group at 1623 a couple miles of Edwards Point. The T60’s, T124Ds, and T124A1 later passed by CWR at about 1720.
After he ended his afternoon trip, Mark went back out on “Mike 1” and encountered yet another group of transients mid-Juan de Fuca Strait off Cresent Bay around 1800. These whales were the T46s and T46Cs and they were heading west. This group put the total number of transients photographed this day by Mark and Dave at 45.

We arrived at 1247 and a minute later the whales surfaced a few hundred yards offshore, backlit in the mid-day sun. I took a few long-shot photos in case the whales disappeared again, but with the backlighting and the pixelation the pictures could just as well been of Loch Ness monsters; so I dropped behind them and guessed where they might again surface in the Channel. They came up right on cue, and ten minutes later the job was done as the four T36As passed us by heading back toward Point Doughty. Though it would be interesting to stay with Ts for an extended period of time to observe their predation rate and behavior, it consumes our authorized “takes” (every instance in which we are within 200 yards of a whale) that I am conserving for when the Residents return to the Salish Sea.

The factors that set this upside-down situation in motion began to occur decades ago with human overfishing, habitat destruction, and ecosystem-altering dams; and, now Mother Nature is trying to bring the ecosystem into balance by sending in the troops of seal-eating Transient killer whales to reduce the competition for the fish (seals are currently blamed by humans for the salmon ‘problem’, but they take nowhere as much biomass of salmon as humans). Mother Nature and the Ts probably do not know the salmon problem is due to human fault, but we had best not consider ourselves exempt from the laws of nature. Don’t be worried about the Ts bothering humans, but do be concerned with anthropogenic climate change and its far-ranging effects.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2017encounters/69

There had also been an earlier report of the T137s and others coming south near Pt. Roberts. Dave grabbed his gear and headed down to the boat and left Snug Harbor at 1235. After heading through the middle of the San Juan Islands, the boat arrived on scene near the Pea Pod Rocks in Rosario Strait at 1340. The T100s, T124Ds, and T124A1 were in a tight group heading south at a medium speed. Around that time, “Triton” had found another group of transients near Barnes and Clark Islands. Since the T100s, T124Ds, and T124A1 were heading south into slightly lumpy seas, Dave left this group at 1355 about a half mile south of Pea Pod Rocks and headed for the other group.
The new group turned out to be the T46s who were in a tight group traveling slowly southeast about a half mile west of Lawrence Point on Orcas Island. Dave only stayed for one pass and let them file past him at 1415. “Triton” had moved on and found yet another group of whales, including the T137s, north of Sucia Island. Dave headed there next and arrived on scene at 1437 about halfway between Sucia and Matia Islands. The whales were traveling southeast toward the north side of Matia Island with one larger tight group and a few individuals loosely spread out a little to the southwest. The other whales with the T137s turned out to be T36 and the T37As, including T137A1 who does not always travel with its mom and siblings. The group moved quickly along the north side of Matia Island before angling southeast, grouping up, and passing between Matia and Puffin Islands. The whales milled in the gap between the islands and may have made a kill there around 1455 before continuing on in a southeast direction. As he was traveling, T137A arched and acted like he could have been feeding on something and, while they were traveling toward the Barnes and Clark Islands, T36 and T137 were seen with chunks of something in their mouths. The whales hit the west side of Barnes Island and headed south along its shoreline before turning southeast again toward Lawrence Point.

Around noon one of the reports was of a small group of these “black and whites” heading south in Haro Strait near Battleship Island, a mere four miles from our homeport of Snug Harbor in Mitchell Bay, San Juan Island. We launched at 1228 and headed into mid strait off Kellett Bluff, Henry Island and encountered the whales at 1247. Almost immediately it was apparent that one of the whales had a very distinctive notched appearance to the dorsal fin, which permitted its identification as T99B; and, before long its mom and siblings were also identifiable in the photos we took. We only stayed with them for four surfacings as they dove for three to four minutes in a fairly regular southbound pattern, mostly travelling but occasionally spread out as if foraging. The radio was crackling with news of another group of Bigg’s Transient killer whales heading north about three miles southwest of the T99s over by Kelp Reef, so we headed for the latter group to document a calf that was reported among them (Encounter 64). It was interesting that these two groups of whales passed each other going in opposite directions only about a mile apart at CPA (closest point of approach), like ships passing in the night. They were obviously too far apart to see each other underwater, and they gave no clue that they heard each other (Transients are usually swimming silently when foraging – perhaps so seals cannot hear them). The T99s were seen the following day (22 August) heading west near Race Rocks in company with the T36Bs, in witness to the interesting social network of the Transient ecotype whales, different from that of the Resident ecotype.

However, that hope was soon dashed when two very distinctive adult males in the group were identified – T46D and T46E. The group turned out to be the T46 matriline with T122 in company, along with T34, T36 and T37 and kin; and, they continued eastward past Seabird Point on Discovery Island toward San Juan Island by mid-day before turning northwest in Haro Strait, passing the Center for Whale Research shortly before 1300. They were at that time offshore at a distance of over a mile, and we could not specifically identify individuals other than T46D and T46E at that distance, so we set forth in “Shachi” for a brief photo reconnaissance to confirm group composition for our records. This is a continuation of a very remarkable summer in which Bigg’s Transient whales have dominated the encounters we or the whale-watching public have had. We are just keeping track of these sightings and encounters, and will make a summary report available to the public later this year.
No Fish, No Blackfish, at least of the resident kind. There are reports from ocean fishermen of ‘salmon’ finally moving toward the west entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but these have been mostly pink salmon. There were 11 adult Chinook salmon caught in a test fishery off Port San Juan (west entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca) on 19 August, and 88 “jacks” the day before, as compared with 173 Sockeye and 1,419 Pink salmon in the same two days. The Sockeye salmon are just starting to show up in the Albion Test Fishery in the Fraser River system, and a dozen Chinook have been caught there in the same recent two days. In way of comparison, forty-five Chinook were caught at Albion during a comparable time-frame in 2000; sixty-two were caught in 2010 during a comparable time-frame; and, twenty-nine were caught in a comparable time frame in 1981 when the test fishery started. In these early years of test fisheries, the human harvest of Chinook salmon utilizing the Strait of Juan de Fuca averaged 1,498,000 adult fish per year (average weight 15-17.5 pounds), and peaked at 1,918,000 Chinook caught! The average US dollar value per fish at the time was $29-33 (about $2 per pound). Times have changed, for fishermen and for whales. For Southern Resident Killer Whale survival, it behooves us to manage this Salish Sea ecosystem to return to a significant salmon biomass of natural run salmon to feed the whales, the forests, and the people. Chief Sealth said it clearly, “all things are connected”. We have a lot of ecosystem repairing to do, and the Bigg’s Transient whales are doing their part to bring the seal population (salmon predators) into balance, but they cannot help with dam removal and riparian habitat restoration for the salmon.

We finally arrived on scene about four miles south of Discovery Island at about 1100. The whales were in a fairly tight group pointed east at first but soon turned south. The whales zig-zagged quite a bit but generally headed south or southeast. T10C and T60C often dropped behind the others to socialize with one another. We left the whales around 1245 about seven miles south-southeast of Discovery Island with the whales temporarily pointed west although we heard that the whales later continued southeast.

T10B was not present during this encounter. We only know of a few T10 encounters in 2017 but T10B has not been seen since 2016. It is possible that he has dispersed and may be traveling on another part of the coast but it seems unlikely given that he has remained with his mom for so long into adulthood. We fear he might be gone but we will continue to keep an eye out for him just in case he is only taking a break from his mother and little brother.

Also, T60C appears to have had someone or something bite him near the top of his dorsal fin. There was a deep gouge on the forward top of the fin along with a new small little flapper above his old nick. The wound has also giving him a new kink to left at the top of his fin that may or may not be permanent.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2017encounters/61

The seas were glass calm with about three to four foot westerly swell during the crossing from PA to Race Rocks, but the air was extremely smoky due to forest fires that have raged this past week in British Columbia and in Washington State. The whales were reported to be in two groups heading easterly, so we aimed for the area where we thought we might find the trailing group in the vicinity of Race Rocks by the time we arrived. They were actually already past Race Rocks and heading easterly when we encountered the trailing group at 1222. This group consisted of L90, L91 and her son L122, L92, L72 and her son L105, L83 and her son L110, L47 and her son L115. After a quick inventory of whales, we left the whales and headed toward the leaders that were then off Trial Island. This group was the L4s in a group, but they soon spread apart off Seabird Discovery Island and headed toward False Bay San Juan Island. A container ship transited westbound directly in their path and provided “surf” for several of the whales for about one minute. The water pressure ridge created by the bulbous bow and mass of the ship created a six foot wave that three of the whales rode briefly while creating “rooster-tails” of spray from their dorsal fin.
The whales had spread over a very broad area by the time they reached the shores of San Juan Island and they spent the rest of the day very spread out as far as Iceberg Point on Lopez to Hannah Heights San Juan Island by sunset. They were heard by Jeanne Hyde on the Lime Kiln hydrophone for three hours in the middle of the night. In the morning of 4 August they were reported heading west near Race Rocks, thus ending yet another brief encounter with SRKWs in the Salish Sea this year.

Today, however, we happened to get an early afternoon report of a small group of Ts between Ediz Hook and Dungeness Spit not far from our new auxiliary launch site in Port Angeles. Though the report was in the afternoon it was feasible with glass-calm seas to go out and check it out in hopes that it would turn out to be the “exotics”. It was, and by the time we caught up with them they were travelling with some of the T46Bs in a small group of five whales foraging just south of Eastern Bank and travelling toward Admiralty Inlet. The “exotics” are T117 and her presumed son T120, and this is the first time we have seen them in the Salish Sea, though they may have been here and not seen/identified. The T117s have been documented in recent years in the Johnstone Strait region by Jared Towers, and were first identified by John Ford in that area in 1990; but, they have only been seen occasionally anywhere. For this reason they have been given the moniker “exotic”, but they are no different than others of their ecotype. Their appearance in the core Salish Sea region represents a continuation of a very remarkable incursion of the Bigg’s Transient ecotype whales into the Salish Sea in recent years. We have documented nearly 200 whales of this population in the Salish Sea in this year alone! Their total population is now more than 250, and they are remarkably successful at producing babies with their numbers growing while the “Southern Resident” ecotype population is dwindling. This is a classic demonstration by Mother Nature of predator/prey relationships – any natural predator population must exist within the “carrying capacity” of its food source. In this case, the food supply of the Transient ecotype whales (mostly harbor seals) is currently abundant due to their rebound from culling in the 1960s, and the food supply of the Resident ecotype whales (mostly Chinook salmon) is dangerously scarce due to extreme overfishing in the 1970s and 80s together with management policies that prioritize economic metrics over ecological metrics. That is to say, we humans are managing resources for human economic benefit, not for sustainable ecological health. For example, in the 1980s, after grossly overfishing Chinook salmon destined for Salish Sea rivers (human harvest of 1.4 to 1.9 million natural run Chinook per year), the management policy shifted toward hatchery production and smolt release timing of these fish to favor a recreational sport fishery of Chinook that were more residential to these waters – hence fishing licenses could be sold to the public like fees for fishing in an artificially stocked pond. It is safe to say that no attention was paid by management for the ecological needs of the salmon predators – they were the enemies of fishermen.
 Another extremely arrogant resource management policy was to dam rivers to produce electricity for human convenience and distribute water for agriculture, etc. with the full and transparent knowledge that salmon required these rivers for their anadromous reproductive cycle. The Congress of the United States forbade the management agencies from preventing salmon access to their requisite spawning habitats, but the agencies (Bureau of Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers) went ahead and blocked their access anyway. Hatcheries to produce ‘factory fish’ were offered to mitigate the damage wrought by dams, but they have only increased the problem by messing up the genetics of natural populations of fish that adapted to the rivers through natural selection. The hatchery fish are smaller, costly to produce, and in the long run not sustainable. Hence, populations of whales that depend upon these fish are not sustainable. In essence, management policies of the past and to this day spell sayonara to the Resident ecotype killer whales and hello to a very uncertain future in which Mother Nature will play the last hand. It is happening now, along with other inconvenient truths. It is simply our job to document the situation with respect to killer whales in this Salish Sea ecosystem, and that we will do for as long as we can. It is up to all of us to exercise our sapience to bring our knowledge into conformity with the processes of natural reality in a world that is much bigger and more complex than humans can scarcely comprehend.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2017encounters/59

The T18s had been found in the morning west of Race Rocks and steadily moved east. The whales were in Haro Strait by early afternoon and were at the south end of Andrews Bay by 1510. A few minutes later the whales were deep in the bay and patrolling the rocks and kelp around Low Island. They then continued north with T19C surfacing right at Sunset Point. The whales went on a long dive off Sunset Point and then T19 and T19B came up right outside reef in front of CWR at 1321. That pair surfaced a couple of times near the reef and then disappeared. Then T18 came up well inside the reef and Dave and Stewart, who were watching from the porch, wondered anxiously where T19C would surface. T19C soon surprised us both when he surfaced just a couple of dozen yards off the rocks. He was much closer to the shoreline than the reef and Dave had never seen a transient come that close to the shore here in front of CWR before.

Once the whales had passed the Center by 1525, Dave and Stewart grabbed their gear and met Michael down at the boat. We left Snug Harbor at 1555 only to immediately find out that the T18s were heading into Mosquito Pass. The whales apparently headed up the eastern shoreline of Henry Island but we did not see them ahead of us until they took their first right toward the turn rock in the elbow of the pass. The whales went right around the rock and went on a long dive. They next came up about a half mile south of the west end of Pearl Island aiming for the western north entrance of Roche Harbor. The whales went on another long dive before surfacing near us right in the western north entrance to the harbor at 1615. The whales were milling and obviously had a seal pinned on the bottom. By about 1622, the milling looked less like they were still after the seal and more like they made the kill inconspicuously already. While we never saw the kill, the whales acted like the deed had already done and there were several tail lobs and pec slaps-even T19B did one big lazy pec slap. The whales then started traveling northeast past the north side of Posey Island and then more easterly toward Barren Island. T19C was seen shaking while he traveled so it was believed that they may have eaten that seal on the way to Barren Island. The whales next surfaced working the shoreline of Barren Island and passing right next to scared harbor seals trying to stay out of the way on the rock. The whales then worked the kelp bed just to the east of Barren Island and may have made another kill since we could smell a little blubber oil in the air. Giles, who was on the poop boat behind the action, reported seeing lots of small seal pieces floating around behind so the whales definitely ate more at that spot but we could not confirm if they made a new kill or were just finishing off their old kill. The T18s then started steaming east in Spieden Channel and we left them at 1655 off the west end of Davison Head at the top end of San Juan Island. While we were on the T18s, Ken was out in “Chimo” on another group of transients in the southeastern part of Juan de Fuca Strait.

We headed north around Turn Point where we noticed boats heading east toward Flattop Island and nothing to the north coming down Boundary Pass. After asking on the radio what was going on, we found out that the Js and Ls coming down Boundary Pass on the Canadian side turned into a group of transients coming down Boundary on the Waldron Island side. After taking the long way, we eventually arrived on scene about three quarters of a mile east of White Rock at 1310. The T34s, T37, T37Bs, and the T46s were traveling southeast fairly quickly in a tight group toward Jones Island. The whales rounded Jones Island close to the southwest shoreline and then briefly angled a bit more south into San Juan Channel.

L55 appeared near the group of four with the L123s in it before she moved slowly off to the north by herself. By about 0950, L116 had joined L106 and L109 near Eagle Point and this group was playful and socializing while paralleling the slow traveling foursome of L86, L118, and the L123s.

First, Dave headed up Haro Strait a little to the east of Halibut and Gooch Islands and then headed west under Moresby Island to west of Portland Island. From there, Dave went back east across lower Swanson, past Bedwell Harbor and up Boundary Pass near the S. Pender and Saturna Island’s shorelines. The water in Boundary Pass was pretty lumpy except for the Narvaez Bay area on Saturna Island. The water flattened out with a bit of a roll near East Point but the water in the Patos/Sucia Islands direction where Dave had planned to go looked a little too excited to be worth searching while it looked beautiful to the northwest so he went that way instead. It was flat calm from Tumbo Channel to past Active Pass and halfway up the Galiano Island shoreline. Since it was so nice north of Active Pass and not yet 10am, Dave continued north about a mile off the Galiano Island shoreline. Once there, Dave did a little loop north and east of Porlier Pass for a final look and was going to head home when Mark Malleson called and said there was a group of Ts heading south north of Nanaimo. The nice water had been replaced by one and two footers, the sky had become overcast, and the whales were still Gabriola Island away but the water wasn’t too bad, there was plenty of day left, and Dave was pretty sure he was okay on fuel, so he kept going north to meet the whales.
Vancouver whale watch boats had been passing to the north and could be seen stopping miles ahead and Dave finally got on scene at 1020 about a mile or so south of Entrance Island off the north end of Gabriola Island to find the T37As and the T77s coming south in a loose group before stopping and milling. There was a second bull in the area who headed inshore right before arrival and Dave never saw him despite the whale watch boats occasionally catching glimpses of him far to the periphery of the group. We suspect this male was T51. The T37As and the T77s soon started milling and it was clear they had a seal trapped. There was an extended attack on the harbor seal that took about fifteen minutes with several whales taking swipes at the seal. After they made the kill, the whales began moving slowly south with quite a bit of milling. There were numerous breaches and spy hops as the whales fed while as they milled around. Dave ended the encounter at 1110 about three miles south of Entrance Island with the whales still feeding and pointed slowly south. Dave went through Gabriola Pass and headed home down Trincomali Channel on the inside of the Gulf Islands to avoid an increasingly lumpy Georgia Strait and made it to the Roche Harbor fuel dock shortly before 1400.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2017encounters/51

A dozen harbor seals were hauled out or hauling out on the reef in front of the Center for Whale Research and a few more were in the water as the whales rounded Bellevue Point and non-chalantly proceeded past them a couple hundred yards away. The seals seemed aware of potential danger and were glancing out over the water, but the closest approach of the whales was made underwater and they surfaced in a group a few hundred yards northwest of CWR. Sometimes the tactic is to have one or two of the whales lag behind and catch an unaware seal when it thinks the danger has passed. Apparently the whales were not hungry in this pass. Distant identification photos were made of the whales from the porch, and then Ken launched in “Shachi” from Snug Harbor in hope of obtaining some well-lit right side identification photos in the relatively calm water. A few photos were taken, but the whales were conducting long unpredictable dives off Open Bay and Kellett Bluff and seemed more interested in observing the stationary whalewatchers than the mobile researcher or the mobile yacht, so the encounter was cut short when the whales headed out into mid-Haro Strait into the welcome view of the whale-watching fleet. For the remainder of the day the position of this group of Bigg’s Transient whales and at least two other groups of “Ts” in the core area of the Salish Sea was dutifully recorded from reports from the fleet. There is no doubt that a truly amazing identification catalogue and database of all species of the whales and their utilization of the Salish Sea is facilitated by having so many people “tuned in” to their presence.

Dave arrived on scene at 1310 about three quarters of a mile east of Whale Rocks in Cattle Pass to find a group of six whales including T36, T51, and the T37As heading east a little north of Long Island. Another couple of groups of whales appeared to head north in San Juan Channel into Griffin Bay. The T49As were also reported to be at Beaumont Shoal. The T37As along with T36 and T51 briefly turned south-southwest once they got to the east end of Long Island but soon started milling before turning back north again. The whales hit the shoreline of the east tip of Long Island before charging back northwest on the north side of Long Island. The whales moved over to Davis Point on Lopez Island and the group then headed north up the Lopez Island shoreline and Dave left them at 1405 about a quarter mile south of Shark Reef.

There was another group milling near the north end of Griffin Bay and this turned out to be the T99s. They were milling in the same area and appeared to have a seal pinned on the bottom as the four whales were surfacing at alternate intervals. About a mile north of the T99s, another small group was heading slowly north toward Turn Island. This was the T36Bs along with T37A1. T37A1 had dispersed from the T37As and the last time we had seen the whale in early 2013, it had been traveling with its grandmother T37 and the T36s. We had seen all the T36s and T37s in the last few years and T37A1 had not been with them so it must have found other whales in other places to travel with in those years. Around 1450, the T36Bs and T37A1 began hunting a seal near the seal haul out rocks just south of Turn Island. Although Dave was a little too far away to see a confirmed kill, the whales must have made one because they soon got very active while they milled around just to the east of the seal rocks. One whale breached twice and there was other splashing and a few spyhops.

T51 soon came charging over from the Lopez Island side to join the T36Bs and then T36 and the T37As soon followed him. The T99s also caught up from the south and all the whales appeared to be being social. There was some milling as the whales briefly stalled out in the ebbing tide on the east side of Turn Island.

Sure enough, Jeanne Hyde called Ken in the wee hours of the morning to report she was hearing calls on the Lime Kiln hydrophone. Ken called Mark, who was up early scanning from shore in Victoria so he and Hanna were the first ones to get off the dock aboard “Mike 1” and find whales heading north near Salmon Bank. Ken called Dave at 6am to relay the whale reports and we all got ready to go out. Thinking that there could be J, K, and L pod whales out there, we headed out in two boats and Dave left Snug Harbor aboard “Orcinus” at 0645. Ken and Gail left aboard “Shachi” a few minutes later. We got on scene off the north end of False Bay around 0705. Members of J pod, the K14s, and L87 filed north, loosely spread out and heading toward Hannah Heights.
Mark and Hannah left soon after the other boats arrived and headed home in hopes of finding more whales. We also received a report of a group of whales pointed toward Hein Bank earlier in the morning so Dave headed that direction to see if he could find them while “Shachi” followed the Js and K14s up the west side. Dave headed down to just north of Hein Bank and took a good scan. Despite flat calm water, no other whales popped up so Dave headed back toward the whales heading north up SJI.
The Js, K14s, and L87 were spread out in small groups and individuals. The groups seemed to be quite social and there was a lot of rolling around while the individual animals looked to be foraging. The social groups would briefly porpoise north against the outgoing tide before stopping and milling around-this happened several times so the whales really weren’t going anywhere fast. Once it was clear that the only K pod whales around were the K14s, both “Shachi” and “Orcinus” ended the encounter around 0905 just a little south of CWR.

I received a call at 0645 on the morning of June 12 from a fishing guide (Johnny Chow/Gotcha Charters) out of Sooke that he saw a large group of killer whales foraging off East Sooke Park traveling east.
As I taxied out of Victoria’s harbor on Mike 1, I received another call from him at 0745 that there was another group of ~10 – 15 animals headed east off of Secretary Island.
As I approached Race Passage at 0830 I slowed down expecting to spot the lead group and sure enough they were approaching Race Passage in a tight group making only a couple of knots over the ground against the strong ebb current. They started to surf in the current generated waves in the pass before they cut across and entered Race Rocks Ecological Reserve. The worked their way throughout the reserve along the kelp beds with a few of them tail lobbing perhaps flushing the salmon out before they turned back west and looped around the south side of Great Race. I left them at 0904 south east bound near the green can buoy marking Rosedale Rock and went to look for the reported trailing group.
I made my way west bound along the shoreline of Vancouver Island and at 915 spotted a group of animals slightly east of Becher Bay between the Bedford Islands and Church Rock. It was the L12’s in a tight group also traveling east. Less than a quarter mile behind them was the L54’s along with L84 and L88.
I left them at 0955 as they exited Race Passage tight to the Bentick Island shoreline heading north east for Victoria.

Dave Ellifrit’s account of his morning with L pod.
Dave’s day started with a call from Ken around 0730 to report that he was watching a group of transients milling around Low Island. Dave dropped his Cheerios and hurried out the door in time to make it to CWR’s porch and watch the T2Cs come north from right behind Sunset Point at 0800. The T2Cs gave Ken and Dave a real nice pass by as they headed slowly north, passing right outside of the reef in front of CWR. T2C did a loop inside the reef before continuing north. After the T2Cs had passed, Dave made a quick trip home to finish breakfast only to find a message from Ken saying Mark was on L pod whales near Race Rocks. Ken left in “Shachi” and Dave followed him in “Orcinus” about half an hour later. Ken ran into rough seas off the Victoria waterfront due to an ebbing tide and called to say we should probably wait a bit as the Ls were still many miles west of Victoria on the other side of uncomfortably sloppy seas. Ken headed home to get stuff done on shore while Dave went to Roche Harbor to top off “Orcinus” with fuel. After a chat with Ken back at Snug, Dave decided to give it another try to see if the seas had calmed down and left Snug Harbor again at 1035. The water off the Victoria waterfront had calmed down some but were still lumpy when Dave finally arrived on scene at about 1135 somewhere south of Albert Head. This front group of whales was the ten L12s and they headed slowly east in a loose group. Mark, who was back on scene in a POW boat, decided to head back toward Race Rocks to see if he could find the rest of the Ls that he had seen earlier in the morning.

Mark did indeed find the rest of the Ls in one big group back near Race Rocks so Dave left the L12s at about 1220 and turned west into a stiffening breeze and even sloppier seas. It was a slow, painful boat ride back to the rear group with many jarring slams and much water over the bow and down the front of the shirt. It was the type of boat ride that knocks screws loose in both the boat and the body. However, with Marks help, Dave eventually made it to the whales by 1300 right off the south side of Race Rocks. Dave could barely see and had to stop somewhere near the scene to clean the salt water off his glasses and only then was able to look up and see how close to the scene he actually was. The rest of L pod was in one fairly tight group heading north very slowly. The passed Race Rocks on the south and east side and were pointed toward Pedder Bay. Dave stayed long enough to grab a picture of all the whales before leaving the scene at 1347. All members of L pod were photographed and accounted for.
Dave bounced back east past the waterfront, encountering a patch of calm water between Trial Island and Seabird Point before hitting another lumpy patch mid Haro Strait. The L12s had been reported to have passed Middle Bank and were headed toward SJI. Luckily, there was another calm spot near shore from Hannah Heights to Eagle Point. Dave briefly saw L25 around 1500 pointed south just south of False Bay and then L89 and L22 appeared spread out behind her and also headed south in a business-like manner.

Mark Malleson soon confirmed that there were a couple of other whales he didn’t recognize so Ken and Dave met down at Snug Harbor and left on the boat at 1100.
We arrived on scene a couple miles south of Kelp Reef at 1115. The whales were spread out in small groups and individuals. We first checked out the leaders who were a pair of females and a sprouter who was traveling a couple hundred yards to the east of the pair. All three whales were traveling north fast. The sprouter was identified by Jared Towers as T117A after Mark sent a picture to him. The pair of females were T172 and another whale that Jared later identified as T117B. To our knowledge, this was the first time that T117A and T117B were photographed in the central Salish Sea. We left the front three whales at 1152 and went to the other whales who had caught up at this point but were about a half mile to the west. As the whales approached Kelp Reef, a big group of harbor porpoise was seen just south of the reef but no obvious attack occurred. T117A, T117B, and T172 passed to the east of Kelp Reef while T170 and most of the T36As passed a bit more slowly a quarter mile to the west of the reef. T49C and T36A1 both slinked around closer to the reef but did not seem to make a kill and T49C soon moved off to the east.

After getting good ID shots on T170 and the T36As and leaving them off the southeast side of Sydney Island, we went looking for any more whales who might be in the area. We found T49C again about three quarters of a mile to the southeast as he steamed north up Haro Strait. Another mile or so to the northeast was T117B and T172 again. By about 1250, they were milling and appeared to be feeding on something. T117B did a reverse surfacing and we could smell blubber oil but could not see what they may have killed. We soon left this pair and headed back west toward the other whales nearing Halibut Island. By 1305, T117A and T36A1 had joined T170 and the rest of T36As and they were all milling a little south of Halibut Island. Here, the T36As killed a harbor porpoise and more milling ensued along with slow progress north. T49C glided through and moved off to the northeast. T170, the T36As, and T117A continued slowly north with lots of milling while loosely spread. We ended the encounter at 1325 just a little east of Halibut Island.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2017encounters/42

By mid-afternoon, the whales had made it to mid-Haro Strait and had split into two groups. One group reported as the T101s and T124As aimed for Kelp Reef and the western part of Haro Strait while another group reported as the T2Cs aimed more due north and closer to San Juan Island. Since we had not seen the T2Cs ourselves yet this year, Ken and Dave met Giles at the boat and we left Snug Harbor at 1540 to encounter them.
We arrived on scene at the south end of Andrews Bay at 1553. The whales had gone on a very long dive just prior to our arrival and for several minutes we thought they may have disappeared on us. However, Ken finally spotted them way inshore near Low Island. The T2Cs appeared to be in the middle of a kill as they milled in a loose group near a raft of thrilled kayakers. The whales soon formed up into a tight group and headed slowly north off the County Park. One of the whales may have been carrying something briefly in its’ mouth. After a long dive, T2C2 came up by himself in front of CWR. After he went down on another long dive, the others came up several hundred yards ahead of him just a little south of Smugglers Cove. They milled around and appeared to be waiting for T2C2 to catch up before going on another long dive. At the south end of Mitchell Bay, T2C1 split off from the others and later appeared briefly off the mouth of Mitchell Bay south of Kellett Bluff. T2C2 also moved offshore but did not join T2C1. T2C, T2C3, and T2C’s newest calf T2C4 moved over to the east side of the entrance to Open Bay. Here they milled around and may have made another kill since T2C1 soon joined them and we again thought we saw something in one of their mouths. These four whales soon formed a tight group and headed west and then north around the south end of Kellett Bluff along the rocks. T2C2 slowly moved toward Kellett Bluff but was still traveling behind the others. After briefly stalling out at the south end of Kellett Bluff the whales continued traveling slowly north in one tight group with T2C2 trailing behind and we ended the encounter off the bluff at 1715.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2017encounters/41

Dave eventually caught up to the whales off Hannah Heights at 0745.
The whales were very spread out-from the San Juan Island shoreline in the Kanaka/False Bay area to west of the Beaumont Shoal/Kelp Reef line. J26 was the first whale encountered and he was milling while doing only two breaths before going on a long dive. Dave left J26 after he finally took a few extra breaths before giving a half-hearted arch at 0805. About ten minutes later a couple of threesomes formed to the southeast off False Bay and other individuals began showing up too-all pointed southwest. By 0830, a large group had formed that included J22, the J16s minus J26, the J17s minus J46, the J19s, and J37s. This large tight group traveled very slowly southwest toward Seabird Point in a classic resting formation. J26 joined the large group at 0850 and the J16s moved just a wee bit ahead and on the periphery of the larger group and their surfacing’s were un-synched with the others.
At about 0925, a threesome and a pair showed up from the south. The threesome was J31, J40, and J46 and they milled a bit before joining the larger group who also began milling. The pair were L87 and J38 and they traveled north tight together until they also joined the loosening larger group. A little after 0950, a few other whales showed up from the southwest heading northeast toward the large group. J31 briefly turned back southwest to meet the new arrivals who were J27, J39, and J45. These whales also joined the large group and, after some milling, all the whales turned north and started traveling slowly back toward San Juan Island. By 1025, most of the whales were in one large loose group heading north toward Lime Kiln State Park. J22 and J38 had moved several hundred yards to the southeast of the large group where they foraged loosely spread from one another. Around 1100ish, J22 and J38 had tightened up and had moved over to the SJI shoreline near Edwards Point while the large group hit the SJI shoreline around 1115 near Deadmans Bay and began to spread out.
After leaving the J22s at 1045, Dave headed north well away from any whales and headed up to the north end of Mitchell Bay to wait for them. The J19s blew by around 1230 with J19 in the lead. They stalled out and began milling off the south end of Kellett Bluff. The next group showed up at the south end of Mitchell Bay at 1250. This was the J17s along with J40 and J45 and they were moving slowly north in a loose group with a lot of milling and socializing. J17, J44, and J53 moved a little north of the others and began rolling around together with J53 being pushed around at the surface. J17 spyhopped twice. The rest of the J17s along with J40 and J45 were also tactile and rolling around with one another. J47 did one cartwheel and he was seen playing with a piece of kelp in his mouth. Several hundred yards to the south of these whales were J31 and J39 traveling slowly north in a loose pair. All the other whales seemed to have stalled out in Andrews Bay or had moved way offshore.

Roberts later in the day. By about 1630, a large group of the Georgia Strait transients were heading south in Boundary Pass so Dave headed down to Snug Harbor and left at 1650.

Dave arrived on scene about mid-Boundary Pass a little north of Sandy Point on Waldron Island at 1715. The whales were traveling south fairly quickly and spread out in three or four tight groups. T77A and T87 were traveling together about a half mile to the northwest of the T86As, T124Ds, and T124A1. The rest of the T124As and the T100s (minus the T100Bs who were not present) were a little further to the southeast of this group. All the groups were heading south-southeast toward San Juan Channel until about 1805 when the T86As/T124Ds, along with the T100s ahead of them, turned east just south of White Rock. The T124As had moved to the east of White Rock but had now come back a little west and all the T86As, T100s, T124As, and T124Ds began energetically milling in the same spot at 1810. There was some explosive breathing from several of the milling whales but it was unclear if they made a kill or were just socializing.
While the others were milling, T77A and T87 moved closer to them and briefly passed them up. The milling whales soon started charging back southeast toward Spring Passage between Jones and Orcas Islands. The encounter ended at 1836 about a mile north of Jones Island with the whales still charging southeast loosely spread out in three or four tight groups.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2017encounters/39

They chased it around for 9 minutes before T137 finally had it in her mouth and killed it. They continued south for Gooch Island as they consumed it. T137D was the only one that showed any obvious signs of excitement with a few leaps and tail lobs.
Less than an hour after the porpoise kill as they were traveling through the pass between Gooch Island and Domville Island we noticed a Mink swimming ahead of the group. At that moment T137D picked up speed and headed towards it.
Its older sibling got in on the chase and after a couple of minutes T137D had it in its mouth.

Dave arrived on scene with the first group at Eagle Point at 1155. Here, T87 and the T124A2s were milling right off the point while they were in the process of killing a harbor seal. Another group of five whales were about a mile offshore and moved ahead of the inshore whales. After about ten minutes of milling off Eagle Point, T87 and the T124A2s began traveling north in a tight group after making their kill.

T124A2 was carrying the dead harbor seal in her mouth before, about halfway between Eagle Point and the south end of False Bay, all four whales began feeding on the carcass. It was a bloody affair as the whales stripped the hide off the seal and dismembered it as they fed. When they were finished sharing the meal, the four whales continued traveling north in a looser group. Dave left T87 and the T124A2s a little before 1230 when they were off the north end of False Bay. T87 was inshore with T124A2A and T124A2B while T124A2 was a couple hundred yards to the west of them.

Dave then moved ahead to the lead group of five whales who were off Edwards Point. This was all of the rest of the T124As, including T124A1 who has often traveled apart from the other T124As in recent years.

T86A1 traveled loosely with the T124Ds while T86A, T86A3, and T86A4 paralleled their course about a hundred meters or so to the west.
The T137s had remained behind milling and feeding before hurrying north to catch up to the others.

The next day they briefly appeared in Rosario Strait very spread out and heading up into the Strait of Georgia, passing Nanaimo by evening. On the 10th of May they were seen off Comox, and two days later they were again off Nanaimo, this time heading south toward Porlier Pass by evening. Expecting their arrival in the wee hours of morning of the 13th, I listened to the Orcasound and Lime Kiln hydrophones all night but did not hear them, and at 1000 they were finally seen heading south very spread out off Battleship Island in Haro Strait.
 Ken departed Snug Harbor at 1037 in “Chimo” and immediately encountered J36 and J37 off Mitchell Bay heading southeast very spread apart and taking long dives. Other individual whales were off at great distance and some were ahead, also heading down Haro Strait but they were too far away to identify and not surfacing often. For the first two hours, the “encounter” was very unrewarding of IDs, with poor lighting angle, dark seas and skies, and only occasional individual whales as “Chimo” cruised southeast at trolling speed near the shoreline of San Juan Island. The occasional whale-watch vessels lingered far offshore in the ebbing tide, also with very spread out whales. The comprehensive view for observing the procession of whales would have actually been better from shore, for example at Lime Kiln Whale Watch Park on San Juan Island. At 1118, “Chimo” passed by Land Bank, and at 1207 was south of Pile Point when some of the whales seemed to reverse direction off False Bay and then they moved offshore. The water conditions inshore were pretty sloppy by then in the tidal chop as the tide turned to flood at 1219, so I also moved offshore rather than wait for the trailing whales to see what they would do. The water conditions were not so sloppy in mid-Strait, so I waited on the Canada side of the border in hopes that the direction change signaled a response to the tidal change and direction of travel. At 1237, I glimpsed J27 far offshore by himself at 48 25.844N and 123 07.373 W, facing north but not going anywhere; and, by 1250 the whales were beginning to group up in his general area. Then, for about an hour the pod gradually coalesced and formed a “resting group”, zigging and zagging in various westerly and northerly directions in unison while the whale-watching fleet remained respectfully distant. I tried to take a few ID photos during this rare time together, but the whales barely raised their backs enough to see their “saddles”, and they kept changing direction.
 With the whales meandering undecided in the vicinity of Beaumont Shoals, I left at 1350 and headed to Port Angeles, arriving at 1505. Mark and Hanna Malleson launched in “Mike 1” late in the afternoon and observed the whales very spread out off Clover Point, Victoria, heading west just before sunset so apparently they decided to leave. Thus ended a brief J pod foray into the Salish Sea in early May 2017. It is very apparent that the whales go and spend their time where they find salmon, and they have a strategy and group coordination for their search. All of J pod and L87 appeared to be in good condition during this visit, or at least none appeared to be in poor condition. Soon we hope that they will come in more regularly and stay longer, and eventually K and L pods will come in, too.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2017encounters/34

After waiting for the whales to get a little closer, Giles and Dave headed down to Snug Harbor and left at 1145. We found our first whales about a half mile east of Trial Island at 1225. This was J35 along with J47 and J45. J17, J44, and J53 were a little behind the others and quickly caught up and the whales all traveled east in a loose group before turning north once they past Seabird Point. There were other whales well on their way across Haro Strait heading toward the west side of San Juan Island so we moved ahead and briefly saw J40 and J27 spread out heading northeast toward False Bay. Since the leaders had already hit the west side, we decided to move up toward Bellevue Point and let the leaders come to us.

J19 was in the lead and she headed north by herself after milling briefly off Bellevue Point. J41 and J51 were in a loose pair several hundred yards behind J19 and they too continued north. J39 was behind them and he chased a fish off Smallpox Bay before continuing north. J17, J53, and one or two other whales were farther inshore toward the county park. A ways behind these whales were J27 and J31 traveling in a tight pair as they passed CWR although J31 soon broke off and began heading closer to shore toward a couple of other whales who were tight along the shoreline.

We waited in Mitchell Bay for about a half hour before the next group arrived. This was all the J16s plus J40 and they were traveling slowly in a tight group. We left them off the south end of Kellett Bluff at 1515 and they began spread out after we left. Another half mile behind the J16s was another group that included L87, J38, and J45 who were socializing with one another. As this threesome made it to the south tip of Kellett Bluff, a few other whales could be seen around the corner at the west end of the mouth of Open Bay. One of these whales was J49 and he joined in the fun with L87, J38, and J45. A threesome of females formed ahead of the boys and this was J22, J37, and J40 traveling north together in a tight group.

The L87 group were the trailing whales so, since the only whale we had not seen at that point was J46, we decided to head north toward the leading groups to see if we could find her. There were two groups paralleling each other mid-strait off Spieden Island. We headed to the slightly more westerly group which included J27, J31, J35, and also J46! They were traveling slowly in a tight group. A couple of hundred yards to the east was a looser group that looked to be the rest of the J17s plus J39. J39 was rolling around with a couple of juveniles who were probably J44 and J47. We left these groups a little after 1600 and headed back to take one more look at the J16s who were back together in a tight, slow moving group.

As we were entering Cowichan Bay at approximately 1105 we saw a slick and smelt a seal kill off Cape Keppel on Saltspring Island so suspected where these animals had been previously. At 1120 we spotted the T124D's and T086A's circling around a seal in Sansum Narrows slightly north of Burial Island. After several minutes of circling around and letting T124D's new calf get a good look at the hunt they got the seal and grouped up as they shared it on their northward travel. Several commerical whale watch boats arrived and we decided to end our encounter at 1234 as they were traveling at a steady 5 knots north bound along the shoreline of Saltspring Island slightly south of Crofton pulp mill.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2017encounters/30

The four whales were the T49As and they were loosely spread out and milling. They had been reported to have made a kill just prior to Dave’s arrival. T49A1 spyhopped twice.
The whales grouped up and headed west into Spring Passage between Jones Island and the southwest tip of Orcas Island. At 1032, the whales began milling and T49A3 made several upside down passes under the boat reconfirming he is still a male. The whales then pointed south and went on a very long dive. The boats present split Jones Island and “Orcinus” went around the south side to see if they showed up there. While it was unclear if a surfacing was missed (Dave thinks not), the whales were not re-sighted for over ten minutes before they finally re-appeared off the southwest side of Jones Island. They briefly freaked out a Steller sea lion but left it unharmed. The T49As then travelled around the west side of Jones Island before spreading out on the northwest side of the island. The whales began milling in that area and apparently made an inconspicuous kill on a harbor seal or porpoise. Other than some brief fin shaking from T49A1, there was no real evidence of a kill until blubber oil was smelled in the air and then some small snotty floating pieces appeared. Even the gulls missed this kill as there were none around to pick up the pieces. Photos later revealed that T49A1 did have something in his mouth when he passed near the boat.
The whales then began travelling slowly northeast up the west shoreline of Orcas Island. Since more boats were arriving on scene, Dave decided to move out and ahead and headed north up President Channel in hopes that other transients might appear to the north. No such luck at the time and it was another half hour before “Orcinus” was within a mile of a whale. By about 1148, T49A1 appeared nearby heading slowly northeast almost a half mile ahead of and inshore of the other three whales. Dave ended the encounter around 1207 with one last pass at T49A, T49A3, and T49A4 as they headed slowly northeast up lower President Channel.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2017encounters/29

Dave was working at home while receiving phone calls throughout the rest of the morning from Jane Cogan and Jeanne Hyde relaying the T11s progress as they headed east past Victoria and Oak Bay. After a 1120 call from Jane reporting that the whales had taken a hoped for left and began heading north up the southeast corner of Vancouver Island. Dave grabbed most of his stuff and made it to Snug Harbor before realizing he forgot his float coat. So, a quick trip home to grab said float coat and back to Snug Harbor before finally leaving Snug aboard “Orcinus” at 1220.

“Orcinus” arrived on scene about three quarters of a mile southeast of Gordon Head at the bottom of Cordova Bay at 1241. T11 and T11A were separated by several hundred meters with T11A being inshore of and slightly ahead of T11 as they traveled north in forage mode. They were both taking very long, long dives of the 7-10 minute variety and coming up for their short dives separately. When he was up from his long dives, T11A was relatively cooperative although a two to three foot southeasterly swell made driving and taking photographs difficult at times. Both whales were not moving very fast or far on their long dives but T11A, at least, seemed to pick up a little speed on his short dives. T11 stalled out briefly around 1312 but she soon picked up speed and angle just slightly more westerly bringing her closer to T11A. She was traveling shallow enough that her fluke prints could be followed although she kept outpacing Dave enough that he gave up after getting not much more than a proof of presence shot of her. The encounter ended about a half mile northwest of Zero Rock at 1325 with the whales looking like they were beginning to join up.

Jane called back about twenty minutes later saying she could see whales at Kellett Bluff so Dave grabbed his gear and headed to Snug Harbor. “Orcinus” left Snug at 1215 and arrived on scene off Sunset Point about five minutes later.

J42 began chasing a fish off Small Pox Bay and then J16 with J50, who were a couple hundred yards further southeast than J42, turned around and came back to join the chase. The three of them continued to chase and mill for the next few minutes before joining up and heading slowly southeast inshore toward Bellevue Point at 1233.

J26 was foraging by himself almost a mile to the west of J16, J42, and J50 when “Orcinus” began observing him at 1250. By this point, it was clear that the J16s were the only residents around. J26 was first pointed southeast down Haro Strait before he turned due south and briefly pointed toward Sea Bird Point. He had turned back southeast by the time Dave left him at 1315. The humpback whale known as “Big Mama” was also in Haro Strait today and had re-appeared a little southeast of Kelp Reef. Since J36 and J52 were being so hard to find, Dave thought he might go take a look at “Big Mama” but Mark Malleson soon pointed him in the direction of J36s, who were back toward Edwards Point on SJI.

“Orcinus” found the J36s inshore right off Edwards Point at 1330. J36 and J52 were foraging separately at first but then they moved a small ways offshore and began chasing a fish together.

They passed Henry Island, headed down Spieden Channel and rounded Green Point, preparing to head towards Stuart Island and then Swanson Channel. A report then came in of whales close by at West Beach, Orcas Island.

Morning Star headed to their last known location through slightly lumpy seas and rain and Johnny spotted them offshore of Freeman Island at about 8:40. It was J pod and they were in two resting groups paralleling each other as they slowly moved north in President Channel. The larger group was made up of the J11s, J14s, J19s, and J22s. The other group was made up of the J16s and they were closer to the Orcas Island shoreline. The J17s and L87 were not located during the encounter.

The two groups then moved away from each other as the J16s continued around Point Doughty, Orcas Island, while the J11s, J14s, J19s, and J22s aimed for Patos Island. Both groups woke up soon after with multiple breaches, belly flops, spy hops, tail slaps, and cartwheels. The J11s, J14s, J19s, and J22s moved further away and eventually disappeared in the choppy seas and rain.

The J16s headed east between Sucia and Orcas Island and eventually, J26 split off from them and aimed for the gap between Patos and Sucia Island. After a while, the rest of the J16s also turned in that direction. The now spread out J11s, J14s, J19s, and J22s re-appeared with some making their way along the Sucia shoreline, while others were further out in the channel. The J16s paralleled the other whales and they soon all passed Parker Reef heading southeast. The seas quickly deteriorated and the encounter was ended at 10:50 as J52 breached, cartwheeled, and tail slapped alongside J36 in sharp 3-5 foot waves and building winds.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2017encounters/26

Dave grabbed his boat gear and headed down to Snug Harbor and left aboard “Orcinus” at 1045. “Orcinus” arrived on scene at 1107, less than a mile south of Point Disney on Waldron Island not far from where they were reported. “J1” had reported that the whales had made a kill or two earlier and they were diving non-directionally and feeding in the same spot when “Orcinus” arrived.

The whales turned out to be the T36s and T46s and soon they all began heading south in a fairly tight group although T46D dropped behind the others by thirty yards or so. One whale was seen carrying meat in her mouth and many gulls were diving to pick up scraps in the whale’s wake. They were pointed southwest on a line that would take them west of Flattop Island and east of Green Point on the east end of Spieden Island for about ten minutes before turning south and passing Flattop Island on the east side by 1130. T46D was now a couple hundred yards to the northwest of the others. The whales continued south toward the O’Neal Island area on the northeast side of San Juan Island. “Orcinus” followed at a distance for the next half hour until the whales spread out in Rocky Bay and began hunting again. T36B1 may have headed down SJ Channel. Most of the whales soon acted like they had a seal pinned on the bottom as they split into groups and alternated their long dives. T46D and T46E were loosely spread from each other and alternated with the others. It was unclear when the kill was made but the whales milled around a half mile or so southeast of O’Neal Island for about fifteen minutes. A little earlier, a couple of boats out of Friday Harbor found a another small group of whales heading north in San Juan Channel on their way to the T36s and T46s. These whales turned out to be the T99s and T36B1 had probably gone down to join them. By 1230, the T99s had joined the others and all the whales become social. Several whales floated around at the surface while young whales rolled around. There were a lot of vocalizations and raspberries being blown above the surface by the logging whales. The whales were pointed south in the same area in an excited group when “Orcinus” ended the encounter 1238. Blubber oil from the whale’s last kill could be smelled in the air upon departure.

The whales were later reported to have headed down San Juan Channel past Friday Harbor and then turned south and passed out Cattle Pass. They were last seen in the MacArthur Bank area.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2017encounters/25

We turned around and headed that way to confirm ID's. Ivan had reported that Jeanne Hyde had spotted another group from Hannah Heights that was further south than his group. We continued towards Middle Bank and then heard that a small group of 3 or 4 individuals were spotted west of Hein Bank, southwest bound. There was a larger group a mile to the south also traveling southwest.

Dave headed down to Snug Harbor and left aboard “Orcinus” at 1530. “Orcinus” arrived on scene in the Wasp Islands area at 1555. Although a second report had the whales milling off Pt. Caution, the initial report was of the whales heading south down SJ Channel so it was a pleasant surprise to find the whales moving back northwest again.

The whales were traveling slowly and spread out in small groups with some singles across San Juan Channel. The first whales “Orcinus” encountered were the J16s minus the J36s and they were in a loose group about mid-channel. There were small groups and individuals both to north and the south of the J16s. The J16s briefly pointed southwest as the whales south of them converged a little. As the J16s moved slowly on, J27 and J31 (who were the southernmost whales) and another pair, J40 and J45, passed by on either side the boat. The J16s had actually dropped back some and, after another brief look at them, “Orcinus” moved on to a pair of whales several hundred yards to the northeast. This was J39 and J46 and they may have been chasing a fish together as there were several tight turns and J46 did a bunch of tail lobs. These two moved toward and joined several other whales several hundred more yards to the northeast. The whales they joined were L87, J35, J47, and J44 and this group seemed to be socializing.

Other whales could be seen to the northwest near Jones Island so “Orcinus” moved on toward them. J38 was traveling west on his own off the south side of Jones Island and a small group of females was seen way up ahead rounding the corner of Jones and heading northwest. A small group of juveniles were either playing or chasing a fish behind J38. This was J49, J51, and J52 and they romped along together and made themselves difficult to photograph. Around 1645, a single female approached out of the west and slowly approached the rambunctious juveniles. This was J36 coming back and J38 turned around and followed her back to the young whales. J36 quickly collected J52 although J49 and J51 continued to goof around. Several spread out females could be seen along a tide rip about a half mile to the northwest so “Orcinus” headed there next. These females conveniently came together into a nice group that included J19, J22, J37, and J41. These were the northernmost whales and they were pointed northwest toward the area between Flattop and Waldron Islands.

After getting photos of the group of four females, “Orcinus” headed back south in an attempt to find J17 and J53 who were the last two J pod whales Dave had not seen yet. The L87 group was about three quarters of a mile or more to the southeast. This was same group L87 was in before and, luckily, J17 and J53 had joined them since they had last been left. This group still seemed quite social and they moved slowly northwest, eventually heading north on the east side of Flattop Island. To the southwest of this group were the J16s minus the J36s again but with J40 and J45. The J16s plus J40 and J45 traveled slowly west together along the south side of Flattop and Gull Islands. When they were just west of Gull Island, the group turned north and began to split up as J26 moved off to the west and J40 and J42 dropped back a little. J31 approached from the southwest and traveled loosely with the now spread out group. J27 finally reappeared about halfway between Gull Island and Green Point. However, he was taking five minute dives and only coming up for one, sometimes two, breaths so he was soon left alone as he turned northeast toward Mouatt Bay on the west side of Waldron Island. The whales that had been northeast of Flattop Island looked like they were mostly in Mouatt Bay too. “Orcinus” ended the encounter after giving up on J27 at 1826 about a mile and a half south of Sandy Point on Waldron Island.

Dave headed down to Snug Harbor and left aboard “Orcinus” at 1210. Just five minutes later, “Orcinus” rounded the south end of Kellett Bluff and saw whales up ahead heading south.
The whales were spread out in singles and small groups and a few single whales including J22 headed south less than a quarter mile from Kellett Bluff. J37 breached a couple of times on her way by. A small group was closer to the bluff and this ended up being J17, J53, J38, and J49. This group of four actively chased a salmon together with J38 making several high speed lunges. Once the fish chase was over, this group split up and the whales continued south. Since it looked like more whales were on the Canadian side, “Orcinus” worked its way west. J35 and J47 were photographed together about mid-strait. To the northwest of them, J41, J51, and J46 were together in a group. The J36s were to the west of this group and more single animals could be seen spread out to the west of Kelp Reef. The J41s and J46 headed southwest toward Sea Bird Point and passed the Kelp Reef marker by less than a hundred yards. There was a pair of bald eagles sitting on the top of the marker and two Steller sea lions hauled out at the base with another in the water. There were a couple of whales foraging just to the west of Kelp Reef although they disappeared before they could be identified.

J27 and L87 were seen traveling together about a half mile to the southwest of Kelp Reef. These two were also moving slowly toward Sea Bird Point.

This threesome was mostly pointed west directly at Baynes Channel as they traveled slowly in the trough. There was some brief social activity and milling between J26 and the J36s before they loosened up some.

Shortly after leaving the harbor they spotted blows a couple of miles south of Clover Pt in the excellent lighting. The first whale encountered was L87 heading toward Trial Island – northeast bound. They then came across J26 and J38 engaged in intimate activity. The whales were very spread out at first and moving slowly against the strong ebb current. There was some foraging in the Oak Bay Flats however there was no evidence that they were catching any fish. Mark and Hanna had the dip net ready with hopes of getting some scales, just in case. The whales started grouping up as they approached Discovery Island and worked their way through the strong tidal chop where Mark and Hanna left them.
Ken came out in “Shachi” from Snug Harbor at 1344 into Haro Strait as the tide was about to slacken and the chop died down. At 1408, he encountered J27 by himself about two miles off Hannah Heights, San Juan Island, heading up Haro Strait. He was diving for 5-6 minutes and then surfacing for a very few blows before diving again, and traveling several hundred unpredictable yards between surfacings. There were already a few whales inshore of him, so Ken left to check them out. Mark and Hanna had already photo-documented most of the whales present, so the priority now was to identify the outliers, check on whale-body condition, and look for foraging events. Three high speed surface chases representing what were surmised to be foraging events were seen in the next hour and a half as the very spread out assemblage of whales traveled slowly north, taking long dives of 5-7 minutes between surfacings. J49 was seen to conduct a prolonged chase in circles several hundred yards off Dead Man’s Bay, but by the time Ken arrived in “Shachi” with a dip net for sampling scales only a few could be seen drifting downward, out of reach of the dip net. The scales appeared to be small, from an estimated six to eight pound fish. Of the ten whales that Ken was able to see, all appeared to be in good body condition, so they must be finding enough to eat.

It happened that Mark had a commercial whale-watch trip scheduled and he located a group of whales (T18s and T19s with T124C) throwing around a Steller sea lion (Eumatopias jubata) near Moresby Island. He notified Ken (immersed in paperwork of reports, permit applications, meeting schedules, and vehicle registrations – all important behind the scenes work) and he deferred until the paperwork was done. By mid-afternoon, after listening to the radio and phone reports of the predation event continuing in much the same area, and additional killer whales moving into the area, the paperwork was put aside and Ken departed Snug Harbor in “Shachi” at 1424, now with 80% fuel indicated after filling up.

They were T18s, T19s, T36s, T46s, T99s, T122, and T124C alternately “porpoising”, traveling, cartwheeling, and exuberantly splashing as they swam along with no obvious reaction to the presence of at least three whale-watch boats and a DFO Fisheries Enforcement RIB. Everybody seemed relaxed except the whales that were in a usual post-predation rambunctious mode.

This was L87 and he was heading south on a bee-line for Sea Bird Point on Discovery Island-passing Kelp Reef by only a couple hundred yards to the east of it. About a quarter mile to the north of L87, J38 was also traveling south by himself on a bee-line for Seabird Point. “Orcinus” left J38 in the Kelp Reef area at about 1150. “Orcinus” then headed back east across the strait toward Bellevue Point and Lime Kiln but could not find any more whales as most of the whales had headed toward Discovery Island on their way back out. The rain was back after stopping for a while and the water conditions were deteriorating so Dave called it quits and headed home at 1215.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2017encounters/2017-16

Since the water was a bit lumpy at the time where the whales were, Dave put himself on standby. Jeanne called back around 1115 to report that the whales were now heading north and the water got nicer the farther up Haro Strait they went.

Dave headed down to Snug Harbor and left aboard “Orcinus” at 1145. With the help of Tom and Jane Cogan looking from shore, Dave found his first whale about a mile west of CWR at 1155. This was J39. As J39 headed north, other whales started appearing but they were very spread out. The next whale seen was K12 and then K37 and K43-all three traveling or foraging by themselves. K22 and K33 were seen next and they were also loosely spread out as they traveled north about a mile or so offshore of mid-Andrews Bay. The pair tightened up a little later. K14 and K26 were seen together inshore of and behind the K22s.

There were a few whales far inshore near San Juan Island but more whales seemed to be appearing to the west of the border so “Orcinus” headed that direction. Passing a few single K12s and K14s again as well as J22 and J38 on the way, the next group “Orcinus” encountered was K20, K38, and K25 traveling together not far from Kelp Reef. A little to the northwest of the K13s was another tight group of three and this was K16, K35, and K21. There was another larger group about a half mile to the northwest and closer to D’Arcy Island. This group had all the J11s, J14s, along with K27, K44, and K34 in it. They were in a tight group heading slowly north-northwest. K26 joined them a little later. The group soon turned due north with a bit more of an angle back across the strait toward Stuart Island.

By about 1620, most of the groups that had been on the Canadian side of the strait moved closer to mid-strait or the Stuart Island side as they approached Turn Point. There were still a few stragglers to the west and to the north of Turn Point. “Orcinus” tried to end the encounter at about 1645 around a mile and a half northwest of Turn Point with the whales still spread out in groups and singles heading toward Swanson Channel. Upon turning the boat around for home, a few more spread out whales could be seen way over on the Canadian side of the strait. A quick picture of a backlit juvenile revealed J47 so that might have been where some of the J17s had been hiding. Since daylight was fading, “Orcinus” headed south toward home. At 1705, between Battleship Rock and Kellett Bluff, Dave spotted a bull who turned out to be J26. J26 cruised slowly north and “Orcinus” left him at 1715 off Battleship.

Jane and Tom Cogan had been out in their boat “Morning Star” and got photos of the J19s and the rest of the J17s. Jeanne Hyde had photographed the rest of the J16s from shore at Lime Kiln earlier which means the only two whales we could not find today were K13 and L87.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2017encounters/2017-15

We headed down to Hannah Heights as we had heard that Jeanne Hyde had received a text from a friend that they were spread out there.

They were headed south and I could see that there were several more closer to Seabird Point and at least 1 bull well to the east also headed south.

At 1100 I came across J16, J50 and 42 offshore of Sooke travelling west. I spent close to an hour observing them and keeping an eye out for more before continuing on to find the rest. Approximately 3 miles ahead and offshore I spotted several others which included J26 and L87. One of the two bulls was quite frisky as I saw him waving his member around.

These whales remained unfound until Jeanne Hyde spotted them from shore in the early afternoon. Jeanne called Dave a little before 1350 to report that she was seeing whales heading north about a mile offshore somewhere north of Beaumont Shoal so Dave mobilized for the boat.

Dave headed to Snug Harbor and left aboard ""Orcinus"" at 1415. The whales were about 3/4s of a mile off Lime Kiln and slowly heading north spread out in small groups. Poor cell phone service kept Dave and Jeanne (who was on shore at Lime Kiln) from communicating even when we could see each other with the naked eye. If any of our calls would have gone through, Dave would have got the message that Jeanne had seen and photographed T77A heading north a couple of miles out in front of the other whales. Dave ended up missing T77A but Jeanne got photos of him from shore to prove he was there.

When ""Orcinus"" arrived on scene off Lime Kiln at 1427, the T101s seemed to be just coming together after being spread apart and perhaps socializing with other whales. The T101s formed a tight slow moving group that alternated between being pointed at Bellevue Point and heading straight up Haro Strait. They were offshore and ahead of the other groups. About a quarter mile behind and inshore of the T101s was a play group of young juveniles that included T36A2, T36A3, T36B2, T99B, and T99D. This group was doing a lot of splashing and rolling. There were also several reverse surfacings and later a juvenile spyhopped with a small piece of meat in its mouth so it was obvious the kids were playing with pieces of whatever their last meal was.

T36A1 was off by him/herself somewhere between the T101s and the play group. There was another large group of females, larger juveniles, and a sprouter about a half mile to the south and inshore of the play group. This was the moms T36, T36A, T36B, and T99 along with T36B1, T99C, and the sprouter ended up being T124C. This group was also moving very slowly north. The play group moved slowly northeast and inshore until they were about halfway between Lime Kiln and Bellevue Pt. where they stalled out still rolling around at the surface. T36A1 joined them. The moms and the others in that group eventually caught up to the juvenile group and they all headed north very slowly in a loose group. The small juveniles continued playing with one another in the middle of the large group.

The T101s stayed in a tight slow moving group traveling north about a 1/2 to 3/4s of a mile to the northwest of the larger group. Dave ended the encounter with the large group still about a half mile southwest of CWR at 16:35.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2017encounters/2017-12

On the way to town I drove along the waterfront to watch them from shore. They went past the golf course and then swung south of Trial. I watched them porpoising for a short while on a line for Constance Bank before I left to get the boat. At 1045 I came across the first whale L87 who appeared to be the furthest north of the group close to the Victor Hotel buoy. The whales were very spread out and doing fairly long dives.

We caught up with the whales a half mile south east of the Zero Rock marker. They turned out to be the T085's. They were grouped up except for T085A who was a half mile to the east of them. They zig zaged their way towards Kelp Reef where he joined them. They then stalked a probable seal for several minutes before killing it. They celebrated for a couple of minutes with a few jumps and tail lobs and upside down swimming as they continued north sharing the prey. They were leaving lots of scraps behind as the gulls were picking up pieces following the whales. We left the whales with Dave Ellifrit who had arrived just before the predation event started.
Dave arrived, aboard “Orcinus”, to the scene of the T85s just starting their seal kill as described above by Mark and Hanna at about 1420. T85C was the breacher and he appears to be another male. After Mark and Hanna left at 1455, the T85s traveled slowly north in a tight group past the east entrance to Hughes Passage. They spread out briefly before coming back together. At about 1530, the whales milled some and gulls began diving on the spot again. The whales had probably been carrying a part of a seal as it did not look like another kill. T85C and T85D dropped back and appeared to feed on a dropped piece of seal while T85, T85A, and T85B took a brief nap.

Dave headed down to Snug Harbor and left aboard ""Orcinus"" around 1130. The first whales encountered were right off Smugglers Cove at 1142. This was J16, J42, and J50 and they were doing some milling as they headed slowly north. J42 was slightly ahead and offshore of J16 and J50 who were tight together. There was a male about three quarters of a mile or more to the west-southwest of this group and Dave headed out to him next. The male was J26 as expected and he was foraging as he moved slowly north. J26 was going on some very long long dives but was staying up for a couple of extra breaths during his short dives. At about 1236, J26 began vigorously chasing a salmon. The chase lasted for about three minutes before J26 continued slowly north about a mile off Kellett Bluff.

Due to the lack of whales being seen, it became apparent that only members of the J16 matriline were here today. ""Orcinus"" headed back inshore toward Battleship Rock in an effort to find the rest of the J16s. Dave saw blows north of the cormorant rookery on Kellett Bluff and headed that way. It was J16, J42, and J50 again and this time J36 and J52 were with them. The five whales were loosely spread out and milled briefly before heading northeast toward Battleship in a group. J36 and J52 soon dropped behind the other three and looked like they were having a small social moment with J52 rolling around at the surface and in front of his mom's nose. J16, J42, and J50 moved on ahead and also seemed to be doing some milling as they were not going anywhere fast.

We immediately recognized them to be the T018’s. They were grouped up and at one point one of the bulls was up side down as the ferry got within a quarter mile. The whales were southwest bound angling towards the Prevost Island side of Swanson Channel. We put the word out and planned on heading up there ourselves on Mike 1 once we were back in Victoria to look for them. A Prince of Whales zodiac, Peregrine and Ken Balcomb on Shachi went looking for the whales before we were able to get off the dock.
We left the dock at 1546 and ran up the Canadian side of Haro Strait to the bottom of Sidney Island where we took our first scan. We decided to run up Cordova Channel as Joe on Jester had run up Sidney Channel. Peregrine had gone from Boundary Pass through Plumper and out Navy Channel and back down Swanson. Ken had gone out through John’s Pass, passed Turn Point and checked out Mandarte Island and Halibut Island area. Joe had gone up where we assumed the T018’s would be (east side of Saltspring Island). With all this effort we decided to stay on the Canadian shoreline and look in the waters around Sidney also without success. With limited daylight we had to make tracks for home. We came back down Sidney Channel still hopeful that we had gone by them as the whales could have easily made it well south of Sidney with the strong ebb current. At 1735 when all hope was lost a killer whale popped up off our bow as we were approaching Ten Mile Point. It turned out to be the T060’s southbound. We watched them predate on likely a seal at 1739. We spent 25 minutes watching them continuing south in the diminishing day light through Oak Bay doing 6 knots with the ebb. We did not see T002B who is usually with the T060’s.",NA,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2017encounters/18

As they were taxiing out of the harbor we gave Gordon Rowles a call to keep a look for the whales from his apartment. He locked on to them and could confirm the whales were in fact east bound at that time. At 1059 they encountered T102 on his own slowly heading east off of Constance Bank. Mark and Hanna spotted more blows to the west and encountered T101, T101B and the T100’s tightly grouped up and accompanied by T60D (where is the rest of his family?). They were doing a steady 7-8 knots. After shadowing them for a bit Mark and Hanna noticed that T102 was now traveling with T101A (his brother). These two male whales were doing 5 knots and they kept a good distance from the rest of the whales that were behind them. No predation events were seen though the two brothers were swimming through bait balls in Oak Bay flats and skulked around for a while. Mark and Hanna left the whales as the T100’s and T101 with T101B had almost caught up to T102 and T101A to form a group off of Discovery Island before heading north in Haro Strait.
Mark and Hanna were with these whales for one and a half hours in the morning under permit aboard “Mike 1” as they traveled from Constance Bank toward Beaumont Shoals. Then, Mark had a whale-watch trip on a POW boat and kept a respectful distance from them between 1400 until 1515 when Ken came out before fueling in “Shachi” for a quick 30 minute to look at these whales just before the weather deteriorated and the boat indicated Zero (Bingo) fuel, meaning there was not enough to get to a fuel dock and it was questionable whether there was enough to get back to Snug Harbor. Upon fueling the next day it seems that at zero fuel indicated in “Shachi” there is still a reserve of about 4 gallons – eight miles at planning speed (27 knots). Nice to know, but too close a call.

She could see one group west of Kelp Reef and there was another group north of Battleship Rock. There was also a report of a lone male heading south in Sidney Channel. The day before, T77A had become entangled in prawn fishing gear near Saltspring Island before being untangled by DFO. Thinking it would be a good idea to check and see if this whale was T77A, Dave decided to head in that direction when he left Snug Harbor around 1150. Unfortunately, the wind was starting to pick up and conditions were starting to get sloppy in some places. The lone male had last been seen heading south off the south end James Island but he could not be re-found. By this time, 2 more groups of transients had been found near the south end of Lopez Island.
Dave headed for the Kelp Reef group, who were now heading north in Sydney Channel, and got on scene around 1215 off the north end of James Island. These whales were the T11s and T100Bs, and they were traveling north fast and angling for Sidney Spit. The T11s and T100Bs went right over to the beach along the northwest side of the spit and slowed down while along it. Then the whales angled northwest and began fast traveling again.

He contacted Rachel and they met Snug Harbor and then left in the boat at 1146. After heading through Johns Pass, we arrived on scene off Skipjack Island where a couple of boats were watching a single whale from a distance that we never saw. We started the encounter there at 1224 but we had to do a little searching before we could find another whale that we were told was a good ways west of the whale that we never saw. We headed north past Skipjack Island and then west towards Monarch Head when an adult male surfaced about a quarter mile to the southwest of us about mid-Boundary Pass. This was J26 and he was cruising southwest towards Turn Point. He was the only whale that was in sight. After getting some shots of J26 we headed back up Boundary Pass towards Monarch Head. Another single male was seen to the north of us but he disappeared. After about ten minutes or so, he surfaced to the south of us. This was J27 and he was also cruising southwest towards Turn Point. As we were finishing up with J27, another whale showed up about a quarter mile to the northwest of us. This was J45 and he too was speeding toward Turn Point. We decided to head that direction in hopes of finding more whales and, after a few minutes, saw a few spread out blows as we got closer to the north side of Stuart Island. J46 was photographed as she sped toward Stuart Island. A few more spread out whales were to the east of her. One of these was J53 and she briefly came together with J42 as they also headed southwest towards Stuart. These whales, along with a few others, soon hit the shoreline on the north side of Stuart Island and headed west towards Turn Point. We went ahead and waited for the whales we could see to round the point. About fifteen minutes later, a loosely spread group of whales came around the corner. This was some of the whales we had been seeing plus a few others including the J22s and J37s. J26 breached twice. J38 did a couple of taillobs and J49, once he was a little south of the bluffs, breached three times in a row. The whales spread out again as they headed south down Haro Strait. We found J22 almost mid-strait off Tiptop Hill on Stuart island with J49 relatively nearby. J37 and J59 could be seen over a quarter of a mile east of these two. Except for a brief glimpse of J53 off the south end of Kellett Bluff, these were the only four whales we had in sight as we traveled south down Haro. The J37s reached Kellett Bluff a little before 1520. They traveled south along the rocks until the south end of the bluff and then turned back northwest. J22 had appeared in the tide rip off the south end of the bluff and, as she started chasing a salmon, the J37s moved in to help. The chase was soon over and the J37s turned back southeast. J59 began breaching repeatedly as they turned east into Mitchell Bay. The J37s soon turned south again and we ended the encounter at 1542 off the mouth of Open Bay.",21238/ DFO SARA 388,https://whaleresearch.wixsite.com/2023encounters/2023-23

The team found spread out whales off San Juan County Park at 11:31, which proved to be J37, J59, J45, and J38. Hoping for some better water for drone flights further down island, the team took distant proof of presence shots of these whales and continued down island, starting the encounter properly at 11:57 on the north side of False Bay.

The J31s were foraging alongside J42, pausing occasionally to socialize in between deep dives. These whales moved north slowly, passing Pile Point and Hannah Heights. The team saw distant fins making their way up island from Eagle Point, so decided to plant themselves at Pile and see who swam by.

The team soon saw J16 and J26, with J27 offshore of them. All three whales were clearly searching and occasionally taking deep prey pursuit dives, but we didn't see any direct evidence of successful predation.

After making their way up to Hannah Heights, these three whales made a turn and headed back down island. Reasoning that this meant the whales further up island would soon be passing Pile Point again, the team once again decided to sit and wait for other whales to filter by.

At 13:49, more fins appeared coming down island. The first three whales (J42, J31, and J56) appeared, now accompanied by J46, J35, and J57. The group split up by age, with the females spreading out to forage while the two youngest whales, J56 and J57, mostly goofed off. However, the two kids did find a couple fish at the surface and attempted to chase them, but one managed to dive out of harms way and another escaped to the shallows.

J42 had more luck, catching a fish at depth before bringing it up to share with J31 and J56. Soon after, the whales switched gears and started heading back up island in a travelling formation.

They arrived on scene at 1513 with a group that they would soon figure out was the T065As (without T065A5, per usual these days) along with T037A1, and T037A3.

The first blow the team saw as they got on scene was not a killer whale, but instead a small humpback whale that was inshore near the killer whales. From a distance, the team saw splashing that may have been either the killer whales harassing the humpback or the humpback becoming agitated. Either way, by the time the team got the drone in the air and over the killer whale group, they had passed up the humpback, while the humpback had gone ""stealth mode"", surfacing rarely and irregularly.

The team followed the whales as they made their way up the shoreline, travelling with occasional bouts of social behavior. The whales would periodically spread out into a couple subgroups, quickly coming back together.

The team conducted a couple drone flights with these whales, getting very clear images of each to add to our aerial catalogue of Bigg's killer whales. The whales briefly paused at the reef in front of the CWR office, before continuing north.

The team landed the drone and decided to try for a photo-ID pass. As they approached the whales off Mitchell Bay, the group began to angle for Mosquito Pass, making it difficult to get on the correct side for lighting. The whales became social as they neared the mouth of the pass, breaking into a few pairs and trios.

After a quick pass to get proof of presence shots, the team made the call to not follow the whales into the narrow, heavily trafficked pass. They ended the encounter at 1605 and quickly got back to Snug to end the day.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-60

The first two whales they team encountered were J44 and J38, both foraging but separated by a few hundred yards. The team launched the drone and watched the two of them forage. J38 was clearly pursuing fish under the surface, but too deep to see with the drone. J44, however, chased a large salmon at the surface and successfully caught it. We eventually also saw J38 with fish parts in his mouth, so we know he was at least somewhat successful in his hunts.

These two whales were soon joined by J44's younger sister, J53, who joined in the foraging. She was eventually successful in catching a fish, which she promptly shared half of with J44. After sharing food, the two siblings took some time to socialize before returning to foraging.

After a few flights with these whales, the team moved on to a group they had spotted further down island. They found the J37s travelling with the J31s and J40, split into two groups. These whales mostly socialized as they moved down island and offshore.

The team then headed inshore, finding another group of whales: J46, J42, and J35. These whales were also busy socializing. J35 split off from the other two females to join her two sons, J57 and J47. J47 approached the other two with a fish already in his mouth. However, the fish was still alive, and he released it, seemingly on purpose. He, his younger brother, and his mom then started chasing the dazed fish. J47 actually grabbed it again, once again letting it go. The fish got some distance and tried to dive, but J35 followed and finally caught it for good. She broke the fish up, sharing with her two sons.

The J35s met back up with J42 and J46, and started kelping and socializing. The team stayed with them until 14:13 before batteries began to wear down and they had to end the encounter.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-75
