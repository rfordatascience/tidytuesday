  "pic2_alt": "Average wins of each seed: auto versus at-large. The plot displays the average wins of seeds by bid type. Auto bids are teams that are guaranteed a spot in the tournament from winning their conference tournament and At-Large bids are teams that do not win their conference tournament but are considered good enough to make the tournament. The overall trend is that teams that are Auto bids have higher average wins than At-Large bids. Outliers are the 6, 7 and 13 seeds, but that is due to a very low sample size of At-Large bids for them. The 11 and 12 seeds do not follow the same trend, likely because the worst At-Large teams are better teams than the Auto teams in the advanced metrics."
