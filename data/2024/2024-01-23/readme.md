# Educational attainment of young people in English towns

The [dataset](https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/educationandchildcare/datasets/educationalattainmentofyoungpeopleinenglishtownsdata/200708201819/youngpeoplesattainmentintownsreferencetable1.xlsx) this week comes from [The UK Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/).
It was explored in the July 2023 article ["Why do children and young people in smaller towns do better academically than those in larger towns?"](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/educationandchildcare/articles/whydochildrenandyoungpeopleinsmallertownsdobetteracademicallythanthoseinlargertowns/2023-07-25).
Thank you [Andrea Carpignani](https://github.com/acarpignani) for the dataset suggestion.

The article this week contains several plots, one of which is interactive. Can you reproduce them? Can you find anything in the data that isn't explored in the article?

## The Data

```{r}
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-01-23')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 4)

english_education <- tuesdata$english_education

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

english_education <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-01-23/english_education.csv')
```

## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
