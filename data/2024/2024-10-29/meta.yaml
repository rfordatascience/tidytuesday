    A poster for Mighty Mighty Monsters Halloween Havoc. A werewolf,
    Frankenstein's monster, and a vampire are standing in front of a school.
    They all appear to be children or teenagers. Frankenstein's monster has a
    trophy with a carved Jack-o-lantern. The werewolf's arms are full of candied
    apples, and he has a candied apple in his mouth. The monsters appear to be 
    running away from the school. The tagline is Too Ghoul for School!
