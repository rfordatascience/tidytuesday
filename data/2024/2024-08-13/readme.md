# World's Fairs

We're in Seattle this week for [posit::conf](https://posit.co/conference/), so we're exploring [World's Fairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_fair)! 

> A world's fair, also known as a universal exhibition or an expo, is a large global exhibition designed to showcase the achievements of nations. These exhibitions vary in character and are held in different parts of the world at a specific site for a period of time, typically between three and six months.

The data was scraped from [Wikipedia's list of world expositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_expositions).

Does the length of a Fair depend on the month in which the fair begins?
How has the cost per month changed over time?
How about the cost per visitor?

## The Data

```r
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-08-13')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 33)

worlds_fairs <- tuesdata$worlds_fairs

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

worlds_fairs <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-08-13/worlds_fairs.csv')
```

## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
