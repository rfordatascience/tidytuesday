Brevard Mayor Maureen Copelof says “Pisgah Penny has established herself as a beloved and valued member of this community who openly asserts her love for Brevard,” while “Punxsutawney Phil has established himself as, let’s be honest, an ill tempered, unreliable predictor.”",https://groundhog-day.com/images/ghogs/pisgah-penny.jpeg,2
