# Campus Pride Index

Happy Pride Month! 
Check out the [{gglgbtq}](https://github.com/turtletopia/gglgbtq) package for LGBTQ-related themes and color palettes!

The data this week comes from the [Campus Pride Index](https://campusprideindex.org/).

> Since 2007, the Campus Pride Index has been the premier LGBTQ national benchmarking tool for colleges and universities to create safer, more inclusive campus communities. The free online tool allows prospective students, families/parents and those interested in higher education to search a database of LGBTQ-friendly campuses who have come out to improve the academic experience and quality of campus life.

The website has additional information about each campus, including a more detailed breakdown of their Campus Pride Index rating.

Is there a relationship between the size of a campus or the surrounding community and its rating? 
What about the state in which the campus is located?

## The Data

```{r}
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-06-11')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 24)

pride_index <- tuesdata$pride_index
pride_index_tags <- tuesdata$pride_index_tags

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

pride_index <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2024/2024-06-11/pride_index.csv')
pride_index_tags <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2024/2024-06-11/pride_index_tags.csv')
```

## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
