Initially, the main thrust of RHD’s support of these start-ups was in the provision of fiscal sponsorship, and other assistance was provided through informal consultation and technical support by senior RHD staff. By 1980, RHD found itself working with more than a dozen small organizations and facing an increasing demand for assistance as word had spread through the nonprofit community about the corporation’s willingness to support fledgling organizations. In response to this need, RHD formalized its services to form the Incubator in 1981.
