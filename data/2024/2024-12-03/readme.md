# National Highways Traffic Flow

This week we're exploring National Highways Traffic Flow data! National Highways operates and maintains motorways and major A roads in England. They directly monitor the speed and flow of roads using on road sensors, and the data can be accessed via the [National Highways API](https://webtris.nationalhighways.co.uk/api/swagger/ui/index).

This week's data has vehicle size and speed information for May 2021 from four different road sensors on the A64 road. 

* Do vehicles travel faster on certain days or at certain times?
* What time of day do large vehicles use this road?
* Do smaller vehicles travel faster?

Thank you to [Nicola Rennie](https://github.com/nrennie) for curating this week's dataset.

## The Data

```r
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-12-03')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 49)

A64_traffic <- tuesdata$A64_traffic

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

A64_traffic <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-12-03/A64_traffic.csv')
```

## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
- [Submit your own dataset!](../../../.github/pr_instructions.md)
