    Boxplots of the monthly volume of airline passengers by the duration of
    holidays across the world. (a) Airline passenger statistics in 90
    countries/territories/areas, collated by this study from openly available
    data sources. (b) International air travel data based on passenger bookings,
    obtained from the Official Aviation Guide. The monthly volume of air travel
    was transformed as the rank. Months with higher volumes of airline
    passengers have a higher rank (from the lowest to the highest: 1–12) in each
    year and country. Source: Lai, S., Sorichetta, A., Steele, J. et al. Global
