# Global Holidays and Travel

This week we're exploring how global holidays impact seasonal human mobility. We found the data via the article ["Global holiday datasets for understanding seasonal human mobility and population dynamics" by Shengjie Lai (et al)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01120-z) (thank you to @lgibson7 for finding the dataset).

> Public and school holidays have important impacts on population mobility and dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales, subsequently affecting the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and many socioeconomic activities. However, worldwide data on public and school holidays for understanding their changes across regions and years have not been assembled into a single, open-source and multitemporal dataset. To address this gap, an open access archive of data on public and school holidays in 2010â€“2019 across the globe at daily, weekly, and monthly timescales was constructed. Airline passenger volumes across 90 countries from 2010 to 2018 were also assembled to illustrate the usage of the holiday data for understanding the changing spatiotemporal patterns of population movements.

The source article contains a number of data visualizations. 

- Can you reproduce them? 
- Can you find better ways to show the same information?

Thank you to [Jon Harmon](https://github.com/jonthegeek) for curating this week's dataset.

## The Data

```r
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-12-24')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 52)

global_holidays <- tuesdata$global_holidays
monthly_passengers <- tuesdata$monthly_passengers

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

global_holidays <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2024/2024-12-24/global_holidays.csv')
monthly_passengers <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2024/2024-12-24/monthly_passengers.csv')
```

## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
- [Submit your own dataset!](../../../.github/pr_instructions.md)
