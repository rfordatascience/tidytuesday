# U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Encounter Data

This week we're exploring [U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) encounter data](https://www.cbp.gov/document/stats/nationwide-encounters):

> Encounter data includes U.S. Border Patrol Title 8 apprehensions, Office of Field Operations Title 8 inadmissibles, and all Title 42 expulsions for fiscal years 2020 to date. Data is available for the Northern Land Border, Southwest Land Border, and Nationwide (i.e., air, land, and sea modes of transportation) encounters. Data is extracted from live CBP systems and data sources. Statistical information is subject to change due to corrections, systems changes, change in data definition, additional information, or encounters pending final review. Final statistics are available at the conclusion of each fiscal year.

Thank you to [Tony Galv√°n](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-raul-galvan/) for curating this dataset and providing a [blog post](https://gdatascience.github.io/us_border_patrol_encounters/us_border_patrol_encounters.html) that explores the data in more detail.

-   How has the implementation (and potential end) of Title 42 affected migration and enforcement trends compared to Title 8 actions?
-   What are the key differences in migration patterns and enforcement activity between the Northern and Southwest Land Borders?
-   Are there seasonal or year-over-year trends in encounters that can help predict future migration patterns?

## The Data

```r
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-11-26')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 48)

cbp_resp <- tuesdata$cbp_resp
cbp_state <- tuesdata$cbp_state

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

cbp_resp <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-11-26/cbp_resp.csv')
cbp_state <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-11-26/cbp_state.csv')
```

## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
- [Submit your own dataset!](../../../.github/pr_instructions.md)
