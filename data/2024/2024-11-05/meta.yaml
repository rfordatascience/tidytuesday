    A map from Our World in Data of Political regime, 2023. Based on the 
    classification by Episodes of Regime Transformation and the estimates by
    V-Dem's experts. Countries are filled with red (hardening autocracy), 
    orange (stable autocracy), pale orange (liberalizing autocracy), 
    light blue (eroding democracy), sky blue (stable democracy), or dark blue 
    (deepending democracy). The Americas and Europe are mostly blue in this 
    2023 map.
