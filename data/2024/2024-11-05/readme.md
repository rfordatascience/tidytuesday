# Democracy and Dictatorship

It's Election Day in the United States. If you are able to do so, vote!

To celebrate, we're looking at a dataset about Democracy and Dictatorship.

> This dataset updates [pacl](https://xmarquez.github.io/democracyData/reference/pacl.html) 
> with more countries and coverage from 1950 to 2020, as described in C. 
> Bj√∏rnskov and M. Rode. "Regime types and regime change: A new dataset on 
< democracy, coups, and political institutions". In: *The Review of International Organizations*
> 15.2 (2020), pp. 531-551. [DOI: 10.1007/s11558-019-09345-1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11558-019-09345-1).

- How many countries switched from democracies to non-democracies? Did any of them keep their democratically elected leader after the switch?
- Which of those countries switched back to democracies? How long did it take?

Thank you to [Jon Harmon](https://github.com/jonthegeek) for curating this week's dataset.

## The Data

```r
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-11-05')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 45)

democracy_data <- tuesdata$democracy_data

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

democracy_data <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2024/2024-11-05/democracy_data.csv')
```

## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
- [Submit your own dataset!](../../../.github/pr_instructions.md)
