# The Scent of Data - Exploring the Parfumo Fragrance Dataset

This week we're diving into the fascinating world of fragrances with a dataset sourced from [Parfumo](https://www.parfumo.com/), a vibrant community of perfume enthusiasts.  [Olga G.](https://www.kaggle.com/olgagmiufana1) webscraped these data from the various fragrance sections on the Parfumo website. Here is a description from the author:

> This dataset contains detailed information about perfumes sourced from Parfumo, obtained through web scraping. It includes data on perfume ratings, olfactory notes (top, middle, and base notes), perfumers, year of release and other relevant characteristics of the perfumes listed on the Parfumo website.

> The data provides a comprehensive look at how various perfumes are rated, which families of scents they belong to, and detailed breakdowns of the key olfactory components that define their overall profile

Weâ€™ll explore how perfumes are rated, uncover the scent families they belong to, and delve into the minds of the perfumers behind them. From the year of release to the delicate composition of each scent, this dataset offers a rich olfactory experience for anyone curious about the magic behind their favorite perfumes.

Join us as we decode the stories within these perfumes, from the top notes that hit you first to the lasting base notes that linger in the air. Whether you're a fragrance aficionado or just curious about the data behind the scents, this exploration will open your eyes (and nose) to the artistry of perfume crafting. Ready to sniff out some data?

* What factors most influence the rating of a perfume?
* Are there distinct scent families that dominate the market, and how are they perceived by users?
* Has the popularity of certain fragrance notes evolved over time?

Thank you to [Nicolas Foss, Ed.D., MS | Bureau of Emergency Medical and Trauma Services > Iowa HHS](https://github.com/nicolasfoss) for curating this week's dataset.

## The Data

```r
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-12-10')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 50)

parfumo_data_clean <- tuesdata$parfumo_data_clean

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

parfumo_data_clean <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-12-10/parfumo_data_clean.csv')
```

## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
- [Submit your own dataset!](../../../.github/pr_instructions.md)

# Problems with the Data!

# Some of the columns utilize "N/A" instead of a missing value
# deal with these values efficiently using {tidyselect} and {dplyr}
# additionally, the perfume names include the brand and sometimes the year
# along with a perfume number
# clean the perfume names so we have only the names as there are separate
# variables for the brand and release year
# use the perfume number as an additional column
# there are some numeric columns that are encoded as character due to the "N/A"
# values, we will deal with those
# variables that could be numeric are encoded as strings due to the use of "N/A"
# versus a true missing
# fix!
