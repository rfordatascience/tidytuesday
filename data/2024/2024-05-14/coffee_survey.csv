It was still bitter as it was cooling, but then seemed to hit a point abruptly when the bitterness seemed to subside.

As I would return to this cup, it may have had an unfair uphill battle as I would think to myself “oh, this was the bitter one. Yep, still bitter”.

 I had thought it was my least favorite of the four, but towards the end of the stream (but before the coffees were revealed) as I compared it to Coffee C, the two seemed to almost switch places on me. C became what my initial impression of B was, and B became what my initial impression of C was.
