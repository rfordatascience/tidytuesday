    The cover of the Dungeons and Dragons Free Rules from the website
    dndbeyond.com. The tagline at the top calls D&D the World's greatest
    roleplaying game. The image shows a wizard with white hair and a red robe
    casting a spell, with a pair of sword-wielding allies nearby. They're
    battling a wyvern, a dragon-like creature with a scorpion's tail.

    A bar plot of D&D Spell Power. Number of spells available at each level for
    each class. Spells are counted by level, from cantrip, which is level 0, and
    then 1 through 9. Columns are grouped by class, with paladin having the
    fewest total spells available, and wizards having the most. Wizards have the
    most spells available at every level except for cantrips, where they're
    barely edged out by sorcerers. Only warlocks, clerics, druics, bard,
    sorcerors, and wizards have spells above level 5. Paladins and Rangers only
    have spells at levels 1 through 5.
