# Shiny Packages 

It's time for [ShinyConf2024](https://www.shinyconf.com)!

> ShinyConf is more than just an event; it's a global gathering of diverse Shiny community, creating a shared space for learning, networking, and collaborative exploration. Connect with like-minded enthusiasts from all corners of the world!

Your TidyTuesday maintainers -- [Tracy Teal](https://www.shinyconf.com/keynote-speakers#tracy) and [Jon Harmon](https://www.shinyconf.com/speakers-list#:~:text=Jon-,Harmon,-Executive%20Director%2C%20DSLC) -- are both speaking at ShinyConf on Thursday, 2024-04-18.
We look forward to seeing you there!

What is the most popular way in which packages are connected to Shiny?
Can you create a Shiny app to explore this data?


## The Data

```{r}
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-04-16')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 16)

shiny_revdeps <- tuesdata$shiny_revdeps
package_details <- tuesdata$package_details

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

shiny_revdeps <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2024/2024-04-16/shiny_revdeps.csv')
package_details <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2024/2024-04-16/package_details.csv')

```

## How to Participate

- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](../../../sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
