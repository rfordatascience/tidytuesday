2022,1,Femr: Finite Element Method for Solving PDEs in R,20000,Laura Sangalli,"Femr: There is a need for implementing finite element methods (FEM) in R to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). PDEs are crucial mathematical tools used for modeling complex phenomena in various scientific and engineering fields. However, the absence of FEM implementations in R necessitates the reliance on external software, discouraging the statistical community from developing methods involving PDEs and hindering the learning of this essential mathematical tool. The goal of the project is to develop the femR package, which will provide a finite element basis for solving second-order linear elliptic PDEs on general two-dimensional spatial domains in R.
This package will complement the existing deSolve package and enable users to employ finite elements instead of finite differences for solving PDEs on more diverse spatial domains.

2022,1,Continuing to Improve R’s Ability to Visualise and Explore Missing Values,5000,Nicholas Tierney,"The proposal for “Continuing to Improve R’s Ability to Visualise and Explore Missing Values” addresses missing values in data analysis. Missing values are often dropped by default in data analysis in various stages. There is often not even a warning displayed to alert the user of missing values being dropped or discarded. This means values can be dropped without the user knowing, leading to issues such as potential bias, where missing values might be occurring in high numbers in particular groups.

2021,2,Data Science and Machine Learning Training Workshop Using R Programming Language,5200,Timothy A. Ogunleye,"We want to conduct training workshops on data science and machine learning with R. Out of nearly 60 countries that form the continent, we carefully selected four countries – one from each of the North, South, West, and East Africa. Nigeria is considered for the West Africa, Kenya is chosen from the East Africa, Sudan from the North Africa, while Zimbabwe is selected from the South African countries. We have 2 volunteers each, who are experts in the field of data science and machine learning with R, from the selected countries. We have also recruited 2 tutors for each country, making a total of 8. These tutors would serve as training assistants to the coordinators. Training materials are to be prepared by the coordinators. Therefore, the coordinators are expected to teach the contents of the training materials.",NA
2021,1,Accounting/Auditing Gap-Analysis,7000,Felix Schildorfer,"There are more and more accountants and auditors who want to start using R and dig into data science. They usually have particular tasks on hand that they want to complete, facilitate, or automate. While they often have some basic stats skills and may be some coding basics, understanding the R landscape and relating tasks and processes to locate and use relevant R packages and tutorials is an extreme challenge. While other areas like finance or pharmaceuticals already have extensive infrastructure to support R newcomers (Working Groups, Courses, Task Views, etc.) accounting and auditing do not. This becomes an obstacle for such professionals - which find the “coding” part difficult on their own but doing so without any support or knowing the appropriate package becomes a nightmare.
This is why R Business put together this project with the aim to gauge the landscape of what functionalities are available for Auditors in the R ecosystem and how the existing functionalities can be mapped to routine accounting/auditing tasks. We will complete a systematic survey of the CRAN-ecosystem for accounting/auditing tasks to establish a mapping and identify gaps. The project will contribute to the development of the R Business ISC working group by attracting interested accounting/auditing professionals, industry bodies and R community members. This will then in turn lead to increased use of R/RStudio, development new application domains for data science, and enhancement of the quality of accounting/auditing services.",NA

2021,1,Google Earth Engine with R,5500,Cesar Luis Aybar Camacho,"Google Earth Engine (GEE) is the most popular and advanced cloud platform designed for planetary-scale environmental data analysis. Its multi-petabyte data catalog and computation services are just accessed via Python and JavaScript client libraries. In order to facilitate its use within R, six months ago, rgee was released on CRAN using reticulate to wrap the GEE Python API. Although rgee provides a familiar interface and simple integration to other R packages (e.g., sf, raster, dplyr), the lack of tutorials and examples makes it difficult for new users to adopt.
The main goal of this project is to leverage the documentation. For this purpose, three main tasks have been proposed: (1) create a new version of rgee with support for shiny and markdown, (2) create rgeeExtra, which extends the functionalities of rgee, and finally write (3) rgeebook, a reference book with best practices and examples of GEE API usage.",NA
2021,1,Improving Translations in R,0,Michael Chirico,"This project will provide a better formalization of translation procedures for R to be more sustainable and more scalable.

2021,1,Minimizing wastage of blood products,11200,Balasubramanian Narasimhan,"Guan et al. 2017 (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 114 (43): 11368–73) used two years worth of data to formulate and solve an optimization problem to predict platelet usage and minimize waste. Two open-source R packages were developed for this purpose:
- Platelet Inventory Prediction or pip (https://github.com/bnaras/pip) a package that is the core ML prediction engine that uses a given set of features described in the above publication
- Stanford Blood Center Platelet Inventory Prediction or SBCpip (https://github.com/bnaras/SBCpip) that was customized to the data workflow at SHC. SBCpip was meant to be site specific.

2021,1,Setting up an R-Girls-Schools Network,5000,Dr. Razia Ghani,"Globally, women, especially from deprived socio-economic and diverse ethnic backgrounds, are under-represented in data science. A major factor is that data science does not feature in the school curriculum which means that teachers are unaware of the enhancements data science can bring to learning and development in and beyond the school. We propose an ongoing project, called R-Girls-School Network (short name R-Girls) to address this and are keen to link up with others.
We are a multi-disciplinary team that includes an educationalist, subject teachers, a data scientist and administrator who will begin to develop and implement a data science curriculum using R in Green Oak Academy – an inner-city school in the UK serving girls from deprived, ethnically diverse backgrounds aged 11-16 years; independently rated as Good with Outstanding for Behaviour and Attitudes.
Since GOA follows the UK national curriculum, which is used in 10,000+ schools and 160 countries, our work will have a broad appeal. In due course we will develop ready-to-use bite-sized learning materials (10-15 mins) for teachers of core subjects (maths, statistics, science, geography) to use via RStudio cloud. The lessons will be tested with teachers and pupils and then incorporated into the school timetable across all five-year groups (age 11-16 years), culminating in an R-Data Story project and in due course, an annual R-Girls virtual conference open to any girl and girls' school in the world.
R-GS will be supported by a website for showcasing the work of pupils and sharing resources.",NA
2021,1,deposits: Deposit Research Data Anywhere,16000,Mark Padgham,"Publicly depositing datasets associated with published research is becoming more common, partly due to journals increasingly requiring data sharing, and partly though more general and ongoing cultural changes in relation to data sharing. Yet data sharing is often seen as time consuming, particularly in order to meet the expectations of individual data repositories. While documentation and training can help get users familiar with processes of data sharing, browser-based data and metadata submission workflows can only be so fast, are not easily reproduced, and do not facilitate regular or automated updates of data and metadata. Better programmatic tools can transform data sharing from a mountainous climb into a pit of success.
This project will develop a unified interface to many different research data repositories, and which will function along the lines of dplyr through ""verbs"" that work identically across many ""backend"" data repositories. The package will initially provide access to a few of the most common data repositories, yet will implement a modular/plugin system to enable users to contribute their own plugins to extend functionality to other repositories. Users will be able to authenticate, prepare data and metadata, and finally to submit, fetch, and browse data.",NA
2020,2,Development and maintenance of the Windows build infrastructure (Top level project proposal),46800,Jeroen Ooms,"As of R 4.0.0 (released April 2020), R for Windows uses a brand new toolchain bundle called rtools40. This version upgrades the mingw-gcc toolchains to version 8.3.0, and introduces a powerful new build system based on the widely used msys2 platform, which makes it easier to maintain R itself, as well as system libraries needed for developing R and R-packages.
The current project seeks to build out this system to improve tooling for building and debugging on Windows, and move towards a scalable build infrastructure, which is transparent, extensible, and fully automated. Thereby we can empower development on Windows, and support further growth of the R ecosystem while relieving work for CRAN and R-core members.",NA

By implementing an R-to-JavaScript transpiler, i.e. a program that translates R code into JavaScript code, it lets R users develop JavaScript(JS) applications using solely the R syntax. This eliminates the need to pick up an entire new language, makes it easy for R users to learn and experiment with JS technologies and gives direct and full access to all existing JS libraries. The transpiler is distributed as a regular R package, and it can be used standalone or to complement existing packages, including Rmarkdown, shiny and V8.",https://github.com/kcf-jackson/sketch and https://cran.r-project.org/package=sketch
2020,1,Consolidating R-Ladies Global organisational guidance and wisdom,4000,Maëlle Salmon,"R-Ladies Global is a successful, growing organization aiming at increasing gender diversity in the R community. R-Ladies Global is a Top-Level Project of the ISC. R-Ladies Global guidance for starting and running a chapter, as well as overseeing chapters around the world, and for the rotating curator account, grew organically. The information is fragmented and exists in different formats: several Markdown and PDF Documents and wiki entries in a GitHub repository. This impedes the optimal finding of resources by those who need them, and also impedes contributions. This project aims to consolidate existing R-Ladies Global guidance into a well-structured and continuously deployed online book, with its source open on GitHub, as ( R ) Markdown documents woven together, and whose maintenance will be an R-Ladies major priority task.
The project will create a web based manuscript containing all the necessary information to understand what the R-Ladies organization is about, its structure and how to contribute to its mission. Information will be collated and organized leveraging the experience of R-Ladies organizers and volunteers that, over the past 4 years, contributed to the establishment and growth of one of the most active and successful communities in the data science realm.

2020,1,Database interoperability for spatial objects in R,6000,Etienne Racine,"Manipulating spatial data in R sometimes requires interaction with a spatial database: the data doesn't fit in memory, or simply because this is where the data is. The `sf` package already supports the PostGIS spatial database, but this project will extend the compatibility and make it easier to integrate in the `dplyr` workflow (with `dbplyr`). We also want to make it easier to add support for new database backends. We'll create a new `sfdbi` package to centralize the interface between `sf` and databases and remove dependencies in `sf`. If you want to contribute, or if you'd like to suggest a database, make sure to join the `sfdbi` repo.",https://github.com/r-spatial/sfdbi
2020,1,HTTP testing in R Book,16000,Maëlle Salmon,"More and more R packages access resources on the web, and play crucial roles in workflows: data access and updates for CRM reports (Hubspot APIs), for scientific publications (scientific web APIs, Open Science Framework). Like for all other packages, appropriate unit testing can make them more robust. Their unit testing brings special challenges: dependence of tests on a good internet connection, testing in the absence of authentication secrets, etc. Having tests fail due to resources being down or slow, during development or on CRAN, means a time loss for everyone involved (slower development, messages from CRAN). Although many packages accessing remote resources are well tested, there is a lack of resources around best practices for HTTP testing in packages using httr, crul, or curl. The best guidance to date about HTTP testing for R packages to our knowledge is a forum entry that pre-dates the development of relatively new packages for HTTP testing that have now been released on CRAN: vcr and webmockr by Scott Chamberlain, httptest by Neal Richardson, presser by Gábor Csárdi. This project aims at curating a free, central reference for developers of R packages accessing web resources, to help them have a faster and more robust development. We shall develop an useful guidance, in the form of a open-source web-based book.",https://github.com/ropensci-books/http-testing

2020,1,Spatiotemporal Data and Analytics,10000,Benedikt Gräler,"Many data sets are recorded irregular in space and time. Movement of people driving the spread of an disease, or the distribution of current and future cases are per se irregular spatiotemporal data and only two of many examples. Being able to easily visualise, aggregate and model irregular spatiotemporal data will help to better understand and forecast underlying processes. Filling the gap for irregular spatiotemporal data and providing direct interaction with analytical tools will ease the analysis for researchers. We will develop the sftime package to a mature state so that the suite of modern spatial and spatiotemporal data representations in R includes irregular spatiotemporal data. After doing this, we will modify the geostatistical modelling package gstat and the spatial copula modelling package spcopula to support the new data representation classes of sf, stars and sftime.",https://github.com/BenGraeler/STDataAndAnalytics/

In response to the large diversity of ad-hoc solutions, in part outdated, we propose a generic and flexible approach that support all stages of movement studies (pre-processing, post-processing and analysis). 'sftrack' provides two central classes for tracking data (points) and movement data (steps), and basic functions to build, handle, summarize and plot them. Version 1.0 of 'sftrack' will be finalized and submitted to CRAN, and will already incorporate converters from/to classes of major existing tracking packages. We will further work with all tracking package developers willing to fully integrate the solution offered by 'sftrack' into their package data flow.",https://github.com/mablab/sftrack
2019,2,An External R Sampling Profiler,8500,Aaron Jacobs,"Many R users will be familiar with using the built-in sampling profiler 'Rprof()' to generate data on what their code is doing, and there are several excellent tools to facilitate understanding these samples (or serve as a front-end), including the 'profvis' package. However, the reach of these tools is limited: the profiler is “internal”, in the sense that it must be manually switched on to work, either during interactive work (for example, to profile an individual function), or perhaps by modifying the script to include 'Rprof()' calls before running it again. It cannot be used to understand R code that is already running, a capability that has proven extremely useful for diagnosing and fixing performance issues (or other bugs) in production environments.
Several existing programming languages have one or more “external” profilers available, which can attach to a running process and read its memory contents to understand what is currently happening. This project aims to build such a tool for R.",https://github.com/atheriel/xrprof

There are a number of R packages such as optimx, nloptr, ROI which either implement solvers for a wide variety of problems, or provide an interface to other solvers. The R package CVXR takes a different approach, implementing a Domain Specific Language (Fu, Narasimhan, and Boyd 2019) for formulating and solving convex optimization problems, just as cvxpy does for python. As shown in a number of examples on the CVXR website, the applications range from finance, machine learning, and to theoretical and applied statistics. Using a disciplined convex programming (DCP) approach, CVXR acts as a great tool for both prototyping and developing new methodologies as well as for quick, high-level, formulation and solution of statistical and machine learning problems.",https://github.com/cvxgrp/CVXR
2019,2,Flipbooks,6699,Evangeline Reynolds,"Just as classic flip books allow their readers to observe changes in a scene, coding Flipbooks allow readers to progressively track the changes of code and its output by “flipping” through their digital pages. Flipbooks are useful tools for communicating and teaching because they break down code for incremental, stepwise presentation so that audiences can easily understand each step. Flipbook-building tools automate the deconstruction and reconstruction of coding pipelines which means that building a Flipbook from existing code poses little additional burden to creators.

2019,2,"RcppDeepState, a simple way to fuzz test compiled code in R packages",34000,Toby Hocking,"Abstract: Fuzzers are computer programs that send other programs inputs that may fall outside the domain of expected values, thus revealing subtle bugs. DeepState is a testing framework that allows easy testing of C/C++ programs with sophisticated fuzzers, and supports multiple back-ends for testing. DeepState has been used to test critical C++ software, including Google's leveldb. R has some simple random testers, but no coverage-driven fuzzers that learn to produce problematic inputs. We propose to create the R packages RcppDeepState and RcppDeepStateTools which will provide easy-to-use functions for using DeepState with R packages that use C/C++ code via Rcpp. This project will thus provide the first easy-to-use solution for R programmers that want to fuzz test their C/C++ code with existing tools such as AFL, and it will provide a framework for interfacing future coverage-driven fuzzers or symbolic execution tools. We also propose to use these new tools on a wide range of R packages in order to identify bugs in their C/C++ code.
One masters student will be recruited to implement this project during Jan-Dec 2020 at the School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems at Northern Arizona University. Interested students should apply by emailing a resume/CV along with a cover letter to project supervisors toby.hocking@nau.edu and alex.groce@nau.edu.",https://github.com/akhikolla/RcppDeepState
2019,2,Symbolic mathematics in R with SymPy,10000,Mikkel Meyer Andersen,"R's ability to do symbolic mathematics is largely restricted to finding derivatives. There are many tasks involving symbolic math that are of interest to R users, e.g. inversion of symbolic matrices, limits and solving non-linear equations. Users must resort to other software for such tasks and many R users (especially outside of academia) do not readily have access to such software.
The Python library SymPy is open source, has a stable group of developers and is powerful. As such, R users can just switch to Python and SymPy for symbolic math. However it is often very convenient to stay in the same environment to use familiar syntax and to utilise available libraries (e.g. to generate problems using symbolic math together with the exams package or to first handle symbolic computations and then afterwards move on to a numerical evaluations of the results). We will achieve this by making SymPy functionality available for R users via an R package.
Currently only few R packages for doing symbolic mathematics are available: Two of these are Ryacas and rSymPy. Ryacas is built around Yacas, and although Yacas can solve many problems and is extensible, the community is relatively small and Yacas is not as powerful as SymPy for certain routine tasks (e.g. integration and solving equations). rSymPy on the other hand is based on technology that requires much technical work to install and use.

2019,2,Tidy spatial networks in R,9000,"Lucas van der Meer, Robin Lovelace, Andrea Gilardi, Lorena Abad","R is currently lacking a generally applicable, modern and easy-to-use way of handling all kinds of spatial networks. ""Tidy spatial networks in R"" aims to address this issue by developing and publishing the sfnetworks package. The package, and documentation around it, will provide a bridge between network analysis and spatial analysis communities. For this, an sfnetwork class that will work with both tidygraph and sf frameworks and functions. R-users will be encouraged to contribute and engage with the package development during a hackathon organized next to the eRum 2020.",https://luukvdmeer.github.io/sfnetworks/
2019,2,d3po: R package for easy interactive D3 visualization with Shiny,4000,Mauricio Vargas Sepúlveda,"R already features excellent visualization libraries such as D3 (via the r2d3 package), plotly or highcharter. However, though those enable the creation of great looking visualisations they have very steep learning curves, require understanding of JavaScript or rely on non-free software that might be out of reach for governments and NGOs. Our intention is to solve those problems by releasing d3po. It shall be an intermediate layer between the user and D3 by providing “templates”, enabling high quality interactive visualizations oriented to and designed to be used with Shiny and Rmarkdown, and also proving easy internationalization.

2019,1,Enhancing usability of sample size calculations and power analyses in R with a Task View page and accompanying tutorials,13912,Richard Webster,"Sample size calculation and power analysis are fundamental for study design, yet they are challenging to do in the R programming language due to limited inter-package documentation. It is difficult to find the required functionality within the sea of open source packages. Indeed, there is no systematic R resource that allows users to search for whether a particular study design and corresponding statistical test has a power analysis implemented in R.
Our aims are to improve usability of power analyses performed in R, to facilitate proper design and analysis of data, and promote reproducible research.
Our duel approach is to create a Task View page for sample size calculations & power analyses, as well as a series of tutorials to reduce the R users' learning curve. Addressing the usability of sample size calculation / power analyses will benefit a broad spectrum of R users, as this is a vital component for study design, result interpretability and reproducibility.",https://cheori.org/samplesize/
2019,1,Expanding the ‘metaverse'; an R ecosystem for meta-research,20171,Martin Westgate,"Evidence synthesis is the process of identifying, collating and summarizing primary scientific research to provide reliable, transparent summaries such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Despite their importance for linking research with policy, however, evidence synthesis projects are often time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to update. Open and reproducible workflows would help address these problems, but these workflows are poorly supported by the current package environment, preventing access by new users and hindering uptake of the well-developed suite of statistical tools for meta-analysis in R. The metaverse project will integrate and expand tools to support evidence synthesis and meta-research in R; suggest flexible workflows to complete these projects in a straightforward and open manner; and provide a collector package allowing easy access to these developments for new and experienced users.",https://rmetaverse.github.io

2019,1,sftraj: A central class for tracking and movement data,10000,Mathieu Basille,"Movement defined broadly plays a central and growing role in fields as diverse as transportation, sport, ecology, music, medicine, and data science. Sampling movements results in tracking data, in the form of geographic (x,y,z) and temporal coordinates (t). Despite this common nature, there is a critical lack of standard infrastructure to deal with movement. With a sharp increase of the use of R for movement studies (more than 70 % of movement studies used R in 2018), the Movement community in R is at the same time very dynamic and very fragmented; in 2018 there was 57 packages that process, visualize and analyze tracking data, one third of which worked in isolation, not being linked to any other tracking package. We aim to develop a central trajectory class to support all stages of movement studies (pre-processing, post-processing and analysis).
We propose a sftraj package offering a generic and flexible approach. The only aim of the package will be to present a central class and basic functions to build, handle, summarize and plot movement data. Our project relies on three complementary pillars: a broad involvement of the movement community, a robust conceptual data model, and a sf-based implementation in R. The first stage of the work will specifically involve the Movement community in R. During this stage, we will open contributions of use cases for the package (using GitHub's issue system), which set practical goals for the development of the package. Use cases describe the workflow that is expected from both users' and developers' perspectives, and thus the capabilities that a trajectory package needs to offer. The package specifications and development will aim at addressing all use cases described, to make sure the solution provided is relevant for a wide array of users and package developers.",https://github.com/mablab/sftraj

2018,2,Next-generation text layout in grid and ggplot2,25000,Claus Wilke,"Text is a key component of any data visualization. We need to label axes and legends, we need to annotate or highlight specific data points, and we need to provide plot titles and captions. The R graphics package ggplot2 provides numerous features to customize the labeling and annotation of plots, but ultimately it is limited by the current capabilities of the underlying graphics libary it uses, grid. Grid can draw simple text strings or mathematical expressions (via plotmath) in different colors, sizes, and fonts. However, it lacks functionality for changing formatting within a string (e.g., draw a single word in italics or in a different color), and it also cannot draw text boxes, where the text is enclosed in a box with defined margins, padding, or background color. This project will support the development of a new package, gridtext, that will alleviate these text formatting limitations. The project will also support efforts to make these new capabilities available from within ggplot2.",https://wilkelab.org/gridtext/
2018,2,Strengthening of R in support of spatial data infrastructures management : geometa and ows4R R packages,20000,Emmanuel Blondel,"The project aims to strengthen the role of R in support of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) management, through major enhancements of the geometa R package which offers tools for reading and writing ISO/OGC geographic metadata, including ISO 19115, 19110, and 19119 through the ISO 19139 XML format. This also extends to the Geographic Markup Language (GML - ISO 19136) used for describing geographic data. The use of geometa in combination with publication tools such as ows4R ( https://cran.r-project.org/package=ows4R ) and geosapi (https://cran.r-project.org/package=geosapi) fosters the use of R software to ease the management and publication of metadata documents and related datasets in web catalogues, and then allows to move forward with a real R implementation of spatial data management plans based on FAIR (Findable, Accessible Interoperable and Reusable) principles.
The workplan includes several activities such as working on the completeness of the ISO 19115 (ISO 19115-1 and 19115-2) data model in geometa, functions to read/write multilingual metadata documents, and an increased metadata validation capability with a validator targeting the EU INSPIRE directive. Finally, functions will be made available to convert between geometa ISO/OGC metadata objects and other known metadata objects such as NetCDF-CF and EML (Ecological Metadata Language) to foster metadata interoperability. By providing these R tools, we seek to facilitate the work of spatial data (GIS) managers, but also data scientists, whatever the thematic domain, whose daily tasks consist in handling data, describing them with metadata and publishing datasets.",NA
2018,2,Symbolic Formulae for Linear Mixed Models,6000,Emi Tanaka,"Symbolic model formulae define the structural component of a statistical model in an easier and often more accessible terms for practitioners. The earlier instance of symbolic model formulae for linear models was applied in Genstat with further generalisation by Wilkinson and Rogers (1973). Chambers and Hastie (1993) describe the symbolic model formulae implementation for linear models in the S language which remains much the same in the R language (Venables et al. 2018).
Linear mixed models (LMMs) are widely used across many disciplines (e.g. ecology, psychology, agriculture, finance etc) due to its flexibility to model complex, correlated structures in the data. While the symbolic formula of linear models generally have a consistent representation and evaluation rule as implemented in stats::formula, this is not the case for LMMs. The inconsistency of symbolic formulae arises mainly in the representation of random effects, with the additional need to specify the variance-covariance structure of the random effects as well as structure of the associated model matrix that governs how the random effects are mapped to (groups of) the observational units. The differences give rise to confusion of equivalent model specification in different R-packages.
The lack of consistency in symbolic formula and model representation across mixed model software motivates the need to formulate a unified symbolic model formulae for LMMs with: (1) extension of the evaluation rules described in Wilkinson and Rogers (1973); and (2) ease of comprehension of the specified model for the user. This symbolic model formulae can be a basis for creating a common API to mixed models with wrappers to popular mixed model R-packages, thereby achieving a similar feat to parsnip R-package (Kuhn 2018) which implements a tidy unified interface to many predictive modelling functions (e.g. random forest, logistic regression, survival models etc).

2018,1,Developing Tools and Templates for Teaching Materials,10000,François Michonneau,"The first-class implementation of literate programming in R is one of the reasons for its success. While the seamless integration of code and text made possible by Sweave, knitr, and rmarkdown was designed for writing reproducible reports and documentation, it has also enabled the creation of teaching materials that combine text, code examples, exercises and solutions. However, while people creating lessons in RMarkdown are familiar with R, they often do not have a background in education or UX design. Therefore, they must not only assemble curriculum, but also find a way to present the content effectively and accessibly to both learners and instructors. As the model of open source development is being adapted to the creation of open educational resources, the difficulty to share materials due to a lack of consistency in their construction hinders the collaborative development of these resources.
This project will develop an R package that will facilitate the development of consistent teaching resources. It will encourage the use of tools and lesson structure that support and improve learning. By providing the technical framework for developing quality teaching materials, we seek to encourage collaborative lesson development by letting authors focus on the content rather than the formatting, while providing a more consistent experience for the learners.",https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/ and http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/
