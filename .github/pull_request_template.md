- [ ] `cleaning.R` has code to download and clean the dataset, resulting in descriptively-named data.frames.
- [ ] I ran `saving.R` to create `csv`s and `md` data dictionaries for each of my data.frames.
- [ ] I filled in descriptions for each variable in each of the `{dataset}.md` files.
- [ ] I edited the `intro.md` file to introduce my dataset.
- [ ] I included at least one image for my dataset as a `png` file.
- [ ] I completed the information in `meta.yaml`, including descriptive alt text for each image.
