# CONTRIBUTING

Thank you for contributing to this project, whether you have a dataset to share or a pull request to contribute! 
We're excited for people to engage with the project, and aim to address issues aligned with the [goals of the project](../README.md#goals) and respond to people as we can. 

This project is in Active mode, meaning we review this repository on a weekly basis, but we may not have time to address every issue. 
So, you might not hear from us right away, but we appreciate your contribution! 

There are several ways you can help:

- [Submit a dataset pull request](pr_instructions.md)
- [Review submitted dataset ideas](dataset_review.md)
- [Submit a dataset idea](dataset_idea.md)
- [Submit a bug report or feature request](#submitting-general-non-dataset-issues)

These guidelines are for first-time contributors to get you started. 
If you are a regular contributor, we may be working in a different mode, where the workflow is different. 

## Submitting general (non-dataset) issues

If you found something wrong or confusing with the project, please submit an issue! 

However, before you submit an issue, please search through existing issues to see if it's something someone already shared. You may be able to provide more information to an existing issue.

- Provide as much information as you can. We suggest submitting a [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) if it's an issue or bug. Also, see this [guide to writing good bug reports](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/wiki/Writing-Good-Bug-Reports) for more on how to write a great bug report.
- If it's an idea for a feature or change, please describe the change you're proposing, how you would plan to implement it (if you have an idea), and why it's important for the goals of the project. See this [guide to writing feature requests](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/wiki/Writing-Good-Feature-Requests) for more on how to write a great feature request.
- Use kind language aligned with [how we treat each other](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in this project.

## Expectations for response/review
