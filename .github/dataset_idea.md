# Submitting a dataset idea

Please consider [submitting the dataset through a pull request](pr_instructions.md) instead! This is the best way to help us.

Look through [existing dataset suggestions](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adataset) to see if the dataset you have in mind has already been suggested. You may be able to provide more information to an existing suggestion.

See our guide to [reviewing submitted datasets](dataset_review.md) for the checklist we will need to complete for the submitted dataset. The more you can do that in the initial issue, the better!

If you find yourself filling out *all* of the information, we strongly suggest submitting a pull request instead! We'll help you through the process if you've never submitted a pull request before!

You can [submit a dataset here](issues/new?assignees=&labels=dataset&projects=&template=dataset_template.md).
