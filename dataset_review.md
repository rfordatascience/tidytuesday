## Dataset Review

We identify, curate, and post a new dataset every week, 51 weeks per year.
To make that possible, we welcome [dataset submissions](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday?tab=readme-ov-file#submitting-datasets).
Once submitted, we need to verify that each dataset meet our standards.

You can help us identify usable datasets!
Read through our [open issues tagged with the dataset label](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adataset), and leave a comment after checking for each of these things.
If anything isn't provided in the original issue, but you can provide it, please do so!
For each checklist item, we link to open issues that have not been labeled for that item.

- [ ] [I can download the dataset from the link provided.](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adataset+-label%3A%22data%3A+no+data+link%22+-label%3A%22data%3A+has+data+link%22+)
- [ ] [The dataset will (probably) be less than 50MB when saved as a tidy CSV.](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adataset+-label%3A%22data%3A+too+large%22+-label%3A%22data%3A+has+usable+size%22+) 
- [ ] [There is a link to an article that has something to do with the dataset.](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adataset+-label%3A%22data%3A+no+article%22+-label%3A%22data%3A+has+article%22+)
- [ ] [I can imagine a data visualization related to this dataset.](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adataset+-label%3A%22data%3A+not+datavizable%22+-label%3A%22data%3A+datavizable%22+)
- [ ] [This dataset has not already been used in TidyTuesday.](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adataset)

Some bonus things to look for to help us prepare the dataset:

- [ ] [There are links to two images related to the dataset (or images are attached to the issue).](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adataset+-label%3A%22data%3A+no+images%22+-label%3A%22data%3A+has+images%22+)
- [ ] [ALT text is provided for all (both) images.](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adataset+-label%3A%22data%3A+no+image+alt+text%22+-label%3A%22data%3A+has+image+alt+text%22+)
- [ ] [There is a data dictionary describing the columns of the dataset.](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adataset+-label%3A%22data%3A+needs+data+dictionary%22+-label%3A%22data%3A+has+data+dictionary%22+)
- [ ] [The TidyTuesday maintainers are unlikely to get sued for using the dataset.](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adataset+-label%3A%22data%3A+provenance%22+-label%3A%22data%3A+usable+provenance%22+)

If enough users show interest in helping us out, we will try to add a [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) app to streamline the process!
