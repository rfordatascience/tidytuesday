## Dataset Review

We identify, curate, and post a new dataset every week, 51 weeks per year.
To make that possible, we welcome [dataset idea submissions](dataset_idea.md).
Once submitted, we need to verify that each dataset meets our standards.

You can help us identify usable datasets!
Read through our [open issues tagged with the dataset label](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adataset), and leave a comment after checking for each of these things.
Copy-paste this checklist as-is into your comment, then either add "x" between the `[ ]`, or save your issue and then click the checkboxes.
If anything isn't provided in the original issue, but you can provide it, please do so!

If enough users show interest in helping us out, we will try to add a [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) app to streamline the process!
