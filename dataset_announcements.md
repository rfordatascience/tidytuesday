## Weekly Dataset Announcements 

`TidyTuesday` is a *social* data project, which means we rely on social media.
We do our best to foster a safe, diverse, welcoming community where possible!

We post datasets to social media every Monday morning.
Data is currently posted at these locations:

- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jonthegeek.com)
- [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@jonthegeek)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lgibson7/)
- [GitHub](https://tidytues.day)
- [DSLC.io](https://dslc.io) Slack

Watch the #TidyTuesday, #DataViz, #RStats, and #PyData hashtags on your favorite social media platform!
As additional APIs become available, we will likely add additional networks, provided those networks support a safe, diverse, welcoming community.
