# CONTRIBUTING

Thank you for contributing to this project, whether you have a dataset to share or a pull request to contribute! 
We're excited for people to engage with the project, and aim to address issues aligned with the [goals of the project](README.md#goals) and respond to people as we can. 

This project is in Active mode, meaning we review this repository on a weekly basis, but we may not have time to address every issue. 
So, you might not hear from us right away, but we appreciate your contribution! 

Please see our guidelines that let us help you the best for 

- Submitting datasets
- Submitting issues
- Submitting pull requests
- Expectations for response/review

These guidelines are for first-time contributors to get you started. 
If you are a regular contributor, we may be working in a different mode, where the workflow is different. 

# Submitting datasets

- Look through [existing dataset suggestions](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adataset) to see if the dataset has already been suggested. You may be able to provide more information to an existing suggestion.
- Provide as much information as you can. We don't need all of this information in the initial issue, but we will need all of it before we can post the dataset (so more is better):
  - A short name for the dataset (to be used in the social media post, "This week we're exploring DATASET NAME").
  - A source where the dataset can be downloaded (as a URL).
  - Verification that the dataset is publicly available and legal for us to use.
  - A cleaning script to prepare one or more CSVs for the dataset, small enough to be hosted on GitHub. We might need to subset the data, remove redundant columns, or otherwise clean the data to make it small enough and clean enough to use.
  - An example of the dataset being used, such as a blog post or a README about the dataset.
  - Two images related to the dataset.
  - ALT text for the images.
  - A data dictionary for each CSV in the dataset, describing each column and its contents.

## Submitting issues

- Look through existing issues to see if it's something someone already shared. You may be able to provide more information to an existing issue.
- Provide as much information as you can. We suggest submitting a [reprex]() if it's an issue or bug. Also, see this [guide to writing good bug reports](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/wiki/Writing-Good-Bug-Reports) for more on how to write a great bug report.
- If it's an idea for a feature or change, please describe the change you're proposing, how you would plan to implement it (if you have an idea), and why it's important for the goals of the project. See this [guide to writing feature requests](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/wiki/Writing-Good-Feature-Requests) for more on how to write a great feature request.
- Use kind language aligned with [how we treat each other](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in this project.

## Submitting pull requests

- The title of the pull request should be informative.
- Ideally all pull requests should be linked to an issue. If you're considering a pull request not related to an existing issue, please submit an issue for discussion first. See this [guide to writing feature requests](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/wiki/Writing-Good-Feature-Requests) for more on how to write a great feature request.
- If you are fixing a typo or something along those lines, you do not need to create an issue first.
- With a PR describe what is solved through the PR, and document your code in the style of the project.
