> The highlight of the Sechseläuten, the traditional spring festival of the Zurich guilds, is the burning of the Böögg. 
The effigy, made of cotton wool, is set alight on a large pyre in the Sechseläutenplatz at six in the evening, 
on the sixth stroke of the bells of St Peter's Church. 
The time it takes for the Böögg to lose his firework-filled head is supposed to be a predictor of the coming summer weather. 
When the suffering is short-lived, this supposedly augurs well for a beautiful summer 
– a prediction which can be checked against meteorological data.
