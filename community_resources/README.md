# ALPHA VERSION

## Community Resources and Data

This is a secondary data repository for data that the `#rstats` community feels adds to the week's data. We will see how this goes, and makeadjustments as necessary.

Many thanks to Alyssa ([@wiremonkey](https://twitter.com/WireMonkey)) for the idea!

## Strategy and Requests

* Perform pull requests with data using a concise naming convention
  * Eg if the data is useful ONLY for week 13 please sumbit as week13_xxxxxx
  * If the data is general purpose (country ISO codes, etc), then feel free to use data_xxxxxx
* Please submit data that is clean and ready to go for that week or useful long term
* Future things to come!
