## About TidyTuesday

- `TidyTuesday` is a weekly social data project. All are welcome to participate! Please remember to share the code used to generate your results!
- `TidyTuesday` is organized by the [Data Science Learning Community](https://dslc.io). [Join our Slack](https://dslc.io/join) for free online help with R, Python, and other data-related topics, or to participate in a data-related book club!

## Goals

Our over-arching goal for TidyTuesday is to provide real-world datasets so that people can learn to work with data.

- [x] For 2024, our goal was to be used in at least 10 courses. Our survey indicates that we are used in at least 30 courses!
- [ ] For 2025, our goal is to crowdsource the curation of TidyTuesday datasets.

## How to Participate

- Data is [posted to social media](dataset_announcements.md) every Monday morning. Follow the instructions in the new post for how to download the data.
- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.

**You can also [curate a dataset for a future TidyTuesday](.github/pr_instructions.md)!**
