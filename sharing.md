## Sharing Your Output

We welcome all newcomers, enthusiasts, and experts to participate, but be mindful of these things:

1. The data set comes from the source article or the source that the article credits. Be mindful that the data is what it is! You are welcome to explore beyond the provided dataset, but the data is provided as a "toy" dataset to practice techniques on.  
2. This is NOT about criticizing the original article or graph. Real people made the graphs, collected or acquired the data! Focus on the provided dataset, learning, and improving your techniques in R.  
3. This is NOT about criticizing or tearing down your fellow data practitioners or their code! Be supportive and kind to each other! Like others' posts and help promote the data community!  
4. Use the hashtag #TidyTuesday on social media. You might also wish to add a language-specific hashtag: R: #RStats; Python: #PyData, #PydyTuesday; Julia: #JuliaLang, #TidierTuesday. On BlueSky, add the #DataBS (the BlueSky Data community) hashtag.
5. Include a picture of the visualization when you post to social media.  
6. Include alt text for any visualizations shared, so that everyone can participate! We have [an article with tips and tricks to help you with this aspect of data communication](alt_text.md). This is important for any images you share on social media, and is part of learning to be an effective data science communicator!
7. Include a copy of the code used to create your visualization when you post to social media.
8. Focus on improving your craft, even if you end up with something simple!  
9. Give credit to the original data source whenever possible.

For R, the [bskyr package](https://christophertkenny.com/bskyr/) is helpful for posting to [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), and the [rtoot package](https://schochastics.github.io/rtoot/) is helpful for posting to [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/tags/rstats).
